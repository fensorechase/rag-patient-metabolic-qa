        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Kidney stones are small, hard mineral deposits that form in the kidneys. They can be as small as a grain of sand or as large as a golf ball. In adults, kidney stones are common and often cause severe pain in the side and back, below the ribs, that will not go away. They can also cause nausea, vomiting, and blood in the urine. Some kidney stones can be treated with medication or sound waves to break them into smaller pieces, while others may require surgery. Drinking plenty of water can help prevent kidney stones.",
        "original_answer": "A kidney stone is a solid piece of material that forms in a kidney when substances that are normally found in the urine become highly concentrated. A stone may stay in the kidney or travel down the urinary tract. Kidney stones vary in size. A small stone may pass on its own, causing little or no pain. A larger stone may get stuck along the urinary tract and can block the flow of urine, causing severe pain or bleeding.\n                \nKidney stones are one of the most common disorders of the urinary tract. Each year in the United States, people make more than a million visits to health care providers and more than 300,000 people go to emergency rooms for kidney stone problems.1\n                \nUrolithiasis is the medical term used to describe stones occurring in the urinary tract. Other frequently used terms are urinary tract stone disease and nephrolithiasis. Terms that describe the location of the stone in the urinary tract are sometimes used. For example, a ureteral stoneor ureterolithiasisis a kidney stone found in the ureter.",

        "original_answer": "The urinary tract is the bodys drainage system for removing wastes and extra water. The urinary tract includes two kidneys, two ureters, a bladder, and a urethra. The kidneys are two bean-shaped organs, each about the size of a fist. They are located near the middle of the back, just below the rib cage, one on each side of the spine. Every day, the two kidneys process about 200 quarts of blood to produce about 1 to 2 quarts of urine, composed of wastes and extra water. The urine flows from the kidneys to the bladder through tubes called ureters. The bladder stores urine until releasing it through urination. When the bladder empties, urine flows out of the body through a tube called the urethra at the bottom of the bladder.",

        "original_answer": "Four major types of kidney stones can form:\n                \n- Calcium stones are the most common type of kidney stone and occur in two major forms: calcium oxalate and calcium phosphate. Calcium oxalate stones are more common. Calcium oxalate stone formation may be caused by high calcium and high oxalate excretion. Calcium phosphate stones are caused by the combination of high urine calcium and alkaline urine, meaning the urine has a high pH.  - Uric acid stones form when the urine is persistently acidic. A diet rich in purinessubstances found in animal protein such as meats, fish, and shellfishmay increase uric acid in urine. If uric acid becomes concentrated in the urine, it can settle and form a stone by itself or along with calcium.  - Struvite stones result from kidney infections. Eliminating infected stones from the urinary tract and staying infection-free can prevent more struvite stones.  - Cystine stones result from a genetic disorder that causes cystine to leak through the kidneys and into the urine, forming crystals that tend to accumulate into stones.",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Diagnosing kidney stones in adults typically involves the following steps:\n\n1. Medical history: The doctor will ask about symptoms, such as pain in the back, side, or abdomen, as well as any past medical issues or family history of kidney stones.\n2. Physical exam: The doctor may perform a physical exam to check for pain and tenderness in the abdomen and flank areas.\n3. Imaging tests: To confirm the presence of kidney stones, the doctor may order imaging tests such as a non-contrast helical computed tomography (CT) scan, ultrasound, or an X-ray called a KUB (kidney, ureter, bladder) scan.\n4. Blood and urine tests: The doctor may also order blood and urine tests to check for infection, assess kidney function, and look for crystals or stone fragments.\n\nIf the stone is too small to be seen on imaging tests, the doctor may perform a procedure called a retrograde pyelogram, which involves injecting dye into the urinary tract through a thin, flexible tube called a ureteroscope. This can help the doctor see the stone and determine its size and location.\n\nOverall, the specific diagnostic approach will depend on the individual patient's symptoms and medical history.",
        "original_answer": "To diagnose kidney stones, the health care provider will perform a physical exam and take a medical history. The medical history may include questions about family history of kidney stones, diet, GI problems, and other diseases and disorders. The health care provider may perform urine, blood, and imaging tests, such as an x ray or computerized tomography (CT) scan to complete the diagnosis.\n                \n- Urinalysis. Urinalysis is testing of a urine sample. The urine sample is collected in a special container in a health care providers office or commercial facility and can be tested in the same location or sent to a lab for analysis. Urinalysis can show whether the person has an infection or the urine contains substances that form stones.  - Blood test. A blood test involves drawing blood at a health care providers office or commercial facility and sending the sample to a lab for analysis. The blood test can show biochemical problems that can lead to kidney stones.  - Abdominal x ray. An abdominal x ray is a picture created using radiation and recorded on film or on a computer. The amount of radiation used is small. An x ray is performed at a hospital or outpatient center by an x-ray technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologista doctor who specializes in medical imaging. Anesthesia is not needed. The person will lie on a table or stand during the x ray. The x-ray machine is positioned over the abdominal area. The person will hold his or her breath as the picture is taken so that the picture will not be blurry. The person may be asked to change position for additional pictures. The x rays can show the location of stones in the kidney or urinary tract.  - CT scans. CT scans use a combination of x rays and computer technology to create three-dimensional (3-D) images. A CT scan may include the injection of a special dye, called contrast medium. CT scans require the person to lie on a table that slides into a tunnel-shaped device where the x rays are taken. The procedure is performed in an outpatient center or hospital by an x-ray technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologist. Anesthesia is not needed. CT scans can show stone locations and conditions that may have caused the stone to form.",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Treatment for kidney stones in adults depends on the size and location of the stone, as well as the symptoms it is causing. Here are some common treatment options:\n\n1. Pain relief: Over-the-counter pain medications like ibuprofen or naproxen can help manage the pain associated with kidney stones. In some cases, prescription pain medications may be necessary.\n2. Hydration: Drinking plenty of water can help flush small stones out of the urinary system.\n3. Medical expulsive therapy (MET): If the stone is small enough, your doctor may prescribe medication to help the stone pass more quickly and painlessly.\n4. Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL): This non-invasive procedure uses shock waves to break up the stone into smaller pieces that can be passed more easily.\n5. Ureteroscopy: A ureteroscope (a thin, flexible tube with a camera and instruments) is inserted into the urethra, bladder, and ureter to locate and remove the stone.\n6. Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PNL): For larger stones, a small incision is made in the back to access the kidney directly and remove the stone.\n\nIt's important to follow your doctor's recommendations for treatment and to seek medical attention if your symptoms worsen or you experience fever, chills, or severe pain.",
        "original_answer": "Treatment for kidney stones usually depends on their size and what they are made of, as well as whether they are causing pain or obstructing the urinary tract. Kidney stones may be treated by a general practitioner or by a urologista doctor who specializes in the urinary tract. Small stones usually pass through the urinary tract without treatment. Still, the person may need pain medication and should drink lots of fluids to help move the stone along. Pain control may consist of oral or intravenous (IV) medication, depending on the duration and severity of the pain. IV fluids may be needed if the person becomes dehydrated from vomiting or an inability to drink. A person with a larger stone, or one that blocks urine flow and causes great pain, may need more urgent treatment, such as\n                \n- Shock wave lithotripsy. A machine called a lithotripter is used to crush the kidney stone. The procedure is performed by a urologist on an outpatient basis and anesthesia is used. In shock wave lithotripsy, the person lies on a table or, less commonly, in a tub of water above the lithotripter. The lithotripter generates shock waves that pass through the persons body to break the kidney stone into smaller pieces to pass more readily through the urinary tract.  - Ureteroscopy. A ureteroscopea long, tubelike instrument with an eyepieceis used to find and retrieve the stone with a small basket or to break the stone up with laser energy. The procedure is performed by a urologist in a hospital with anesthesia. The urologist inserts the ureteroscope into the persons urethra and slides the scope through the bladder and into the ureter. The urologist removes the stone or, if the stone is large, uses a flexible fiber attached to a laser generator to break the stone into smaller pieces that can pass out of the body in the urine. The person usually goes home the same day.\n                \n- Percutaneous nephrolithotomy. In this procedure, a wire-thin viewing instrument called a nephroscope is used to locate and remove the stone. The procedure is performed by a urologist in a hospital with anesthesia. During the procedure, a tube is inserted directly into the kidney through a small incision in the persons back. For large stones, an ultrasonic probe that acts as a lithotripter may be needed to deliver shock waves that break the stone into small pieces that can be removed more easily. The person may have to stay in the hospital for several days after the procedure and may have a small tube called a nephrostomy tube inserted through the skin into the kidney. The nephrostomy tube drains urine and any residual stone fragments from the kidney into a urine collection bag. The tube is usually left in the kidney for 2 or 3 days while the person remains in the hospital.",

If you have a history of kidney stones or are at risk of developing them, it's important to speak with your doctor about a personalized prevention plan.",
        "original_answer": "The first step in preventing kidney stones is to understand what is causing the stones to form. The health care provider may ask the person to try to catch the kidney stone as it passes, so it can be sent to a lab for analysis. Stones that are retrieved surgically can also be sent to a lab for analysis.\n                \nThe health care provider may ask the person to collect urine for 24 hours after a stone has passed or been removed to measure daily urine volume and mineral levels. Producing too little urine or having a mineral abnormality can make a person more likely to form stones. Kidney stones may be prevented through changes in eating, diet, and nutrition and medications.\n                \nEating, Diet, and Nutrition\n                \nPeople can help prevent kidney stones by making changes in their fluid intake. Depending on the type of kidney stone a person has, changes in the amounts of sodium, animal protein, calcium, and oxalate consumed can also help.\n                \nDrinking enough fluids each day is the best way to help prevent most types of kidney stones. Health care providers recommend that a person drink 2 to 3 liters of fluid a day. People with cystine stones may need to drink even more. Though water is best, other fluids may also help prevent kidney stones, such as orange juice or lemonade. Talk with your health care provider if you cant drink the recommended amount due to other health problems, such as urinary incontinence, urinary frequency, or kidney failure.\n                \nRecommendations based on the specific type of kidney stone include the following:\n                \nCalcium Oxalate Stones\n                \n- reducing sodium  - reducing animal protein, such as meat, eggs, and fish  - getting enough calcium from food or taking calcium supplements with food  - avoiding foods high in oxalate, such as spinach, rhubarb, nuts, and wheat bran\n                \nCalcium Phosphate Stones\n                \n- reducing sodium  - reducing animal protein  - getting enough calcium from food or taking calcium supplements with food\n                \nUric Acid Stones\n                \n- limiting animal protein\n                \nMore information about how changes in diet affect kidney stone formation is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Diet for Kidney Stone Prevention.\n                \nMedications\n                \nThe health care provider may prescribe certain medications to help prevent kidney stones based on the type of stone formed or conditions that make a person more prone to form stones:\n                \n- hyperuricosuriaallopurinol (Zyloprim), which decreases uric acid in the blood and urine  - hypercalciuriadiuretics, such as hydrochlorothiazide  - hyperoxaluriapotassium citrate to raise the citrate and pH of urine  - uric acid stonesallopurinol and potassium citrate  - cystine stonesmercaptopropionyl glycine, which decreases cystine in the urine, and potassium citrate  - struvite stonesantibiotics, which are bacteria-fighting medications, when needed to treat infections, or acetohydroxamic acid with long-term antibiotic medications to prevent infection\n                \nPeople with hyperparathyroidism sometimes develop calcium stones. Treatment in these cases is usually surgery to remove the parathyroid glands. In most cases, only one of the glands is enlarged.

        "original_answer": "Vesicoureteral reflux is the abnormal flow of urine from the bladder to the upper urinary tract. The urinary tract is the bodys drainage system for removing wastes and extra water. The urinary tract includes two kidneys, two ureters, a bladder, and a urethra. Blood flows through the kidneys, and the kidneys filter out wastes and extra water, making urine. The urine travels down two narrow tubes called the ureters. The urine is then stored in a balloonlike organ called the bladder. When the bladder empties, urine flows out of the body through a tube called the urethra at the bottom of the bladder.\n                \nIn VUR, urine may flow backrefluxinto one or both ureters and, in some cases, to one or both kidneys. VUR that affects only one ureter and kidney is called unilateral reflux, and VUR that affects both ureters and kidneys is called bilateral reflux.",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) is a condition where urine flows backward from the bladder into the ureters and sometimes to the kidneys. This happens because of a problem with the valve-like mechanism that normally prevents urine from flowing backward. VUR can increase the risk of urinary tract infections (UTIs) and, in severe cases, can lead to kidney damage. It is often diagnosed in children but can also affect adults. Treatment depends on the severity of the condition and can include monitoring, medication, or surgery.",
        "original_answer": "The two types of VUR are primary and secondary. Most cases of VUR are primary and typically affect only one ureter and kidney. With primary VUR, a child is born with a ureter that did not grow long enough during the childs development in the womb. The valve formed by the ureter pressing against the bladder wall does not close properly, so urine refluxes from the bladder to the ureter and eventually to the kidney. This type of VUR can get better or disappear as a child gets older. As a child grows, the ureter gets longer and function of the valve improves.\n                \nSecondary VUR occurs when a blockage in the urinary tract causes an increase in pressure and pushes urine back up into the ureters. Children with secondary VUR often have bilateral reflux. VUR caused by a physical defect typically results from an abnormal fold of tissue in the urethra that keeps urine from flowing freely out of the bladder.\n                \nVUR is usually classified as grade I through V, with grade I being the least severe and grade V being the most severe.",

Physical examination: A general exam of the abdomen, back, and genitals may reveal any abnormalities.\n3. Imaging tests:\na. Voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG): This is the most common test used to diagnose VUR. A catheter is inserted into the bladder through the urethra, and a special dye is introduced. X-rays are taken while the bladder fills and empties to assess if there is any reflux of the dye into the ureters and kidneys.\nb. Renal ultrasound: This test uses sound waves to create images of the kidneys and bladder. It can help detect any abnormalities in the structure of the kidneys or bladder.\nc. Radionuclide cystogram (RNC): Similar to a VCUG, but uses a small amount of radioactive material instead of dye. This test is less invasive and exposes the patient to less radiation.\n\nThe diagnosis is based on the results of these tests and the severity of the reflux is often graded on a scale of I to V, with grade I being the mildest form and grade V being the most severe.",
        "original_answer": "The most common tests used to diagnose VUR include\n                \n- Voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG). VCUG is an x-ray image of the bladder and urethra taken during urination, also called voiding. The bladder and urethra are filled with a special dye, called contrast medium, to make the urethra clearly visible. The x-ray machine captures a video of the contrast medium when the child urinates. The procedure is performed in a health care providers office, outpatient center, or hospital by an x-ray technician supervised by a radiologista doctor who specializes in medical imagingwho then interprets the images. Anesthesia is not needed, but sedation may be used for some children. This test can show abnormalities of the inside of the urethra and bladder.  - Radionuclide cystogram (RNC). RNC is a type of nuclear scan that involves placing radioactive material into the bladder. A scanner then detects the radioactive material as the child urinates or after the bladder is empty. The procedure is performed in a health care providers office, outpatient center, or hospital by a specially trained technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologist. Anesthesia is not needed, but sedation may be used for some children. RNC is more sensitive than VCUG but does not provide as much detail of the bladder anatomy.  - Abdominal ultrasound. Ultrasound uses a device, called a transducer, that bounces safe, painless sound waves off organs to create an image of their structure. An abdominal ultrasound can create images of the entire urinary tract, including the kidneys and bladder. The procedure is performed in a health care providers office, outpatient center, or hospital by a specially trained technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologist; anesthesia is not needed. Ultrasound may be used before VCUG or RNC if the childs family or health care provider wants to avoid exposure to x-ray radiation or radioactive material.\n                \nTesting is usually done on\n                \n- infants diagnosed during pregnancy with urine blockage affecting the kidneys  - children younger than 5 years of age with a UTI  - children with a UTI and fever, called febrile UTI, regardless of age  - males with a UTI who are not sexually active, regardless of age or fever  - children with a family history of VUR, including an affected sibling\n                \nMore information about urine blockage in infants is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Urine Blockage in Newborns.\n                \nVUR is an unlikely cause of UTI in some children, so these tests are not done until other causes of UTI are ruled out for\n                \n- children 5 years of age and older with a UTI  - children with a UTI but no fever  - sexually active males with a UTI",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Acromegaly is a rare hormonal disorder that occurs when the body produces too much growth hormone (GH) after the growth plates in the bones have closed. This leads to abnormal growth of bones, especially in the face, hands, and feet, causing them to become larger and thicker. Symptoms may include enlarged features, joint pain, and organ enlargement. Acromegaly is usually caused by a noncancerous tumor in the pituitary gland and is typically treated with surgery, medication, or radiation therapy. Early diagnosis and treatment can help manage the symptoms and prevent complications.",
        "original_answer": "Acromegaly is a hormonal disorder that results from too much growth hormone (GH) in the body. The pituitary, a small gland in the brain, makes GH. In acromegaly, the pituitary produces excessive amounts of GH. Usually the excess GH comes from benign, or noncancerous, tumors on the pituitary. These benign tumors are called adenomas.\n                \nAcromegaly is most often diagnosed in middle-aged adults, although symptoms can appear at any age. If not treated, acromegaly can result in serious illness and premature death. Acromegaly is treatable in most patients, but because of its slow and often \"sneaky\" onset, it often is not diagnosed early or correctly. The most serious health consequences of acromegaly are type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, increased risk of cardiovascular disease, and arthritis. Patients with acromegaly are also at increased risk for colon polyps, which may develop into colon cancer if not removed.\n                \nWhen GH-producing tumors occur in childhood, the disease that results is called gigantism rather than acromegaly. A child's height is determined by the length of the so-called long bones in the legs. In response to GH, these bones grow in length at the growth platesareas near either end of the bone. Growth plates fuse after puberty, so the excessive GH production in adults does not result in increased height. However, prolonged exposure to excess GH before the growth plates fuse causes increased growth of the long bones and thus increased height. Pediatricians may become concerned about this possibility if a child's growth rate suddenly and markedly increases beyond what would be predicted by previous growth and how tall the child's parents are.",

Gradually, bone changes alter the patient's facial features: The brow and lower jaw protrude, the nasal bone enlarges, and the teeth space out.\n                \nOvergrowth of bone and cartilage often leads to arthritis. When tissue thickens, it may trap nerves, causing carpal tunnel syndrome, which results in numbness and weakness of the hands. Body organs, including the heart, may enlarge.\n                \nOther symptoms of acromegaly include\n                \n- joint aches  - thick, coarse, oily skin  - skin tags  - enlarged lips, nose, and tongue  - deepening of the voice due to enlarged sinuses and vocal cords  - sleep apnea-breaks in breathing during sleep due to obstruction of the airway  - excessive sweating and skin odor  - fatigue and weakness  - headaches  - impaired vision  - abnormalities of the menstrual cycle and sometimes breast discharge in women  - erectile dysfunction in men  - decreased libido",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Acromegaly is caused by the overproduction of growth hormone (GH) in the body, usually due to a benign tumor in the pituitary gland. This leads to abnormal growth and enlargement of bones and other tissues, resulting in the symptoms associated with acromegaly.",
        "original_answer": "Acromegaly is caused by prolonged overproduction of GH by the pituitary gland. The pituitary produces several important hormones that control body functions such as growth and development, reproduction, and metabolism. But hormones never seem to act simply and directly. They usually \"cascade\" or flow in a series, affecting each other's production or release into the bloodstream.\n                \nGH is part of a cascade of hormones that, as the name implies, regulates the physical growth of the body. This cascade begins in a part of the brain called the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus makes hormones that regulate the pituitary. One of the hormones in the GH series, or \"axis,\" is growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH), which stimulates the pituitary gland to produce GH.\n                \nSecretion of GH by the pituitary into the bloodstream stimulates the liver to produce another hormone called insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I). IGF-I is what actually causes tissue growth in the body. High levels of IGF-I, in turn, signal the pituitary to reduce GH production.\n                \nThe hypothalamus makes another hormone called somatostatin, which inhibits GH production and release. Normally, GHRH, somatostatin, GH, and IGF-I levels in the body are tightly regulated by each other and by sleep, exercise, stress, food intake, and blood sugar levels. If the pituitary continues to make GH independent of the normal regulatory mechanisms, the level of IGF-I continues to rise, leading to bone overgrowth and organ enlargement. High levels of IGF-I also cause changes in glucose (sugar) and lipid (fat) metabolism and can lead to diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart disease.\n                \nPituitary Tumors\n                \nIn more than 95 percent of people with acromegaly, a benign tumor of the pituitary gland, called an adenoma, produces excess GH. Pituitary tumors are labeled either micro- or macro-adenomas, depending on their size. Most GH-secreting tumors are macro-adenomas, meaning they are larger than 1 centimeter. Depending on their location, these larger tumors may compress surrounding brain structures. For example, a tumor growing upward may affect the optic chiasm-where the optic nerves crossleading to visual problems and vision loss. If the tumor grows to the side, it may enter an area of the brain called the cavernous sinus where there are many nerves, potentially damaging them.\n                \nCompression of the surrounding normal pituitary tissue can alter production of other hormones. These hormonal shifts can lead to changes in menstruation and breast discharge in women and erectile dysfunction in men. If the tumor affects the part of the pituitary that controls the thyroidanother hormone-producing glandthen thyroid hormones may decrease. Too little thyroid hormone can cause weight gain, fatigue, and hair and skin changes. If the tumor affects the part of the pituitary that controls the adrenal gland, the hormone cortisol may decrease. Too little cortisol can cause weight loss, dizziness, fatigue, low blood pressure, and nausea.\n                \nSome GH-secreting tumors may also secrete too much of other pituitary hormones. For example, they may produce prolactin, the hormone that stimulates the mammary glands to produce milk. Rarely, adenomas may produce thyroid-stimulating hormone. Doctors should assess all pituitary hormones in people with acromegaly.\n                \nRates of GH production and the aggressiveness of the tumor vary greatly among people with adenomas. Some adenomas grow slowly and symptoms of GH excess are often not noticed for many years. Other adenomas grow more rapidly and invade surrounding brain areas or the venous sinuses, which are located near the pituitary gland. Younger patients tend to have more aggressive tumors. Regardless of size, these tumors are always benign.\n                \nMost pituitary tumors develop spontaneously and are not genetically inherited. They are the result of a genetic alteration in a single pituitary cell, which leads to increased cell division and tumor formation. This genetic change, or mutation, is not present at birth, but happens later in life. The mutation occurs in a gene that regulates the transmission of chemical signals within pituitary cells. It permanently switches on the signal that tells the cell to divide and secrete GH. The events within the cell that cause disordered pituitary cell growth and GH oversecretion currently are the subject of intensive research.\n                \nNonpituitary Tumors\n                \nRarely, acromegaly is caused not by pituitary tumors but by tumors of the pancreas, lungs, and other parts of the brain. These tumors also lead to excess GH, either because they produce GH themselves or, more frequently, because they produce GHRH, the hormone that stimulates the pituitary to make GH. When these non-pituitary tumors are surgically removed, GH levels fall and the symptoms of acromegaly improve.\n                \nIn patients with GHRH-producing, non-pituitary tumors, the pituitary still may be enlarged and may be mistaken for a tumor. Physicians should carefully analyze all \"pituitary tumors\" removed from patients with acromegaly so they do not overlook the rare possibility that a tumor elsewhere in the body is causing the disorder.",

        "original_answer": "Small pituitary adenomas are common, affecting about 17 percent of the population.1 However, research suggests most of these tumors do not cause symptoms and rarely produce excess GH.2 Scientists estimate that three to four out of every million people develop acromegaly each year and about 60 out of every million people suffer from the disease at any time.3 Because the clinical diagnosis of acromegaly is often missed, these numbers probably underestimate the frequency of the disease.",

        "question_text": "How to diagnose Acromegaly ?",
        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Acromegaly is a rare condition characterized by the overproduction of growth hormone. Here's a simplified process for diagnosing Acromegaly:\n\n1. **Medical History and Physical Examination**: The doctor will first take a detailed medical history and perform a physical examination. They may notice signs such as enlarged hands, feet, or facial features.\n\n2. **Growth Hormone (GH) Levels**: If Acromegaly is suspected, the doctor will typically measure GH levels in the blood. However, GH levels vary throughout the day, making diagnosis difficult.\n\n3. **Insulin-like Growth Factor-1 (IGF-1) Test**: IGF-1 is a hormone produced in response to GH. Its levels remain fairly constant throughout the day, making it a better indicator of excessive GH. High IGF-1 levels suggest Acromegaly.\n\n4. **Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT)**: This test involves drinking a sugary drink and then having your blood sugar and GH levels checked at various intervals. In normal people, GH levels should drop to very low levels. In Acromegaly, the GH levels remain high.\n\n5. **Imaging Tests**: If blood tests suggest Acromegaly, imaging tests like MRI or CT scans are used to locate and evaluate the size of the pituitary tumor.\n\n6. **Other Tests**: Depending on the case, other tests may be done to assess the impact of Acromegaly on other organs, such as sleep studies, heart function tests, or X-rays to check for bone changes.\n\nRemember, only a healthcare professional can make a diagnosis. If you suspect you have Acromegaly, it's important to seek medical advice.",
        "original_answer": "Blood tests\n                \nIf acromegaly is suspected, a doctor must measure the GH level in a persons blood to determine if it is elevated. However, a single measurement of an elevated blood GH level is not enough to diagnose acromegaly: Because GH is secreted by the pituitary in impulses, or spurts, its concentration in the blood can vary widely from minute to minute. At a given moment, a person with acromegaly may have a normal GH level, whereas a GH level in a healthy person may even be five times higher.\n                \nMore accurate information is obtained when GH is measured under conditions that normally suppress GH secretion. Health care professionals often use the oral glucose tolerance test to diagnose acromegaly because drinking 75 to 100 grams of glucose solution lowers blood GH levels to less than 1 nanogram per milliliter (ng/ml) in healthy people. In people with GH overproduction, this suppression does not occur. The oral glucose tolerance test is a highly reliable method for confirming a diagnosis of acromegaly.\n                \nPhysicians also can measure IGF-I levels, which increase as GH levels go up, in people with suspected acromegaly. Because IGF-I levels are much more stable than GH levels over the course of the day, they are often a more practical and reliable screening measure. Elevated IGF-I levels almost always indicate acromegaly. However, a pregnant womans IGF-I levels are two to three times higher than normal. In addition, physicians must be aware that IGF-I levels decline with age and may also be abnormally low in people with poorly controlled diabetes or liver or kidney disease.\n                \nImaging\n                \nAfter acromegaly has been diagnosed by measuring GH or IGF-I levels, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the pituitary is used to locate and detect the size of the tumor causing GH overproduction. MRI is the most sensitive imaging technique, but computerized tomography (CT) scans can be used if the patient should not have MRI. For example, people who have pacemakers or other types of implants containing metal should not have an MRI scan because MRI machines contain powerful magnets.\n                \nIf a head scan fails to detect a pituitary tumor, the physician should look for non-pituitary \"ectopic\" tumors in the chest, abdomen, or pelvis as the cause of excess GH. The presence of such tumors usually can be diagnosed by measuring GHRH in the blood and by a CT scan of possible tumor sites.\n                \nRarely, a pituitary tumor secreting GH may be too tiny to detect even with a sensitive MRI scan.",

        "original_answer": "Currently, treatment options include surgical removal of the tumor, medical therapy, and radiation therapy of the pituitary.\n                \nGoals of treatment are to\n                \n- reduce excess hormone production to normal levels  - relieve the pressure that the growing pituitary tumor may be exerting on the surrounding brain areas  - preserve normal pituitary function or treat hormone deficiencies  - improve the symptoms of acromegaly\n                \nSurgery\n                \nSurgery is the first option recommended for most people with acromegaly, as it is often a rapid and effective treatment. The surgeon reaches the pituitary via an incision through the nose or inside the upper lip and, with special tools, removes the tumor tissue in a procedure called transsphenoidal surgery. This procedure promptly relieves the pressure on the surrounding brain regions and leads to a rapid lowering of GH levels. If the surgery is successful, facial appearance and soft tissue swelling improve within a few days.\n                \nSurgery is most successful in patients with blood GH levels below 45 ng/ml before the operation and with pituitary tumors no larger than 10 millimeters (mm) in diameter. Success depends in large part on the skill and experience of the surgeon, as well as the location of the tumor. Even with the most experienced neurosurgeon, the chance of a cure is small if the tumor has extended into critical brain structures or into the cavernous sinus where surgery could be risky.\n                \nThe success rate also depends on what level of GH is defined as a cure. The best measure of surgical success is normalization of GH and IGF-I levels. The overall rate of remission-control of the disease-after surgery ranges from 55 to 80 percent. (See For More Information to locate a board-certified neurosurgeon.)\n                \nA possible complication of surgery is damage to the surrounding normal pituitary tissue, which requires lifelong use of pituitary hormone replacement. The part of the pituitary that stores antidiuretic hormonea hormone important in water balancemay be temporarily or, rarely, permanently damaged and the patient may require medical therapy. Other potential problems include cerebrospinal fluid leaks and, rarely, meningitis. Cerebrospinal fluid bathes the brain and can leak from the nose if the incision area doesnt heal well. Meningitis is a bacterial or viral infection of the meninges, the outer covering of the brain.\n                \nEven when surgery is successful and hormone levels return to normal, people with acromegaly must be carefully monitored for years for possible recurrence of the disease. More commonly, hormone levels improve, but do not return to normal. Additional treatment, usually medications, may be required.\n                \nMedical Therapy\n                \nMedical therapy is most often used if surgery does not result in a cure and sometimes to shrink large tumors before surgery. Three medication groups are used to treat acromegaly.\n                \nSomatostatin analogs (SSAs) are the first medication group used to treat acromegaly. They shut off GH production and are effective in lowering GH and IGF-I levels in 50 to 70 percent of patients. SSAs also reduce tumor size in around 0 to 50 percent of patients but only to a modest degree. Several studies have shown that SSAs are safe and effective for long-term treatment and in treating patients with acromegaly caused by nonpituitary tumors. Long-acting SSAs are given by intramuscular injection once a month.\n                \nDigestive problems-such as loose stools, nausea, and gas-are a side effect in about half of people taking SSAs. However, the effects are usually temporary and rarely severe. About 10 to 20 percent of patients develop gallstones, but the gallstones do not usually cause symptoms. In rare cases, treatment can result in elevated blood glucose levels. More commonly, SSAs reduce the need for insulin and improve blood glucose control in some people with acromegaly who already have diabetes.\n                \nThe second medication group is the GH receptor antagonists (GHRAs), which interfere with the action of GH. They normalize IGF-I levels in more than 90 percent of patients. They do not, however, lower GH levels. Given once a day through injection, GHRAs are usually well-tolerated by patients. The long-term effects of these drugs on tumor growth are still under study. Side effects can include headaches, fatigue, and abnormal liver function.\n                \nDopamine agonists make up the third medication group. These drugs are not as effective as the other medications at lowering GH or IGF-I levels, and they normalize IGF-I levels in only a minority of patients. Dopamine agonists are sometimes effective in patients who have mild degrees of excess GH and have both acromegaly and hyperprolactinemiatoo much of the hormone prolactin. Dopamine agonists can be used in combination with SSAs. Side effects can include nausea, headache, and lightheadedness.\n                \nAgonist: A drug that binds to a receptor of a cell and triggers a response by the cell, mimicking the action of a naturally occurring substance.   Antagonist: A chemical that acts within the body to reduce the physiological activity of another chemical substance or hormone.\n                \nRadiation Therapy\n                \nRadiation therapy is usually reserved for people who have some tumor remaining after surgery and do not respond to medications. Because radiation leads to a slow lowering of GH and IGF-I levels, these patients often also receive medication to lower hormone levels. The full effect of this therapy may not occur for many years.\n                \nThe two types of radiation delivery are conventional and stereotactic. Conventional radiation delivery targets the tumor with external beams but can damage surrounding tissue. The treatment delivers small doses of radiation multiple times over 4 to 6 weeks, giving normal tissue time to heal between treatments.\n                \nStereotactic delivery allows precise targeting of a high-dose beam of radiation at the tumor from varying angles. The patient must wear a rigid head frame to keep the head still. The types of stereotactic radiation delivery currently available are proton beam, linear accelerator (LINAC), and gamma knife. With stereotactic delivery, the tumor must be at least 5 mm from the optic chiasm to prevent radiation damage. This treatment can sometimes be done in a single session, reducing the risk of damage to surrounding tissue.\n                \nAll forms of radiation therapy cause a gradual decline in production of other pituitary hormones over time, resulting in the need for hormone replacement in most patients. Radiation also can impair a patients fertility. Vision loss and brain injury are rare complications. Rarely, secondary tumors can develop many years later in areas that were in the path of the radiation beam.",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Acromegaly is a rare condition caused by excess growth hormone, usually due to a benign tumor in the pituitary gland. Treatment typically involves:\n\n1. Surgery: To remove the tumor in the pituitary gland. This is often the first treatment recommended.\n\n2. Medication: To reduce the production of growth hormone. This can be done with medications like somatostatin analogs, dopamine agonists, or growth hormone receptor antagonists.\n\n3. Radiation therapy: If surgery and medication are not effective, radiation therapy may be used to shrink the tumor and control the production of growth hormone.\n\nIt's important to note that treatment is most effective when started early. If you suspect you have acromegaly, it's crucial to seek medical attention promptly.",
        "original_answer": "No single treatment is effective for all patients. Treatment should be individualized, and often combined, depending on patient characteristics such as age and tumor size.\n                \nIf the tumor has not yet invaded surrounding nonpituitary tissues, removal of the pituitary adenoma by an experienced neurosurgeon is usually the first choice. Even if a cure is not possible, surgery may be performed if the patient has symptoms of neurological problems such as loss of peripheral vision or cranial nerve problems. After surgery, hormone levels are measured to determine whether a cure has been achieved. This determination can take up to 8 weeks because IGF-I lasts a long time in the body's circulation. If cured, a patient must be monitored for a long time for increasing GH levels.\n                \nIf surgery does not normalize hormone levels or a relapse occurs, an endocrinologist should recommend additional drug therapy. With each medication, long-term therapy is necessary because their withdrawal can lead to rising GH levels and tumor re-expansion.\n                \nRadiation therapy is generally reserved for patients whose tumors are not completely removed by surgery, who are not good candidates for surgery because of other health problems, or who do not respond adequately to surgery and medication.",

        "original_answer": "- Acromegaly is a hormonal disorder that results from too much growth hormone (GH) in the body.  - In most people with acromegaly, a benign tumor of the pituitary gland produces excess GH.  - Common features of acromegaly include abnormal growth of the hands and feet; bone growth in the face that leads to a protruding lower jaw and brow and an enlarged nasal bone; joint aches; thick, coarse, oily skin; and enlarged lips, nose, and tongue.  - Acromegaly can cause sleep apnea, fatigue and weakness, headaches, impaired vision, menstrual abnormalities in women, and erectile dysfunction in men.  - Acromegaly is diagnosed through a blood test. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pituitary is then used to locate and detect the size of the tumor causing GH overproduction.  - The first line of treatment is usually surgical removal of the tumor. Medication or radiation may be used instead of or in addition to surgery.",

        "original_answer": "In some people, high blood levels of prolactin can be traced to causes other than prolactinoma.\n                \nPrescription drugs. Prolactin secretion in the pituitary is normally suppressed by the brain chemical dopamine. Drugs that block the effects of dopamine at the pituitary or deplete dopamine stores in the brain may cause the pituitary to secrete prolactin. These drugs include older antipsychotic medications such as trifluoperazine (Stelazine) and haloperidol (Haldol); the newer antipsychotic drugs risperidone (Risperdal) and molindone (Moban); metoclopramide (Reglan), used to treat gastroesophageal reflux and the nausea caused by certain cancer drugs; and less often, verapamil, alpha-methyldopa (Aldochlor, Aldoril), and reserpine (Serpalan, Serpasil), used to control high blood pressure. Some antidepressants may cause hyperprolactinemia, but further research is needed.\n                \nOther pituitary tumors. Other tumors arising in or near the pituitary may block the flow of dopamine from the brain to the prolactin-secreting cells. Such tumors include those that cause acromegaly, a condition caused by too much growth hormone, and Cushing's syndrome, caused by too much cortisol. Other pituitary tumors that do not result in excess hormone production may also block the flow of dopamine.\n                \nHypothyroidism. Increased prolactin levels are often seen in people with hypothyroidism, a condition in which the thyroid does not produce enough thyroid hormone. Doctors routinely test people with hyperprolactinemia for hypothyroidism.\n                \nChest involvement. Nipple stimulation also can cause a modest increase in the amount of prolactin in the blood. Similarly, chest wall injury or shingles involving the chest wall may also cause hyperprolactinemia.",

Physical Examination: The doctor will perform a physical exam to check for any visible abnormalities, such as a pituitary tumor.\n3. Diagnostic Tests: The doctor may order blood tests to measure the levels of prolactin and other hormones in the blood. If the prolactin level is high, an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan may be done to confirm the presence of a pituitary tumor and determine its size and location.\n\nBased on the results of these tests, the doctor can make a diagnosis of Prolactinoma and develop an appropriate treatment plan.",
        "original_answer": "A doctor will test for prolactin blood levels in women with unexplained milk secretion, called galactorrhea, or with irregular menses or infertility and in men with impaired sexual function and, in rare cases, milk secretion. If prolactin levels are high, a doctor will test thyroid function and ask first about other conditions and medications known to raise prolactin secretion. The doctor may also request magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which is the most sensitive test for detecting pituitary tumors and determining their size. MRI scans may be repeated periodically to assess tumor progression and the effects of therapy. Computerized tomography (CT) scan also gives an image of the pituitary but is less precise than the MRI.\n                \nThe doctor will also look for damage to surrounding tissues and perform tests to assess whether production of other pituitary hormones is normal.

The most common treatment is medication that reduces prolactin levels and shrinks the tumor. This is usually a good option for small to medium-sized tumors. Surgery may be recommended for larger tumors that don't respond to medication, or if the medication causes significant side effects. Radiation therapy is usually used only if other treatments are not effective. It's important to note that treatment decisions should be made in consultation with a healthcare provider, taking into account the patient's individual circumstances and preferences.",
        "original_answer": "The goals of treatment are to return prolactin secretion to normal, reduce tumor size, correct any visual abnormalities, and restore normal pituitary function. In the case of large tumors, only partial achievement of these goals may be possible.\n                \nMedical Treatment\n                \nBecause dopamine is the chemical that normally inhibits prolactin secretion, doctors may treat prolactinoma with the dopamine agonists bromocriptine (Parlodel) or cabergoline (Dostinex). Agonists are drugs that act like a naturally occurring substance. These drugs shrink the tumor and return prolactin levels to normal in approximately 80 percent of patients. Both drugs have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of hyperprolactinemia. Bromocriptine is the only dopamine agonist approved for the treatment of infertility. This drug has been in use longer than cabergoline and has a well-established safety record.\n                \nNausea and dizziness are possible side effects of bromocriptine. To avoid these side effects, bromocriptine treatment must be started slowly. A typical starting dose is one-quarter to one-half of a 2.5 milligram (mg) tablet taken at bedtime with a snack. The dose is gradually increased every 3 to 7 days as needed and taken in divided doses with meals or at bedtime with a snack. Most people are successfully treated with 7.5 mg a day or less, although some people need 15 mg or more each day. Because bromocriptine is short acting, it should be taken either twice or three times daily.\n                \nBromocriptine treatment should not be stopped without consulting a qualified endocrinologist-a doctor specializing in disorders of the hormone-producing glands. Prolactin levels rise again in most people when the drug is discontinued. In some, however, prolactin levels remain normal, so the doctor may suggest reducing or discontinuing treatment every 2 years on a trial basis.\n                \nCabergoline is a newer drug that may be more effective than bromocriptine in normalizing prolactin levels and shrinking tumor size. Cabergoline also has less frequent and less severe side effects. Cabergoline is more expensive than bromocriptine and, being newer on the market, its long-term safety record is less well defined. As with bromocriptine therapy, nausea and dizziness are possible side effects but may be avoided if treatment is started slowly. The usual starting dose is .25 mg twice a week. The dose may be increased every 4 weeks as needed, up to 1 mg two times a week. Cabergoline should not be stopped without consulting a qualified endocrinologist.\n                \nRecent studies suggest prolactin levels are more likely to remain normal after discontinuing long-term cabergoline therapy than after discontinuing bromocriptine. More research is needed to confirm these findings.\n                \nIn people taking cabergoline or bromocriptine to treat Parkinson's disease at doses more than 10 times higher than those used for prolactinomas, heart valve damage has been reported. Rare cases of valve damage have been reported in people taking low doses of cabergoline to treat hyperprolactinemia. Before starting these medications, the doctor will order an echocardiogram. An echocardiogram is a sonogram of the heart that checks the heart valves and heart function.\n                \nBecause limited information exists about the risks of long-term, low-dose cabergoline use, doctors generally prescribe the lowest effective dose and periodically reassess the need for continuing therapy. People taking cabergoline who develop symptoms of shortness of breath or swelling of the feet should promptly notify their physician because these may be signs of heart valve damage.\n                \nSurgery\n                \nSurgery to remove all or part of the tumor should only be considered if medical therapy cannot be tolerated or if it fails to reduce prolactin levels, restore normal reproduction and pituitary function, and reduce tumor size. If medical therapy is only partially successful, it should be continued, possibly combined with surgery or radiation.\n                \nMost often, the tumor is removed through the nasal cavity. Rarely, if the tumor is large or has spread to nearby brain tissue, the surgeon will access the tumor through an opening in the skull.\n                \nThe results of surgery depend a great deal on tumor size and prolactin levels as well as the skill and experience of the neurosurgeon. The higher the prolactin level before surgery, the lower the chance of normalizing serum prolactin. Serum is the portion of the blood used in measuring prolactin levels. In the best medical centers, surgery corrects prolactin levels in about 80 percent of patients with small tumors and a serum prolactin less than 200 nanograms per milliliter (ng/ml). A surgical cure for large tumors is lower, at 30 to 40 percent. Even in patients with large tumors that cannot be completely removed, drug therapy may be able to return serum prolactin to the normal range-20 ng/ml or less-after surgery. Depending on the size of the tumor and how much of it is removed, studies show that 20 to 50 percent will recur, usually within 5 years.\n                \nBecause the results of surgery are so dependent on the skill and knowledge of the neurosurgeon, a patient should ask the surgeon about the number of operations he or she has performed to remove pituitary tumors and for success and complication rates in comparison to major medical centers. The best results come from surgeons who have performed hundreds or even thousands of such operations. To find a surgeon, contact The Pituitary Society (see For More Information).\n                \nRadiation\n                \nRarely, radiation therapy is used if medical therapy and surgery fail to reduce prolactin levels. Depending on the size and location of the tumor, radiation is delivered in low doses over the course of 5 to 6 weeks or in a single high dose. Radiation therapy is effective about 30 percent of the time.",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Henoch-Schönlein Purpura (HSP) is a condition that causes inflammation in the blood vessels, most commonly in children. It is characterized by a rash (purpura) on the skin, joint pain, gastrointestinal symptoms, and potentially kidney problems. The rash is caused by bleeding under the skin and appears as purple or red spots, often on the legs, buttocks, and elbows. HSP is usually triggered by an infection or a reaction to medication. While there is no cure for HSP, symptoms typically resolve on their own within a few weeks. Treatment is focused on managing symptoms and preventing complications.",
        "original_answer": "Henoch-Schnlein purpura is a disease that causes small blood vessels in the body to become inflamed and leak. The primary symptom is a rash that looks like many small raised bruises. HSP can also affect the kidneys, digestive tract, and joints. HSP can occur any time in life, but it is most common in children between 2 and 6 years of age.1 Most people recover from HSP completely, though kidney damage is the most likely long-term complication. In adults, HSP can lead to chronic kidney disease (CKD) and kidney failure, described as end-stage renal disease when treated with blood-filtering treatments called dialysis or a kidney transplant.",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Henoch-Schönlein Purpura (HSP) is an autoimmune condition that typically occurs after a respiratory infection. It's caused when the immune system mistakenly attacks blood vessels in the skin, joints, and kidneys, leading to inflammation and purple spots on the skin. The exact cause is not fully understood, but it's believed that genetic and environmental factors may also play a role. It's most common in children, and usually resolves on its own within a few weeks or months.",
        "original_answer": "Henoch-Schnlein purpura is caused by an abnormal immune system response in which the bodys immune system attacks the bodys own cells and organs. Usually, the immune system makes antibodies, or proteins, to protect the body from foreign substances such as bacteria or viruses. In HSP, these antibodies attack the blood vessels. The factors that cause this immune system response are not known. However, in 30 to 50 percent of cases, people have an upper respiratory tract infection, such as a cold, before getting HSP.2 HSP has also been associated with\n                \n- infectious agents such as chickenpox, measles, hepatitis, and HIV viruses  - medications  - foods  - insect bites  - exposure to cold weather  - trauma\n                \nGenetics may increase the risk of HSP, as it has occurred in different members of the same family, including in twins.",

Involvement of at least one other organ system, such as the kidneys, gastrointestinal tract, or joints.\n3. No other underlying condition that could explain the symptoms.\n\nLaboratory tests, such as urinalysis, complete blood count, and stool tests, may be ordered to assess the involvement of other organ systems and to rule out other possible causes of the symptoms. In some cases, a skin biopsy or other diagnostic tests may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.\n\nIt is important to consult with a healthcare professional if you suspect you have HSP, as early diagnosis and treatment can help prevent complications and improve outcomes.",

These deposits can be detected using a skin biopsy, a procedure that involves taking a piece of skin tissue for examination with a microscope. A skin biopsy is performed by a health care provider in a hospital with little or no sedation and local anesthetic. The skin tissue is examined in a lab by a pathologista doctor who specializes in diagnosing diseases.\n                \nA kidney biopsy may also be needed. A kidney biopsy is performed by a health care provider in a hospital with light sedation and local anesthetic. The health care provider uses imaging techniques such as ultrasound or a computerized tomography scan to guide the biopsy needle into the organ. The kidney tissue is examined in a lab by a pathologist. The test can confirm diagnosis and be used to determine the extent of kidney involvement, which will help guide treatment decisions.\n                \nHematuria and proteinuria are detected using urinalysis, which is testing of a urine sample. The urine sample is collected in a special container in a health care providers office or commercial facility and can be tested in the same location or sent to a lab for analysis. For the test, a nurse or technician places a strip of chemically treated paper, called a dipstick, into the urine sample. Patches on the dipstick change color when blood or protein are present in urine.",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "To diagnose Nephrotic Syndrome in adults, a doctor would typically follow these steps:\n\n1. Medical History: The doctor will ask about symptoms, medical history, and family history of kidney disease.\n2. Physical Examination: A physical exam may reveal signs of Nephrotic Syndrome, such as swelling in the legs, ankles, or feet.\n3. Urine Tests: A urinalysis can detect protein in the urine, which is a key indicator of Nephrotic Syndrome.\n4. Blood Tests: Blood tests can measure the levels of protein and cholesterol in the blood. Low protein levels and high cholesterol levels can be signs of Nephrotic Syndrome.\n5. Imaging Tests: Imaging tests, such as an ultrasound or CT scan, can provide images of the kidneys to check for abnormalities.\n6. Kidney Biopsy: In some cases, a kidney biopsy may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and determine the cause of Nephrotic Syndrome.\n\nIt is important to note that only a healthcare professional can diagnose Nephrotic Syndrome. If you are experiencing symptoms, it is important to seek medical attention.",
        "original_answer": "Urine samples are taken to diagnose people suspected of having nephrotic syndrome.\n                \nNephrotic syndrome is diagnosed when large amounts of protein are found in the urine. The blood protein albumin makes up much of the protein that is lost, though many other important proteins are also lost in nephrotic syndrome.\n                \nThe presence of albumin in the urine can be detected with a dipstick test performed on a urine sample. The urine sample is collected in a special container in a health care providers office or commercial facility and can be tested in the same location or sent to a lab for analysis. For the test, a nurse or technician places a strip of chemically treated paper, called a dipstick, into the urine. Patches on the dipstick change color when protein is present in urine.\n                \nA more precise measurement is usually needed to confirm the diagnosis. Either a single urine sample or a 24-hour collection of urine can be sent to a lab for analysis. With the single urine sample, the lab measures both albumin and creatinine, a waste product of normal muscle breakdown. The comparison of the measurements is called a urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio. A urine sample containing more than 30 milligrams of albumin for each gram of creatinine may signal a problem. With a 24-hour collection of urine, the lab measures only the amount of albumin present. The single urine sample is easier to collect than the 24-hour sample and is usually sufficient to confirm diagnosis, though the 24-hour collection may be used in some cases.\n                \nOnce nephrotic syndrome is diagnosed, blood tests are usually needed to check for systemic diseases that may be causing the nephrotic syndrome and to find out how well the kidneys are working overall. A blood test involves drawing blood at a health care providers office or commercial facility and sending the sample to a lab for analysis.\n                \nThough blood tests can point toward systemic diseases, a kidney biopsy is usually needed to diagnose the specific underlying disease causing the nephrotic syndrome and to determine the best treatment. A kidney biopsy is a procedure that involves taking a piece of kidney tissue for examination with a microscope. Kidney biopsies are performed by a health care provider in a hospital with light sedation and local anesthetic. A biopsy is often not needed for a person with diabetes because the persons medical history and lab tests may be enough to diagnose the problem as being a result of diabetes.",

        "original_answer": "Treating nephrotic syndrome includes addressing the underlying cause as well as taking steps to reduce high blood pressure, edema, high cholesterol, and the risks of infection. Treatment usually includes medications and changes in diet.\n                \nMedications that lower blood pressure can also significantly slow the progression of kidney disease causing nephrotic syndrome. Two types of blood pressure lowering medications, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), have proven effective in slowing the progression of kidney disease by reducing the pressure inside the glomeruli and thereby reducing proteinuria. Many people require two or more medications to control their blood pressure. In addition to an ACE inhibitor or an ARB, a diuretica medication that aids the kidneys in removing fluid from the bloodcan also be useful in helping to reduce blood pressure as well as edema. Beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, and other blood pressure medications may also be needed.\n                \nStatin medications may be given to lower cholesterol.\n                \nPeople with nephrotic syndrome should receive the pneumococcal vaccine, which helps protect against a bacterium that commonly causes infection, and yearly flu shots.\n                \nBlood thinning medications are usually only given to people with nephrotic syndrome who develop a blood clot; these medications are not used as a preventive measure.\n                \nNephrotic syndrome may go away once the underlying cause has been treated.

Once a health care provider is sure a person has medullary sponge kidney, treatment focuses on\n                \n- curing an existing UTI  - removing any kidney stones\n                \nCuring an Existing Urinary Tract Infection\n                \nTo treat a UTI, the health care provider may prescribe a medication called an antibiotic that kills bacteria. The choice of medication and length of treatment depend on the persons medical history and the type of bacteria causing the infection. More information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Urinary Tract Infections in Adults.\n                \nRemoving Kidney Stones\n                \nTreatment for kidney stones usually depends on their size and what they are made of, as well as whether they are causing pain or obstructing the urinary tract. Kidney stones may be treated by a general practitioner or by a urologista doctor who specializes in the urinary tract.\n                \nSmall stones usually pass through the urinary tract without treatment. Still, the person may need pain medication and should drink lots of liquids to help move the stone along. Pain control may consist of oral or intravenous (IV) medication, depending on the duration and severity of the pain. People may need IV fluids if they become dehydrated from vomiting or an inability to drink.\n                \nA person with a larger stone, or one that blocks urine flow and causes great pain, may need more urgent treatment, such as\n                \n- shock wave lithotripsy. A machine called a lithotripter is used to break up the kidney stone into smaller pieces to pass more easily through the urinary tract. The patient may need local or general anesthesia.  - ureteroscopy. A ureteroscopea long, tubelike instrument with an eyepieceis used to find and retrieve the stone with a small basket or to break the stone up with laser energy. Local or general anesthesia may be required.  - percutaneous nephrolithotomy. In this procedure, a wire-thin viewing instrument, called a nephroscope, is used to locate and remove the stones. During the procedure, which requires general anesthesia, a tube is inserted directly into the kidney through a small incision in the patients back.\n                \nMore information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Kidney Stones in Adults.",

A person should drink enough liquid to produce about 2 to 2.5 quarts of urine every day.3  - Reducing sodium intake, mostly from salt, may help prevent kidney stones. Diets high in sodium can increase the excretion of calcium into the urine and thus increase the chance of calciumcontaining kidney stones forming.  - Foods rich in animal proteins such as meat, eggs, and fish can increase the chance of uric acid stones and calcium stones forming. People who form stones should limit their meat consumption to 6 to 8 ounces a day.4  - People who are more likely to develop calcium oxalate stones should include 1,000 milligrams of calcium in their diet every day. Adults older than 50 years should consume 1,200 milligrams of calcium daily.3 Calcium in the digestive tract binds to oxalate from food and keeps it from entering the blood and the urinary tract, where it can form stones.\n                \nPeople with medullary sponge kidney should talk with their health care provider or a dietitian before making any dietary changes.

You can then dispose of the used dialysis solution, which is now full of wastes and extra fluid, in a toilet or down the drain of a sink or bathtub. Then you start over with a fresh bag of dialysis solution.\n                \nThe process of first draining the used dialysis solution and then replacing it with fresh solution is called an exchange. Most people do four to six exchanges every day, or during the night using a machine that moves the fluid in and out.

If one schedule or type of peritoneal dialysis does not suit you, you can talk with your doctor about trying another type.\n                \n- Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis does not require a machine. You can do it in any clean, well-lit place. The time period that the dialysis solution is in your belly is called the dwell time. With continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis, the dialysis solution stays in your belly for a dwell time of 4 to 6 hours, or more. Each exchange takes about 30 to 40 minutes. During an exchange, you can read, talk, watch television, or sleep. Usually, you change the dialysis solution at least four times a day and sleep with solution in your belly at night. You do not have to wake up and perform exchanges during the night.  - Automated peritoneal dialysis uses a machine called a cycler to fill and empty your belly three to five times during the night while you sleep. In the morning, you begin one exchange with a daylong dwell time. You may do an additional exchange around the middle of the afternoon without the cycler to increase the amount of waste removed and reduce the amount of fluid left behind in your body.\n                \nIf you weigh more than 175 pounds or if your peritoneum filters wastes slowly, you may need a combination of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis and automated peritoneal dialysis.

Training: Before starting peritoneal dialysis, you will receive training on how to perform the procedure at home. This includes learning how to insert the catheter, perform exchanges (the process of filling and draining the abdomen with dialysis solution), and care for the catheter site.\n2. Dialysis solution: A sterile dialysis solution is used to clean the blood of waste and excess fluid. The solution contains a mixture of glucose, electrolytes, and water. The glucose in the solution helps to remove waste and excess fluid from the body by creating an osmotic pressure gradient.\n3. Catheter: A soft, flexible tube called a catheter is inserted into the abdomen during a short surgical procedure. The catheter is used to fill the abdomen with dialysis solution and drain the used solution.\n4.

        "original_answer": "Eating the right foods can help you feel better while on peritoneal dialysis. Talk with your dialysis centers dietitian to find a meal plan that works for you. Your dietary needs will depend on your treatment and other factors such as your weight and activity level. Staying healthy with CKD requires watching what is in your diet:\n                \n- Protein is in foods from animals and plants. Protein provides the building blocks that maintain and repair muscles, organs, and other parts of your body. Peritoneal dialysis can remove proteins from your body, so eat high-quality, protein-rich foods such as meat, fish, and eggs. However, many high-protein foods also contain phosphorous, which can weaken your bones. Talk with your dietitian about ways to get the protein you need without getting too much phosphorous.  - Phosphorus is a mineral that helps your bones stay healthy and your blood vessels and muscles work. Phosphorus is a natural part of foods rich in protein, and food producers often add it to many processed foods. Phosphorus can weaken your bones and make your skin itch if you consume too much. Peritoneal dialysis may not remove enough phosphorus from your body, so you will probably need to limit or avoid high-phosphorus foods such as milk and cheese, dried beans, peas, colas, nuts, and peanut butter. You may also need to take a pill called a phosphate binder that keeps phosphorus in your food from entering your bloodstream.  - Fluid includes water and drinks such as fruit juice and milk and water in foods such as fruits, vegetables, ice cream, gelatin, soup, and ice pops. You need water for your body to function properly; however, too much can cause swelling and make your heart work harder. Over time, having too much fluid in your body can cause high blood pressure and congestive heart failure. Peritoneal dialysis might cause you to have either too much or too little fluid, depending on the strength of the solution you use. Your diet can also influence whether you have too much or too little fluid. Your dietitian will help you determine how much liquid you need to consume each day.  - Sodium is a part of salt. Many canned, packaged, frozen, and fast foods contain sodium. Sodium is also a part of many condiments, seasonings, and meats. Too much sodium makes you thirsty, which makes you drink more liquid. Try to eat fresh foods that are naturally low in sodium, and look for products that say low sodium on the label, especially in canned and frozen foods.  - Potassium is a mineral that helps your nerves and muscles work the right way. Peritoneal dialysis can pull too much potassium from your blood, so you may need to eat more high-potassium foods such as bananas, oranges, potatoes, and tomatoes. However, be careful not to eat too much potassium. Your dietitian will help you choose the right amount.  - Calories are units for measuring the energy provided by foods and drinks. Eating foods with too many calories, such as oily and sugary foods, can make you gain weight. Your body can absorb the dextrose from your dialysis solution, which can increase your calorie intake. You may find you need to take in fewer calories to prevent weight gain. Your dietitian can help you create and follow a diet to stay at a healthy weight.  - Supplements help provide some of the vitamins and minerals that may be missing from your diet. Peritoneal dialysis also removes some vitamins from your body. Your doctor may prescribe a vitamin and mineral supplement that scientists have designed specifically for people with CKD and kidney failure. Never take vitamin and mineral supplements that you can buy over the counter. They may be harmful to you. Talk with your doctor before taking any medicine, including vitamin and mineral supplements, that he or she has not prescribed for you.\n                \nYou may have a difficult time changing your diet at first. Eating the right foods will help you feel better. You will have more strength and energy.

You can perform exchanges manually (continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis or CAPD) or use a machine (automated peritoneal dialysis or APD) while you sleep.\n4. It is essential to maintain good hygiene and care for the catheter to prevent infections.\n\nPeritoneal dialysis offers several advantages, such as:\n\n* More flexibility in daily activities\n* Less dietary restrictions\n* Fewer fluctuations in blood pressure\n* Less need for medications\n\nHowever, peritoneal dialysis may not be suitable for everyone. Discuss your options with your healthcare provider to determine the best treatment method for your kidney failure.",
        "original_answer": "- Peritoneal dialysis is a treatment for kidney failure that uses the lining of your abdomen, or belly, to filter your blood inside your body.  - The two types of peritoneal dialysis are continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis and automated peritoneal dialysis.  - The most common problem with peritoneal dialysis is peritonitis, a serious abdominal infection.  - When dialysis solution stays in the body too long, it becomes so full of wastes and extra fluid that it cannot absorb any more from the body. The process may even reverse, letting some wastes and extra fluid back into the body.  - Eating the right foods can help you feel better while on peritoneal dialysis. Talk with your dialysis centers dietitian to find a meal plan that works for you.",

        "original_answer": "The kidneys are two bean-shaped organs, each about the size of a fist. They are located just below the rib cage, one on each side of the spine. Every day, the two kidneys filter about 120 to 150 quarts of blood to produce about 1 to 2 quarts of urine, composed of wastes and extra fluid. Children produce less urine than adults and the amount produced depends on their age. The urine flows from the kidneys to the bladder through tubes called ureters. The bladder stores urine. When the bladder empties, urine flows out of the body through a tube called the urethra, located at the bottom of the bladder.",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS) in children is typically diagnosed through a combination of medical history, physical examination, and laboratory tests. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Medical History: The doctor will ask about the child's symptoms, recent infections, family history of kidney disease, and any medications they are currently taking.\n\n2. Physical Examination: The doctor will perform a physical examination to check for signs of HUS, such as high blood pressure, swelling in the legs or arms, and bruising or pallor in the skin.\n\n3. Laboratory Tests: If HUS is suspected, the doctor will order laboratory tests to confirm the diagnosis. These tests may include:\n\n   a. Complete Blood Count (CBC): This test measures the number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets in the blood. In HUS, the number of red blood cells is usually low, and the number of platelets is usually high.\n\n   b. Coagulation Tests: These tests measure the time it takes for the blood to clot. In HUS, the clotting time may be prolonged.\n\n   c. Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) and Creatinine: These tests measure the levels of waste products in the blood. In HUS, the levels of these waste products are usually elevated.\n\n   d. Peripheral Blood Smear: This test looks for signs of hemolysis (the breakdown of red blood cells) in the blood. In HUS, the blood smear may show fragmented red blood cells.\n\n   e. Urinalysis: This test checks the urine for signs of protein and blood. In HUS, the urine may contain both.\n\n   f. Stool Culture: This test checks the stool for the presence of Shiga toxin, which is produced by certain strains of E. coli bacteria. The presence of Shiga toxin in the stool suggests that HUS was caused by an E. coli infection.\n\nIf the above tests confirm the diagnosis of HUS, further tests may be needed to determine the underlying cause and to monitor the child's kidney function. These tests may include:\n\n1. Abdominal Ultrasound: This test uses sound waves to create images of the abdominal organs, including the kidneys",

A dipstick test performed on a urine sample can detect the presence of albumin in the urine, which could mean kidney damage. The child or caretaker collects a urine sample in a special container in a health care provider's office or a commercial facility. For the test, a nurse or technician places a strip of chemically treated paper, called a dipstick, into the child's urine sample. Patches on the dipstick change color when albumin is present in the urine.\n                \nUrine albumin-to-creatinine ratio. A health care provider uses this measurement to estimate the amount of albumin passed into the urine over a 24-hour period. The child provides a urine sample during an appointment with the health care provider. Creatinine is a waste product that is filtered in the kidneys and passed in the urine. A high urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio indicates that the kidneys are leaking large amounts of albumin into the urine.\n                \nBlood Test\n                \nA blood test involves drawing blood at a health care provider's office or a commercial facility and sending the sample to a lab for analysis. A health care provider will test the blood sample to\n                \n- estimate how much blood the kidneys filter eachminute, called the estimated glomerular filtrationrate, or eGFR. The test results help the healthcare provider determine the amount of kidneydamage from hemolytic uremic syndrome.  - check red blood cell and platelet levels.  - check for liver and kidney function.  - assess protein levels in the blood.\n                \nStool Test\n                \nA stool test is the analysis of a sample of stool. The health care provider will give the child's parent or caretaker a container for catching and storing the stool. The parent or caretaker returns the sample to the health care provider or a commercial facility that will send the sample to a lab for analysis. Stool tests can show the presence of E. coli O157:H7.\n                \nKidney Biopsy\n                \nBiopsy is a procedure that involves taking a small piece of kidney tissue for examination with a microscope. A health care provider performs the biopsy in an outpatient center or a hospital. The health care provider will give the child light sedation and local anesthetic; however, in some cases, the child will require general anesthesia. A pathologista doctor who specializes in diagnosing diseasesexamines the tissue in a lab. The pathologist looks for signs of kidney disease and infection. The test can help diagnose hemolytic uremic syndrome.",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS) is a serious condition that typically occurs after a bacterial infection, often involving the digestive system. In children, it is usually caused by a type of E. coli bacteria.\n\nIf you suspect your child has HUS, it's crucial to seek immediate medical attention. Here's what you can generally expect:\n\n1. Hospitalization: Your child will likely be hospitalized for close monitoring and treatment.\n\n2. Fluid and Electrolyte Balance: Intravenous (IV) fluids will be given to prevent dehydration and maintain the body's electrolyte balance.\n\n3. Blood Transfusion: If your child's anemia is severe, they may need a blood transfusion.\n\n4. Dialysis: If your child's kidneys are not working properly, they may need dialysis to filter waste from their blood.\n\n5. Plasma Exchange: In some cases, plasma exchange (also called plasmapheresis) may be used to remove harmful substances from the blood.\n\n6. Medication: Your child may be given medications to control high blood pressure, prevent blood clots, or treat any underlying infection.\n\n7. Nutrition: A special diet may be recommended to help manage the symptoms and support recovery.\n\nRemember, it's important to follow the advice of your child's healthcare provider. Each child's case is unique, and treatment may vary based on their specific needs and the severity of the condition.",
        "original_answer": "- Hemolytic uremic syndrome, or HUS, is a kidney condition that happens when red blood cells are destroyed and block the kidneys' filtering system.  - The most common cause of hemolytic uremic syndrome in children is an Escherichia coli (E. coli) infection of the digestive system.  - Normally, harmless strains, or types, of E. coli are found in the intestines and are an important part of digestion. However, if a child becomes infected with the O157:H7 strain of E. coli, the bacteria will lodge in the digestive tract and produce toxins that can enter the bloodstream.  - A child with hemolytic uremic syndrome may develop signs and symptoms similar to those seen with gastroenteritis, an inflammation of the lining of the stomach, small intestine, and large intestine.  - Most children who develop hemolytic uremic syndrome and its complications recover without permanent damage to their health.  - Some children may sustain significant kidney damage that slowly develops into chronic kidney disease (CKD).  - Parents and caregivers can help prevent childhood hemolytic uremic syndrome due to E. coli O157:H7 by      - avoiding unclean swimming areas    - avoiding unpasteurized milk, juice, and cider    - cleaning utensils and food surfaces often    - cooking meat to an internal temperature of at least 160 F    - defrosting meat in the microwave or refrigerator    - keeping children out of pools if they have had diarrhea    - keeping raw foods separate    - washing hands before eating    - washing hands well after using the restroom and after changing diapers",

        "original_answer": "The parathyroid glands are four pea-sized glands located on or near the thyroid gland in the neck. Occasionally, a person is born with one or more of the parathyroid glands in another location. For example, a gland may be embedded in the thyroid, in the thymusan immune system organ located in the chestor elsewhere around this area. In most such cases, however, the parathyroid glands function normally.\n                \nThe parathyroid glands are part of the bodys endocrine system. Endocrine glands produce, store, and release hormones, which travel in the bloodstream to target cells elsewhere in the body and direct the cells activity.\n                \nThough their names are similar, the thyroid and parathyroid glands are entirely different glands, each producing distinct hormones with specific functions. The parathyroid glands produce PTH, a hormone that helps maintain the correct balance of calcium in the body. PTH regulates the level of calcium in the blood, release of calcium from bone, absorption of calcium in the small intestine, and excretion of calcium in the urine.\n                \nWhen the level of calcium in the blood falls too low, normal parathyroid glands release just enough PTH to restore the blood calcium level.",

        "original_answer": "In about 80 percent of people with primary hyperparathyroidism, a benign, or noncancerous, tumor called an adenoma has formed in one of the parathyroid glands.2 The tumor causes the gland to become overactive. In most other cases, the excess hormone comes from two or more overactive parathyroid glands, a condition called multiple tumors or hyperplasia. Rarely, primary hyperparathyroidism is caused by cancer of a parathyroid gland.\n                \nIn most cases, health care providers dont know why adenoma or multiple tumors occur in the parathyroid glands. Most people with primary hyperparathyroidism have no family history of the disorder, but some cases can be linked to an inherited problem. For example, familial multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 is a rare, inherited syndrome that causes multiple tumors in the parathyroid glands as well as in the pancreas and the pituitary gland. Another rare genetic disorder, familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia, causes a kind of hyperparathyroidism that is atypical, in part because it does not respond to standard parathyroid surgery.",

        "original_answer": "Once the diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism is established, other tests may be done to assess complications:\n                \n- Bone mineral density test. Dual energy x-ray absorptiometry, sometimes called a DXA or DEXA scan, uses low-dose x rays to measure bone density. During the test, a person lies on a padded table while a technician moves the scanner over the persons body. DXA scans are performed in a health care providers office, outpatient center, or hospital by a specially trained technician and may be interpreted by a metabolic bone disease expert or radiologista doctor who specializes in medical imagingor other specialists; anesthesia is not needed. The test can help assess bone loss and risk of fractures.  - Ultrasound. Ultrasound uses a device, called a transducer, that bounces safe, painless sound waves off organs to create an image of their structure. The procedure is performed in a health care providers office, outpatient center, or hospital by a specially trained technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologist; anesthesia is not needed. The images can show the presence of kidney stones.  - Computerized tomography (CT) scan. CT scans use a combination of x rays and computer technology to create three-dimensional (3-D) images. A CT scan may include the injection of a special dye, called contrast medium. CT scans require the person to lie on a table that slides into a tunnel-shaped device where the x rays are taken. The procedure is performed in an outpatient center or hospital by an x-ray technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologist; anesthesia is not needed. CT scans can show the presence of kidney stones.  - Urine collection. A 24-hour urine collection may be done to measure selected chemicals, such as calcium and creatinine, which is a waste product healthy kidneys remove. The person collects urine over a 24-hour period, and the urine is sent to a laboratory for analysis. The urine collection may provide information on kidney damage, the risk of kidney stone formation, and the risk of familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia.  - 25-hydroxy-vitamin D blood test.

        "original_answer": "Surgery\n                \nSurgery to remove the overactive parathyroid gland or glands is the only definitive treatment for the disorder, particularly if the patient has a very high blood calcium level or has had a fracture or a kidney stone. In patients without any symptoms, guidelines are used to identify who might benefit from parathyroid surgery.3\n                \nWhen performed by experienced endocrine surgeons, surgery cures primary hyperparathyroidism in more than 95 percent of operations.2\n                \nSurgeons often use imaging tests before surgery to locate the overactive gland to be removed. The most commonly used tests are sestamibi and ultrasound scans. In a sestamibi scan, the patient receives an injection of a small amount of radioactive dye that is absorbed by overactive parathyroid glands. The overactive glands can then be viewed using a special camera.\n                \nSurgeons use two main strategies to remove the overactive gland or glands:\n                \n- Minimally invasive parathyroidectomy. This type of surgery, which can be done on an outpatient basis, may be used when only one of the parathyroid glands is likely to be overactive. Guided by a tumor-imaging test, the surgeon makes a small incision in the neck to remove the gland. The small incision means that patients typically have less pain and a quicker recovery than with more invasive surgery. Local or general anesthesia may be used for this type of surgery.  - Standard neck exploration. This type of surgery involves a larger incision that allows the surgeon to access and examine all four parathyroid glands and remove the overactive ones. This type of surgery is more extensive and typically requires a hospital stay of 1 to 2 days. Surgeons use this approach if they plan to inspect more than one gland. General anesthesia is used for this type of surgery.\n                \nAlmost all people with primary hyperparathyroidism who have symptoms can benefit from surgery. Experts believe that those without symptoms but who meet guidelines for surgery will also benefit from surgery. Surgery can lead to improved bone density and fewer fractures and can reduce the chance of forming kidney stones. Other potential benefits are being studied by researchers.\n                \nSurgery for primary hyperparathyroidism has a complication rate of 13 percent when performed by experienced endocrine surgeons.4 Rarely, patients undergoing surgery experience damage to the nerves controlling the vocal cords, which can affect speech. A small number of patients lose all their healthy parathyroid tissue and thus develop chronic low calcium levels, requiring lifelong treatment with calcium and some form of vitamin D. This complication is called hypoparathyroidism. The complication rate is slightly higher for operations on multiple tumors than for a single adenoma because more extensive surgery is needed.\n                \nPeople with primary hyperparathyroidism due to familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia should not have surgery.\n                \nMonitoring\n                \nSome people who have mild primary hyperparathyroidism may not need immediate or even any surgery and can be safely monitored. People may wish to talk with their health care provider about long-term monitoring if they\n                \n- are symptom-free  - have only slightly elevated blood calcium levels  - have normal kidneys and bone density\n                \nLong-term monitoring should include periodic clinical evaluations, annual serum calcium measurements, annual serum creatinine measurements to check kidney function, and bone density measurements every 1 to 2 years.\n                \nVitamin D deficiency should be corrected if present. Patients who are monitored need not restrict calcium in their diets.\n                \nIf the patient and health care provider choose long-term monitoring, the patient should\n                \n- drink plenty of water  - exercise regularly  - avoid certain diuretics, such as thiazides\n                \nEither immobilizationthe inability to move due to illness or injuryor gastrointestinal illness with vomiting or diarrhea that leads to dehydration can cause blood calcium levels to rise further in someone with primary hyperparathyroidism. People with primary hyperparathyroidism should seek medical attention if they find themselves immobilized or dehydrated due to vomiting or diarrhea.\n                \nMedications\n                \nCalcimimetics are a new class of medications that decrease parathyroid gland secretion of PTH. The calcimimetic, cinacalcet (Sensipar), has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism caused by dialysisa blood-filtering treatment for kidney failureand primary hyperparathyroidism caused by parathyroid cancer. Cinacalcet has also been approved for the management of hypercalcemia associated with primary hyperparathyroidism.\n                \nA number of other medications are being studied to learn whether they may be helpful in treating primary hyperparathyroidism.

        "original_answer": "- Primary hyperparathyroidism is a disorder of the parathyroid glands, in which one or more of the parathyroid glands are overactive. As a result, the gland releases too much parathyroid hormone (PTH).  - High PTH levels trigger the bones to release increased calcium into the blood, causing blood calcium levels to rise above normal. T he loss of calcium from bones may weaken the bones. In response to high blood calcium levels, the kidneys excrete more calcium in the urine, which can lead to kidney stones.  - Most people with primary hyperparathyroidism have no symptoms. When symptoms appear, they are often mild and nonspecific, such as muscle weakness, fatigue, increased need for sleep, feelings of depression, or aches and pains in bones and joints.  - People with more severe primary hyperparathyroidism may have symptoms such as loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, constipation, confusion or impaired thinking and memory, and increased thirst and urination.  - Health care providers diagnose primary hyperparathyroidism when a person has high blood calcium and PTH levels.  - Surgery to remove the overactive parathyroid gland or glands is the only definitive treatment for the disorder. When performed by experienced endocrine surgeons, surgery cures primary hyperparathyroidism in more than 95 percent of operations. Some people who have mild primary hyperparathyroidism may not need immediate or even any surgery and can be safely monitored. People with primary hyperparathyroidism due to familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia should not have surgery.",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "A urine blockage in newborns, also known as urethral obstruction, is a condition where urine cannot flow normally from the bladder through the urethra due to a blockage. This can cause the bladder to swell and, in severe cases, can lead to kidney damage. It is a serious condition that requires immediate medical attention.\n\nThere are different types of urethral obstructions, including:\n\n1. Posterior urethral valves: These are the most common type of urethral obstruction in boys and occur when there are abnormal flaps of tissue in the posterior (back) part of the urethra.\n2. Urethral stricture: This occurs when the urethra is too narrow, often due to scar tissue from an injury or infection.\n3. Ureterocele: This is a birth defect that affects the ureters (tubes that carry urine from the kidneys to the bladder). In some cases, a ureterocele can cause a blockage in the urethra.\n\nSymptoms of urine blockage in newborns can include a weak or absent urine stream, a swollen belly, and difficulty feeding. Treatment typically involves surgery to remove the blockage and allow urine to flow normally. If left untreated, urethral obstruction can lead to serious complications, including kidney failure.",
        "original_answer": "The urinary tract is the bodys drainage system for removing wastes and extra fluid. The urinary tract includes two kidneys, two ureters, a bladder, and a urethra. The kidneys are two bean-shaped organs, each about the size of a fist. They are located just below the rib cage, one on each side of the spine. Every day, the kidneys filter about 120 to 150 quarts of blood to produce about 1 to 2 quarts of urine, composed of wastes and extra fluid. Children produce less urine than adults. The amount produced depends on their age. The urine flows from the kidneys to the bladder through tubes called ureters. The bladder stores urine until releasing it through urination. When the bladder empties, urine flows out of the body through a tube called the urethra at the bottom of the bladder.\n                \nThe kidneys and urinary system keep fluids and natural chemicals in the body balanced. While a baby is developing in the mothers womb, called prenatal development, the placentaa temporary organ joining mother and babycontrols much of that balance. The babys kidneys begin to produce urine at about 10 to 12 weeks after conception. However, the mothers placenta continues to do most of the work until the last few weeks of the pregnancy. Wastes and extra water are removed from the babys body through the umbilical cord. The babys urine is released into the amniotic sac and becomes part of the amniotic fluid. This fluid plays a role in the babys lung development.",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Urine blockage in newborns, also known as ureteropelvic junction (UPJ) obstruction, can be caused by a congenital condition where the ureter (the tube that carries urine from the kidney to the bladder) is too narrow or has a malformation, leading to a partial or complete blockage. In some cases, it can also be caused by a blood vessel pressing on the ureter. It is important to seek medical attention if a newborn shows signs of a urine blockage, such as a distended belly, poor feeding, or vomiting.",
        "original_answer": "Many types of defects in the urinary tract can cause urine blockage:\n                \n- Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). Most children with VUR are born with a ureter that did not grow long enough during development in the womb. The valve formed by the ureter pressing against the bladder wall does not close properly, so urine backs uprefluxesfrom the bladder to the ureter and eventually to the kidney. Severe reflux may prevent a kidney from developing normally and may increase the risk for damage from infections after birth. VUR usually affects only one ureter and kidney, though it can affect both ureters and kidneys.  - Ureteropelvic junction (UPJ) obstruction. If urine is blocked where the ureter joins the kidney, only the kidney swells. The ureter remains a normal size. UPJ obstruction usually occurs in only one kidney.\n                \n- Bladder outlet obstruction (BOO). BOO describes any blockage in the urethra or at the opening of the bladder.Posterior urethral valves (PUV), the most common form of BOO seen in newborns and during prenatal ultrasound exams, is a birth defect in boys in which an abnormal fold of tissue in the urethra keeps urine from flowing freely out of the bladder. This defect may cause swelling in the entire urinary tract, including the urethra, bladder, ureters, and kidneys.  - Ureterocele. If the end of the ureter does not develop normally, it can bulge, creating a ureterocele. The ureterocele may obstruct part of the ureter or the bladder.\n                \nSome babies are born with genetic conditions that affect several different systems in the body, including the urinary tract:\n                \n- Prune belly syndrome (PBS). PBS is a group of birth defects involving poor development of the abdominal muscles, enlargement of the ureters and bladder, and both testicles remaining inside the body instead of descending into the scrotum. The skin over the abdomen is wrinkled, giving the appearance of a prune. PBS usually occurs in boys, and most children with PBS have hydronephrosisswelling in the kidneyand VUR.  - Esophageal atresia (EA). EA is a birth defect in which the esophagusthe muscular tube that carries food and liquids from the mouth to the stomachlacks the opening for food to pass into the stomach. Babies born with EA may also have problems with their spinal columns, digestive systems, hearts, and urinary tracts.  - Congenital heart defects. Heart defects range from mild to life threatening. Children born with heart defects also have a higher rate of problems in the urinary tract than children in the general population, suggesting that some types of heart and urinary defects may have a common genetic cause.\n                \nUrine blockage can also be caused by spina bifida and other birth defects that affect the spinal cord. These defects may interrupt nerve signals between the bladder, spinal cord, and brain, which are needed for urination, and lead to urinary retentionthe inability to empty the bladder completelyin newborns. Urine that remains in the bladder can reflux into the ureters and kidneys, causing swelling.",

Kidney damage or scarring: A severe or long-term blockage can lead to decreased kidney function, kidney scarring, or even kidney failure.\n\n2. Urinary tract infections (UTIs): The obstruction can cause urine to back up, increasing the risk of UTIs, which can lead to more severe complications if left untreated.\n\n3.

Hydronephrosis: This is a condition where urine collects in the kidney, causing it to swell. While it is not a complication itself, it can lead to kidney damage if not addressed.\n\n5. Reflux nephropathy: In some cases, the urine blockage can cause urine to flow backward into the kidney, leading to reflux nephropathy, which can cause kidney damage and high blood pressure.\n\nIt is essential to monitor and treat urine blockages in newborns to prevent these complications and ensure proper kidney function.",

The swelling may be easy to see or barely detectable. The results of hydronephrosis may be mild or severe, yet the long-term outcome for the childs health cannot always be predicted by the severity of swelling. Urine blockage may damage the developing kidneys and reduce their ability to filter. In the most severe cases of urine blockage, where little or no urine leaves the babys bladder, the amount of amniotic fluid is reduced to the point that the babys lung development is threatened.\n                \nAfter birth, urine blockage may raise a childs risk of developing a UTI.

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "A urine blockage in newborns, also known as ureteropelvic junction (UPJ) obstruction, is typically diagnosed through the following steps:\n\n1. Physical Examination: A healthcare provider will perform a physical exam to check for any visible abnormalities in the newborn's abdomen.\n2. Imaging Tests: If a physical exam suggests a urine blockage, the doctor may order imaging tests such as an ultrasound, VCUG (voiding cystourethrogram), or a MAG3 (mercaptoacetyltriglycine) scan to get a better look at the urinary tract and determine the location and severity of the blockage.\n3. Blood and Urine Tests: The doctor may also order blood and urine tests to check for any infections, kidney function abnormalities, or other underlying conditions that may be contributing to the blockage.\n\nIt is important to diagnose and treat urine blockages in newborns as soon as possible to prevent any potential damage to the kidneys. If you suspect your newborn may have a urine blockage, it is important to consult with a healthcare provider as soon as possible.",
        "original_answer": "Defects of the urinary tract may be diagnosed before or after the baby is born.\n                \nDiagnosis before Birth\n                \nTests during pregnancy can help determine if the baby is developing normally in the womb.\n                \n- Ultrasound. Ultrasound uses a device, called a transducer, that bounces safe, painless sound waves off organs to create an image of their structure. A prenatal ultrasound can show internal organs within the baby. The procedure is performed in a health care providers office, outpatient center, or hospital by a specially trained technician, and the images are interpreted by     - a radiologista doctor who specializes in medical imaging, or    - an obstetriciana doctor who delivers babies\n                \nThe images can show enlarged kidneys, ureters, or bladders in babies.\n                \n- Amniocentesis. Amniocentesis is a procedure in which amniotic fluid is removed from the mothers womb for testing. The procedure can be performed in the health care providers office, and local anesthetic may be used. The health care provider inserts a thin needle through the abdomen into the uterus to obtain a small amount of amniotic fluid. Cells from the fluid are grown in a lab and then analyzed. The health care provider usually uses ultrasound to find the exact location of the baby. The test can show whether the baby has certain birth defects and how well the babys lungs are developing.  - Chorionic villus sampling (CVS). CVS is the removal of a small piece of tissue from the placenta for testing. The procedure can be performed in the health care providers office; anesthesia is not needed. The health care provider uses ultrasound to guide a thin tube or needle through the vagina or abdomen into the placenta. Cells are removed from the placenta and then analyzed. The test can show whether the baby has certain genetic defects.\n                \nMost healthy women do not need all of these tests. Ultrasound exams during pregnancy are routine. Amniocentesis and CVS are recommended only when a risk of genetic problems exists because of family history or a problem is detected during an ultrasound. Amniocentesis and CVS carry a slight risk of harming the baby and mother or ending the pregnancy in miscarriage, so the risks should be carefully considered.\n                \nDiagnosis after Birth\n                \nDifferent imaging techniques can be used in infants and children to determine the cause of urine blockage.\n                \n- Ultrasound. Ultrasound can be used to view the childs urinary tract. For infants, the image is clearer than could be achieved while the baby was in the womb.  - Voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG). VCUG is an x-ray image of the bladder and urethra taken while the bladder is full and during urination, also called voiding. The procedure is performed in an outpatient center or hospital by an x-ray technician supervised by a radiologist, who then interprets the images. While anesthesia is not needed, sedation may be used for some children. The bladder and urethra are filled with a special dye, called contrast medium, to make the structures clearly visible on the x-ray images. The x-ray machine captures images of the contrast medium while the bladder is full and when the child urinates. The test can show reflux or blockage of the bladder due to an obstruction, such as PUV.  - Radionuclide scan. A radionuclide scan is an imaging technique that detects small amounts of radiation after a person is injected with radioactive chemicals. The dose of the radioactive chemicals is small; therefore, the risk of causing damage to cells is low. Radionuclide scans are performed in an outpatient center or hospital by a specially trained technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologist. Anesthesia is not needed. Special cameras and computers are used to create images of the radioactive chemicals as they pass through the kidneys. Radioactive chemicals injected into the blood can provide information about kidney function.",

Catheterization: A thin tube called a catheter is inserted into the urethra to drain the bladder and relieve the blockage.\n\n2. Medication: If the blockage is caused by a narrowing of the urethra, medication may be prescribed to relax the muscles and widen the opening.\n\n3. Surgery: If the blockage is severe or does not respond to other treatments, surgery may be necessary to remove the obstruction. This can include procedures to widen the urethra or create a new opening for urine to flow out of the body.\n\n4. Stent or Nephrostomy tube: If the blockage is severe and cannot be relieved by catheterization, a stent or nephrostomy tube may be placed to keep the urinary tract open and allow urine to drain.\n\n5. Follow-up care: Close monitoring and follow-up care are essential to ensure that the blockage does not recur and that any complications are promptly addressed. This may include regular ultrasounds, X-rays, or other imaging tests to monitor the urinary tract.",
        "original_answer": "Treatment for urine blockage depends on the cause and severity of the blockage. Hydronephrosis discovered before the baby is born rarely requires immediate action, especially if it is only on one side. The condition often goes away without any treatment before or after birth. The health care provider should keep track of the condition with frequent ultrasounds.\n                \nSurgery\n                \nIf the urine blockage threatens the life of the unborn baby, a fetal surgeon may recommend surgery to insert a shunt or correct the problem causing the blockage. A shunt is a small tube that can be inserted into the babys bladder to release urine into the amniotic sac. The procedure is similar to amniocentesis, in that a needle is inserted through the mothers abdomen. Ultrasound guides placement of the shunt, which is attached to the end of the needle. Alternatively, an endoscopea small, flexible tube with a lightcan be used to place a shunt or to repair the problem causing the blockage. Fetal surgery carries many risks, so it is performed only in special circumstances, such as when the amniotic fluid is absent and the babys lungs are not developing or when the kidneys are severely damaged.\n                \nIf the urinary defect does not correct itself after the child is born, and the child continues to have urine blockage, surgery may be needed to remove the obstruction and restore urine flow. The decision to operate depends on the degree of blockage. After surgery, a small tube, called a stent, may be placed in the ureter or urethra to keep it open temporarily while healing occurs.\n                \nAntibiotics\n                \nAntibiotics are bacteria-fighting medications. A child with possible urine blockage or VUR may be given antibiotics to prevent UTIs from developing until the urinary defect corrects itself or is corrected with surgery.\n                \nIntermittent Catheterization\n                \nIntermittent catheterization may be used for a child with urinary retention due to a nerve disease. The parent or guardian, and later the child, is taught to drain the bladder by inserting a thin tube, called a catheter, through the urethra to the bladder. Emptying the bladder in this way helps to decrease kidney damage, urine leakage, and UTIs.",

Symptoms can include a strong, persistent urge to urinate, a burning sensation when urinating, passing frequent, small amounts of urine, cloudy or strong-smelling urine, and pelvic pain in women. UTIs are typically treated with antibiotics.",
        "original_answer": "The urinary tract is the body's drainage system for removing wastes and extra water. The urinary tract includes two kidneys, two ureters, a bladder, and a urethra. The kidneys are a pair of bean-shaped organs, each about the size of a fist and located below the ribs, one on each side of the spine, toward the middle of the back. Every minute, a persons kidneys filter about 3 ounces of blood, removing wastes and extra water. The wastes and extra water make up the 1 to 2 quarts of urine a person produces each day. The urine travels from the kidneys down two narrow tubes called the ureters. The urine is then stored in a balloonlike organ called the bladder and emptied through the urethra, a tube at the bottom of the bladder.\n                \nWhen the bladder empties, a muscle called the sphincter relaxes and urine flows out of the body through the urethra. The opening of the urethra is at the end of the penis in males and in front of the vagina in females.",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "A urinary tract infection (UTI) in adults is usually caused by bacteria that enter the urinary tract through the urethra and begin to multiply in the bladder. The most common bacteria responsible is Escherichia coli (E. coli), which is found in the gut.\n\nCertain factors can increase the risk of developing a UTI, including:\n\n1. Female anatomy: Women have a shorter urethra than men, which allows bacteria to reach the bladder more easily.\n2. Sexual activity: Sexual intercourse can introduce bacteria into the urinary tract.\n3. Birth control: Use of spermicides or diaphragms for birth control can increase the risk of UTIs.\n4. Urinary tract abnormalities: Structural or functional abnormalities of the urinary tract can increase the risk of UTIs.\n5. Blockages in the urinary tract: Kidney stones or an enlarged prostate can trap urine in the bladder and increase the risk of infection.\n6. Catheter use: People who use catheters to urinate, such as those who are hospitalized or have certain medical conditions, are at increased risk of UTIs.\n7. Poor personal hygiene: Wiping from back to front after a bowel movement can introduce bacteria into the urethra.\n\nIf you suspect you have a UTI, it's important to see a healthcare provider for diagnosis and treatment to prevent complications.",
        "original_answer": "Most UTIs are caused by bacteria that live in the bowel. The bacterium Escherichia coli (E. coli) causes the vast majority of UTIs. Microbes called Chlamydia and Mycoplasma can infect the urethra and reproductive system but not the bladder. Chlamydia and Mycoplasma infections may be sexually transmitted and require treatment of sexual partners.\n                \nThe urinary tract has several systems to prevent infection. The points where the ureters attach to the bladder act like one-way valves to prevent urine from backing up toward the kidneys, and urination washes microbes out of the body. In men, the prostate gland produces secretions that slow bacterial growth. In both sexes, immune defenses also prevent infection. But despite these safeguards, infections still occur. Certain bacteria have a strong ability to attach themselves to the lining of the urinary tract.",

It's difficult to provide an exact number of people affected each year, but it's estimated that 150 million UTIs occur globally every year. In the United States, UTIs account for approximately 8.3 million doctor visits annually. However, these numbers include both adults and children. The prevalence in adults increases with age, particularly in women.",
        "original_answer": "Urinary tract infections are the second most common type of infection in the body, accounting for about 8.1 million visits to health care providers each year.1 Women are especially prone to UTIs for anatomical reasons. One factor is that a womans urethra is shorter, allowing bacteria quicker access to the bladder. Also, a womans urethral opening is near sources of bacteria from the anus and vagina. For women, the lifetime risk of having a UTI is greater than 50 percent.2 UTIs in men are not as common as in women but can be serious when they occur.",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "People at risk for urinary tract infections (UTIs) in adulthood include:\n\n1. Women: Women have a shorter urethra than men, which makes it easier for bacteria to reach the bladder and cause an infection.\n2. Sexual activity: Sexual intercourse can introduce bacteria into the urinary tract, increasing the risk of UTIs.\n3. Use of diaphragms or spermicides: These can increase the risk of UTIs in women.\n4. People with urinary tract abnormalities: Structural or functional abnormalities in the urinary tract can increase the risk of UTIs.\n5. People with suppressed immune systems: A weakened immune system can make it harder for the body to fight off infections.\n6. People with diabetes: People with diabetes have a higher risk of UTIs due to impaired immune function.\n7. Elderly individuals: Older adults, especially those in nursing homes or hospitals, are at increased risk due to decreased mobility and urinary tract abnormalities.\n\nPreventive measures, such as good hygiene, drinking plenty of fluids, and urinating after sexual intercourse, can help reduce the risk of UTIs. If you suspect you have a UTI, it's essential to consult a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment.",
        "original_answer": "Although everyone has some risk, some people are more prone to getting UTIs than others. People with spinal cord injuries or other nerve damage around the bladder have difficulty emptying their bladder completely, allowing bacteria to grow in the urine that stays in the bladder. Anyone with an abnormality of the urinary tract that obstructs the flow of urinea kidney stone or enlarged prostate, for exampleis at risk for a UTI. People with diabetes or problems with the bodys natural defense system are more likely to get UTIs.\n                \nSexual activity can move microbes from the bowel or vaginal cavity to the urethral opening. If these microbes have special characteristics that allow them to live in the urinary tract, it is harder for the body to remove them quickly enough to prevent infection. Following sexual intercourse, most women have a significant number of bacteria in their urine, but the body normally clears them within 24 hours. However, some forms of birth control increase the risk of UTI. In some women, certain spermicides may irritate the skin, increasing the risk of bacteria invading surrounding tissues. Using a diaphragm may slow urinary flow and allow bacteria to multiply. Condom use is also associated with increased risk of UTIs, possibly because of the increased trauma that occurs to the vagina during sexual activity. Using spermicides with diaphragms and condoms can increase risk even further.\n                \nAnother common source of infection is catheters, or tubes, placed in the urethra and bladder. Catheters interfere with the bodys ability to clear microbes from the urinary tract. Bacteria travel through or around the catheter and establish a place where they can thrive within the bladder. A person who cannot urinate in the normal way or who is unconscious or critically ill often needs a catheter for more than a few days. The Infectious Diseases Society of America recommends using catheters for the shortest time possible to reduce the risk of a UTI.3\n                \nRecurrent Infections\n                \nMany women suffer from frequent UTIs. About 20 percent of young women with a first UTI will have a recurrent infection.4 With each UTI, the risk that a woman will continue having recurrent UTIs increases.5 Some women have three or more UTIs a year. However, very few women will have frequent infections throughout their lives. More typically, a woman will have a period of 1 or 2 years with frequent infections, after which recurring infections cease.\n                \nMen are less likely than women to have a first UTI. But once a man has a UTI, he is likely to have another because bacteria can hide deep inside prostate tissue. Anyone who has diabetes or a problem that makes it hard to urinate may have repeat infections.\n                \nResearch funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) suggests that one factor behind recurrent UTIs may be the ability of bacteria to attach to cells lining the urinary tract. One NIH-funded study found that bacteria formed a protective film on the inner lining of the bladder in mice.6 If a similar process can be demonstrated in humans, the discovery may lead to new treatments to prevent recurrent UTIs. Another line of research has indicated that women who are nonsecretors of certain blood group antigens may be more prone to recurrent UTIs because the cells lining the vagina and urethra may allow bacteria to attach more easily. A nonsecretor is a person with an A, B, or AB blood type who does not secrete the normal antigens for that blood type in bodily fluids, such as fluids that line the bladder wall.7\n                \nInfections during Pregnancy\n                \nPregnant women seem no more prone to UTIs than other women. However, when a UTI does occur in a pregnant woman, it is more likely to travel to the kidneys. According to some reports, about 4 to 5 percent of pregnant women develop a UTI.8 Scientists think that hormonal changes and shifts in the position of the urinary tract during pregnancy make it easier for bacteria to travel up the ureters to the kidneys and cause infection. For this reason, health care providers routinely screen pregnant women for bacteria in the urine during the first 3 months of pregnancy.",

The amount of urine may be very small. Older women and men are more likely to be tired, shaky, and weak and have muscle aches and abdominal pain. Urine may look cloudy, dark, or bloody or have a foul smell. In a person with a catheter, the only symptom may be fever that cannot be attributed to any other cause. Normally, UTIs do not cause fever if they are in the bladder. A fever may mean the infection has reached the kidneys or has penetrated the prostate. Other symptoms of a kidney infection include pain in the back or side below the ribs, nausea, and vomiting.",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "A urinary tract infection (UTI) in adults can be diagnosed through a combination of symptoms and laboratory tests. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Medical history: The doctor will ask about any symptoms you are experiencing, such as a strong, persistent urge to urinate, a burning sensation when you urinate, passing frequent, small amounts of urine, or urine that looks cloudy or smells strong.\n2. Physical examination: A physical exam may be performed to check for tenderness in your lower abdomen or back, which can indicate a UTI.\n3. Urine test: A urine sample will be taken and analyzed in a laboratory to look for signs of infection, such as white blood cells, red blood cells, or bacteria.\n4. Urine culture: If the urine test suggests a UTI, a urine culture may be done to identify the specific type of bacteria causing the infection and to determine the most effective antibiotic to treat it.\n\nIt is important to consult a healthcare professional if you suspect a UTI, as untreated infections can lead to more serious complications.",
        "original_answer": "To find out whether a person has a UTI, the health care provider will ask about urinary symptoms and then test a sample of urine for the presence of bacteria and white blood cells, which are produced by the body to fight infection. Because bacteria can be found in the urine of healthy individuals, a UTI is diagnosed based both on symptoms and a laboratory test. The person will be asked to give a clean catch urine sample by washing the genital area and collecting a midstream sample of urine in a sterile container. This method of collecting urine helps prevent bacteria around the genital area from getting into the sample and confusing the test results. Usually, the sample is sent to a laboratory, although some health care providers offices are equipped to do the testing. For people with recurring infections and patients in the hospital, the urine may be cultured. The culture is performed by placing part of the urine sample in a tube or dish with a substance that encourages any bacteria present to grow. Once the bacteria have multiplied, which usually takes 1 to 3 days, they can be identified. The health care provider may also order a sensitivity test, which tests the bacteria for sensitivity to different antibiotics to see which medication is best for treating the infection.\n                \nIf a person has recurrent UTIs, the health care provider may order some additional tests to determine if the persons urinary tract is normal.\n                \nKidney and bladder ultrasound. Ultrasound uses a device, called a transducer, that bounces safe, painless sound waves off organs to create an image of their structure. The procedure is performed in a health care providers office, outpatient center, or hospital by a specially trained technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologista doctor who specializes in medical imaging; anesthesia is not needed. The images can show abnormalities in the kidneys and bladder. However, this test cannot reveal all important urinary abnormalities or measure how well the kidneys work.\n                \nVoiding cystourethrogram. This test is an x-ray image of the bladder and urethra taken while the bladder is full and during urination, also called voiding. As the person lies on the x-ray table, a health care provider inserts the tip of a thin, flexible tube called a catheter through the urethra into the bladder. The bladder and urethra are filled with a special dye called contrast medium, to make the structures clearly visible on the x-ray images. The x rays are taken from various angles while the bladder is full of contrast medium. The catheter is then removed and x-ray images are taken during urination. The procedure is performed in a health care providers office, outpatient center, or hospital by an x-ray technician. The technician is supervised by a radiologist while the images are taken. The radiologist then interprets the images. Anesthesia is not needed, but light sedation may be used for some people. This test can show abnormalities of the inside of the urethra and bladder. The test can also determine whether the flow of urine is normal when the bladder empties.\n                \nComputerized tomography (CT) scan. CT scans use a combination of x rays and computer technology to create three-dimensional (3-D) images. A CT scan may include the injection of contrast medium. CT scans require the person to lie on a table that slides into a tunnel-shaped device where the x rays are taken. The procedure is performed in an outpatient center or hospital by an x-ray technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologist; anesthesia is not needed. CT scans can provide clearer, more detailed images to help the health care provider understand the problem.\n                \nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI machines use radio waves and magnets to produce detailed pictures of the bodys internal organs and soft tissues without using x rays. An MRI may include an injection of contrast medium. With most MRI machines, the person lies on a table that slides into a tunnel-shaped device that may be open ended or closed at one end; some newer machines are designed to allow the person to lie in a more open space. The procedure is performed in an outpatient center or hospital by a specially trained technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologist; anesthesia is not needed though light sedation may be used for people with a fear of confined spaces. Like CT scans, MRIs can provide clearer, more detailed images.\n                \nRadionuclide scan. A radionuclide scan is an imaging technique that relies on the detection of small amounts of radiation after injection of radioactive chemicals. Because the dose of the radioactive chemicals is small, the risk of causing damage to cells is low. Special cameras and computers are used to create images of the radioactive chemicals as they pass through the kidneys. Radionuclide scans are performed in a health care providers office, outpatient center, or hospital by a specially trained technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologist; anesthesia is not needed. Radioactive chemicals injected into the blood can provide information about kidney function. Radioactive chemicals can also be put into the fluids used to fill the bladder and urethra for x ray, MRI, and CT imaging.\n                \nUrodynamics. Urodynamic testing is any procedure that looks at how well the bladder, sphincters, and urethra are storing and releasing urine. Most of these tests are performed in the office of a urologista doctor who specializes in urinary problemsby a urologist, physician assistant, or nurse practitioner. Some procedures may require light sedation to keep a person calm. Most urodynamic tests focus on the bladders ability to hold urine and empty steadily and completely. Urodynamic tests can also show whether the bladder is having abnormal contractions that cause leakage. A health care provider may order these tests if there is evidence that the person has some kind of nerve damage.\n                \nCystoscopy. Cystoscopy is a procedure that uses a tubelike instrument to look inside the urethra and bladder. Cystoscopy is performed by a doctor in a health care providers office, outpatient facility, or hospital with local anesthesia. However, in some cases, sedation and regional or general anesthesia are needed. Cystoscopy may be used to look for swelling, redness, and other signs of infection.",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "I'm an assistant and not a doctor, but I can certainly provide some general information about treating urinary tract infections (UTIs) in adults.\n\nUTIs are typically caused by bacteria and are usually treated with antibiotics. The type of antibiotic used and the length of the treatment may depend on the type of bacteria causing the infection and the patient's health condition. Common antibiotics used include trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim, Septra), fosfomycin (Monurol), nitrofurantoin (Macrobid), and ciprofloxacin (Cipro).\n\nIn addition to antibiotics, it's also recommended to drink plenty of water to help flush the bacteria out of the urinary system. Over-the-counter pain medications such as pyridium may also be used to relieve burning and pain during urination.\n\nIt's important to follow the full course of antibiotics as prescribed, even if symptoms improve before all the medication is gone. This can help prevent the infection from returning or becoming resistant to antibiotics.\n\nIf you suspect you have a UTI, it's important to consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan.",
        "original_answer": "Most UTIs are caused by bacteria, which are treated with bacteria-fighting medications called antibiotics or antimicrobials. The choice of medication and length of treatment depend on the patients history and the type of bacteria causing the infection. Some antibiotics may be ruled out if a person has allergies to them. The sensitivity test takes 48 hours to complete and is especially useful in helping the health care provider select the antibiotic most likely to be effective in treating an infection. Longer treatment may be needed if the first antibiotic given is not effective.\n                \nWhen a UTI occurs in a healthy person with a normal, unobstructed urinary tract, the term uncomplicated is used to describe the infection. Most young women who have UTIs have uncomplicated UTIs, which can be cured with 2 or 3 days of treatment. Single-dose treatment is less effective. Longer treatment causes more side effects and is not more effective. A follow-up urinalysis helps to confirm the urinary tract is infection-free. Taking the full course of treatment is important because symptoms may disappear before the infection is fully cleared.\n                \nComplicated UTIs occur when a personfor example, a pregnant woman or a transplant patientis weakened by another condition. A UTI is also complicated when the person has a structural or functional abnormality of the urinary tract, such as an obstructive kidney stone or prostate enlargement that squeezes the urethra. Health care providers should assume that men and boys have a complicated UTI until proven otherwise.\n                \nSeverely ill patients with kidney infections may be hospitalized until they can take fluids and needed medications on their own. Kidney infections may require several weeks of antibiotic treatment. Kidney infections in adults rarely lead to kidney damage or kidney failure unless they go untreated or are associated with urinary tract obstruction.\n                \nBladder infections are generally self-limiting, but antibiotic treatment significantly shortens the duration of symptoms. People usually feel better within a day or two of treatment. Symptoms of kidney and prostate infections last longer. Drinking lots of fluids and urinating frequently will speed healing. If needed, various medications are available to relieve the pain of a UTI. A heating pad on the back or abdomen may also help.\n                \nRecurrent Infections in Women\n                \nHealth care providers may advise women who have recurrent UTIs to try one of the following treatment options:\n                \n- Take low doses of the prescribed antibiotic daily for 6 months or longer. If taken at bedtime, the medication remains in the bladder longer and may be more effective. NIH-supported research has shown this therapy to be effective without causing serious side effects.  - Take a single dose of an antibiotic after sexual intercourse.  - Take a short course2 or 3 daysof an antibiotic when symptoms appear.\n                \nTo try to prevent an infection, health care providers may suggest women\n                \n- drink plenty of water every day  - urinate when the need arises and avoid resisting the urge to urinate  - urinate after sexual intercourse  - switch to a different method of birth control if recurring UTIs are a problem\n                \nInfections during Pregnancy\n                \nDuring pregnancy, bacterial infection of the urineeven in the absence of symptomscan pose risks to both the mother and the baby. Some antibiotics are not safe to take during pregnancy. In selecting the best treatments, health care providers consider various factors such as the medications effectiveness, the stage of pregnancy, the mothers health, and potential effects on the fetus.\n                \nComplicated Infections\n                \nCuring infections that stem from a urinary obstruction or other systemic disorder depends on finding and correcting the underlying problem, sometimes with surgery. If the root cause goes untreated, this group of patients is at risk for kidney damage. Also, such infections tend to arise from a wider range of bacteria and sometimes from more than one type of bacteria at a time.\n                \nInfections in Men\n                \nUrinary tract infections in men are often the result of an obstructionfor example, a urinary stone or enlarged prostateor are from a catheter used during a medical procedure. The first step in treating such an infection is to identify the infecting organism and the medications to which it is sensitive.\n                \nProstate infectionschronic bacterial prostatitisare harder to cure because antibiotics may be unable to penetrate infected prostate tissue effectively. For this reason, men with bacterial prostatitis often need long-term treatment with a carefully selected antibiotic. UTIs in men are frequently associated with acute bacterial prostatitis, which can be life threatening if not treated urgently.",

Water is best. Most people should try for six to eight, 8-ounce glasses a day. Talk with your health care provider if you cant drink the recommended amount due to other health problems, such as urinary incontinence, urinary frequency, or kidney failure.\n                \nUrination Habits\n                \nA person should urinate often and when the urge arises. Bacteria can grow when urine stays in the bladder too long. Women and men should urinate shortly after sex to flush away bacteria that might have entered the urethra during sex. Drinking a glass of water will also help flush bacteria away.\n                \nAfter using the toilet, women should wipe from front to back. This step is most important after a bowel movement to keep bacteria from getting into the urethra.\n                \nClothing\n                \nCotton underwear and loose-fitting clothes should be worn, so air can keep the area around the urethra dry.

A woman who has trouble with UTIs should try switching to a new form of birth control. Unlubricated condoms or spermicidal condoms increase irritation, which may help bacteria grow. Switching to lubricated condoms without spermicide or using a nonspermicidal lubricant may help prevent UTIs.",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "I'm a helpful assistant, not a doctor, but I can provide some general advice on what to do for a urinary tract infection (UTI) in adults. If you suspect you have a UTI, it's essential to consult a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and treatment. Here are some general steps to follow:\n\n1. Schedule an appointment with your doctor: Discuss your symptoms with your healthcare provider, who will likely order a urinalysis or urine culture to confirm the UTI and determine the appropriate antibiotic treatment.\n\n2. Take prescribed antibiotics: If your doctor diagnoses a UTI, they will prescribe antibiotics to kill the bacteria causing the infection. Be sure to take the full course of antibiotics as prescribed, even if symptoms improve.\n\n3. Stay hydrated: Drinking plenty of water can help flush bacteria from your urinary system and alleviate symptoms.\n\n4. Use a heating pad: Applying heat to the abdomen or back may help relieve pain and discomfort caused by a UTI.\n\n5. Over-the-counter pain relievers: Non-prescription medications like pyridium (phenazopyridine) can help alleviate pain and burning during urination. Consult your doctor or pharmacist for appropriate recommendations.\n\n6. Avoid irritants: Avoid caffeine, alcohol, spicy foods, and citrus juices, which can irritate your bladder and worsen UTI symptoms.\n\n7. Practice good hygiene: Wipe from front to back after using the restroom to prevent bacteria from entering the urethra.\n\n8. Empty your bladder frequently: Don't hold in urine, as this can increase the risk of UTIs.\n\n9. Wear breathable clothing: Tight-fitting, non-breathable clothing and underwear can trap moisture and promote bacterial growth. Opt for cotton underwear and loose-fitting clothing.\n\n10. Consider probiotics: Probiotics may help restore healthy bacteria in the urinary tract and vagina, potentially preventing future UTIs. Consult your healthcare provider for recommendations.\n\nRemember, it's essential to consult a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and treatment. This information is intended to be general advice and should not replace professional medical advice",
        "original_answer": "- Most urinary tract infections (UTIs) arise from one type of bacteria, Escherichia coli (E. coli), which normally lives in the bowel.  - Symptoms of a UTI in adults may include the following:      - a frequent and intense urge to urinate    - a painful, burning feeling in the bladder or urethra during urination    - feeling tired, shaky, and weak    - muscle aches    - abdominal pain    - only small amounts of urine passed, despite a strong urge to urinate    - cloudy, dark, or bloody urine or urine that has a foul smell    - pain in the back or side below the ribs    - nausea and vomiting    - Fever may indicate a kidney or prostate infection.  - Because bacteria can be found in the urine of healthy individuals, a UTI is diagnosed based both on symptoms and a laboratory test.  - UTIs are treated with bacteria-fighting medications called antibiotics or antimicrobials.",

It is also known as anemia of chronic disease.\n\nIn AICD, the body's immune system produces inflammatory proteins, such as cytokines, that interfere with the production of red blood cells in the bone marrow. This results in a decrease in the number of red blood cells, leading to anemia.\n\nAICD is commonly seen in patients with chronic conditions such as cancer, HIV, rheumatoid arthritis, kidney disease, and chronic infections. It can also occur in patients who have undergone surgery or experienced trauma.\n\nSymptoms of AICD may include fatigue, weakness, shortness of breath, and a pale appearance. Treatment of AICD involves addressing the underlying cause of the inflammation or chronic disease.

        "original_answer": "Anemia is a condition in which a person has a lower than normal number of red blood cells or the amount of hemoglobin in the red blood cells drops below normal, which prevents the bodys cells from getting enough oxygen. Hemoglobin is an iron-rich protein that gives blood its red color and lets red blood cells transport oxygen from the lungs to the bodys tissues. Therefore, low numbers of red blood cells or low levels of hemoglobin also cause low blood iron levels.\n                \nPeople with anemia may feel tired because their blood does not supply enough oxygen to the bodys organs and tissues. If anemia becomes severe and prolonged, the lack of oxygen in the blood can lead to shortness of breath or exercise intolerancea condition in which a person becomes easily fatigued during or after physical activityand eventually can cause the heart and other organs to fail.",

        "original_answer": "Anemia of inflammation and chronic disease is a type of anemia that commonly occurs with chronic, or long term, illnesses or infections. Cancer and inflammatory disorders, in which abnormal activation of the immune system occurs, can also cause AI/ACD.\n                \nAI/ACD is easily confused with iron-deficiency anemia because in both forms of anemia levels of iron circulating in the blood are low. Iron in the body is found both circulating in the blood and stored in body tissues. Circulating iron is necessary for red blood cell production. Low blood iron levels occur in iron-deficiency anemia because levels of the iron stored in the bodys tissues are depleted. In AI/ACD, however, iron stores are normal or high. Low blood iron levels occur in AI/ACD, despite normal iron stores, because inflammatory and chronic diseases interfere with the bodys ability to use stored iron and absorb iron from the diet. AI/ACD is the second most common form of anemia, after iron-deficiency anemia.1",

The underlying condition, such as chronic inflammation or disease, causes the body to produce cytokines, which are proteins that can interfere with the production of red blood cells or the normal functioning of hemoglobin.\n\nAdditionally, the chronic disease process can also cause an increase in the destruction of red blood cells or reduce the amount of iron available for red blood cell production. This can lead to a decrease in the number of red blood cells in the body, resulting in anemia.\n\nIt's important to note that AICD is not caused by a deficiency in dietary iron or other nutrients, but rather by the body's response to chronic inflammation or disease. Treating the underlying condition is the most effective way to address AICD.",
        "original_answer": "Anemia of inflammation and chronic disease is caused by red blood cells not functioning normally, so they cannot absorb and use iron efficiently. In addition, the body cannot respond normally to erythropoietin (EPO), a hormone made by the kidneys that stimulates bone marrow to produce red blood cells. Over time, this abnormal functioning causes a lower than normal number of red blood cells in the body.\n                \nSome of the chronic diseases that lead to AI/ACD include infectious and inflammatory diseases, kidney disease, and cancer. Certain treatments for chronic diseases may also impair red blood cell production and contribute to AI/ACD.\n                \nInfectious and inflammatory diseases. As part of the immune system response that occurs with infectious and inflammatory diseases, cells of the immune system release proteins called cytokines. Cytokines help heal the body and defend it against infection. However, they can also affect normal body functions. In AI/ACD, immune cytokines interfere with the bodys ability to absorb and use iron. Cytokines may also interfere with the production and normal activity of EPO.\n                \nInfectious diseases that cause AI/ACD include\n                \n- tuberculosis, an infection in the lungs  - HIV/AIDS, an infection that destroys the immune system  - endocarditis, an infection in the heart  - osteomyelitis, a bone infection\n                \nSometimes, acute infectionsthose that develop quickly and may not last longcan also cause AI/ACD.\n                \nInflammatory diseases that can lead to AI/ACD include\n                \n- rheumatoid arthritis, which causes pain, swelling, stiffness, and loss of function in the joints  - lupus, which causes damage to various body tissues, such as the joints, skin, kidneys, heart, lungs, blood vessels, and brain  - diabetes, in which levels of blood glucose, also called blood sugar, are above normal  - heart failure, in which the heart cannot pump enough blood to meet the bodys needs  - inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), diseases that cause inflammation and irritation in the intestines\n                \nIBD, including Crohns disease, can also cause iron deficiency due to poor absorption of iron by the diseased intestine and bleeding from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract.\n                \nKidney disease. People with kidney disease can develop anemia for several different reasons. Diseased kidneys often fail to make enough EPO. In addition, kidney disease results in abnormal absorption and use of iron, which is typical of AI/ACD. Anemia worsens as kidney disease advances. Therefore, most people with kidney failure have anemia. Kidney failure is described as end-stage kidney disease, sometimes called ESRD, when treated with a kidney transplant or blood-filtering treatments called dialysis.\n                \nPeople with kidney failure can also develop iron deficiency due to blood loss during hemodialysis, a type of dialysis that uses a special filter called a dialyzer to remove wastes from the blood. Low levels of iron and folic acidanother nutrient required for normal red blood cell productionmay also contribute to anemia in people with kidney disease.\n                \nCancer. AI/ACD can occur with certain types of cancer, including Hodgkins disease, non-Hodgkins lymphoma, and breast cancer. Like infectious and inflammatory diseases, these types of cancer cause inflammatory cytokines to be released in the body. Anemia can also be made worse by chemotherapy and radiation treatments that damage the bone marrow, and by the cancers invasion of bone marrow.",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Anemia of inflammation and chronic disease is typically diagnosed through a combination of medical history, physical examination, and laboratory tests.\n\nDuring the medical history, the doctor may ask about symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, shortness of breath, and pale skin, as well as any underlying medical conditions or chronic diseases.\n\nDuring the physical examination, the doctor may check for signs of anemia, such as a rapid heartbeat, pale skin, or unusual heart sounds.\n\nLaboratory tests are used to confirm the diagnosis and determine the severity of the anemia. These tests may include:\n\n1. Complete Blood Count (CBC): This test measures the number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets in the blood. A low red blood cell count is a common finding in anemia.\n2. Reticulocyte Count: This test measures the number of young red blood cells (reticulocytes) in the blood. A low reticulocyte count can indicate a problem with red blood cell production.\n3. Ferritin Test: Ferritin is a protein that stores iron in the body. A low ferritin level can indicate iron deficiency, which can cause anemia.\n4. Iron Saturation Test: This test measures the amount of iron in the blood. A low iron saturation level can indicate iron deficiency.\n5. C-reactive protein (CRP) and Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) tests: These tests measure inflammation in the body. Elevated levels can indicate anemia of inflammation and chronic disease.\n\nBased on the results of these tests, the doctor can determine if the anemia is caused by inflammation and chronic disease or by another underlying condition. It is important to note that other conditions, such as vitamin deficiencies or kidney disease, can also cause anemia, so further testing may be necessary to rule out these possibilities.",
        "original_answer": "To diagnose AI/ACD, a health care provider orders a blood test called a complete blood count (CBC). A blood test involves drawing a persons blood at a health care providers office or commercial facility and sending the sample to a lab for analysis. The CBC includes a measurement of a persons hematocrit, the percentage of the blood that consists of red blood cells. The CBC also measures the amount of hemoglobin in the blood and can show whether a person has a lower than normal number of red blood cells.\n                \nIn addition to measuring hematocrit and hemoglobin, the CBC includes two other measurements to show whether a person has enough iron:\n                \n- The ferritin level indicates the amount of iron stored in the body. A ferritin score below 200 nanograms per liter is a sign that a person may have an iron deficiency.  - The transferrin saturation (TSAT) is a score that indicates how much iron is available, or circulating, to make red blood cells. A TSAT score below 20 percent is another sign of iron deficiency.3\n                \nA CBC result that shows low iron levels in the blood yet normal measures of iron stores in the body is a hallmark of AI/ACD.",

However, AI/ACD is increasingly being viewed as a medical condition that merits direct treatment.\n                \nFor people with cancer or kidney disease who have low levels of EPO, a synthetic form of EPO may be prescribed. A health care provider usually injects EPO subcutaneouslyunder the skintwo or three times a week. A person may be taught how to inject the EPO at home. People on hemodialysis who cannot tolerate EPO shots may receive EPO intravenously during hemodialysis.\n                \nIf iron deficiency has a role in causing AI/ACD, a person may need iron supplements to raise hematocrit to a target level.

        "original_answer": "Autoimmune disorders cause most cases of Addisons disease. Infections and medications may also cause the disease.\n                \nAutoimmune Disorders\n                \nUp to 80 percent of Addisons disease cases are caused by an autoimmune disorder, which is when the bodys immune system attacks the bodys own cells and organs.2 In autoimmune Addisons, which mainly occurs in middle-aged females, the immune system gradually destroys the adrenal cortexthe outer layer of the adrenal glands.2\n                \nPrimary adrenal insufficiency occurs when at least 90 percent of the adrenal cortex has been destroyed.1 As a result, both cortisol and aldosterone are often lacking. Sometimes only the adrenal glands are affected. Sometimes other endocrine glands are affected as well, as in polyendocrine deficiency syndrome.\n                \nPolyendocrine deficiency syndrome is classified into type 1 and type 2. Type 1 is inherited and occurs in children. In addition to adrenal insufficiency, these children may have\n                \n- underactive parathyroid glands, which are four pea-sized glands located on or near the thyroid gland in the neck; they produce a hormone that helps maintain the correct balance of calcium in the body.   - slow sexual development.   - pernicious anemia, a severe type of anemia; anemia is a condition in which red blood cells are fewer than normal, which means less oxygen is carried to the bodys cells. With most types of anemia, red blood cells are smaller than normal; however, in pernicious anemia, the cells are bigger than normal.   - chronic fungal infections.   - chronic hepatitis, a liver disease.\n                \nResearchers think type 2, which is sometimes called Schmidts syndrome, is also inherited. Type 2 usually affects young adults and may include\n                \n- an underactive thyroid gland, which produces hormones that regulate metabolism   - slow sexual development   - diabetes, in which a person has high blood glucose, also called high blood sugar or hyperglycemia   - vitiligo, a loss of pigment on areas of the skin\n                \nInfections\n                \nTuberculosis (TB), an infection that can destroy the adrenal glands, accounts for 10 to 15 percent of Addisons disease cases in developed countries.1 When primary adrenal insufficiency was first identified by Dr. Thomas Addison in 1849, TB was the most common cause of the disease. As TB treatment improved, the incidence of Addisons disease due to TB of the adrenal glands greatly decreased. However, recent reports show an increase in Addisons disease from infections such as TB and cytomegalovirus. Cytomegalovirus is a common virus that does not cause symptoms in healthy people; however, it does affect babies in the womb and people who have a weakened immune systemmostly due to HIV/AIDS.2 Other bacterial infections, such as Neisseria meningitidis, which is a cause of meningitis, and fungal infections can also lead to Addisons disease.\n                \nOther Causes\n                \nLess common causes of Addisons disease are\n                \n- cancer cells in the adrenal glands   - amyloidosis, a serious, though rare, group of diseases that occurs when abnormal proteins, called amyloids, build up in the blood and are deposited in tissues and organs   - surgical removal of the adrenal glands   - bleeding into the adrenal glands   - genetic defects including abnormal adrenal gland development, an inability of the adrenal glands to respond to ACTH, or a defect in adrenal hormone production   - medication-related causes, such as from anti-fungal medications and the anesthetic etomidate, which may be used when a person undergoes an emergency intubationthe placement of a flexible, plastic tube through the mouth and into the trachea, or windpipe, to assist with breathing\n                \n\n                \n2",

        "original_answer": "A lack of CRH or ACTH causes secondary adrenal insufficiency. The lack of these hormones in the body can be traced to several possible sources.\n                \nStoppage of Corticosteroid Medication\n                \nA temporary form of secondary adrenal insufficiency may occur when a person who has been taking a synthetic glucocorticoid hormone, called a corticosteroid, for a long time stops taking the medication. Corticosteroids are often prescribed to treat inflammatory illnesses such as rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, and ulcerative colitis. In this case, the prescription doses often cause higher levels than those normally achieved by the glucocorticoid hormones created by the body. When a person takes corticosteroids for prolonged periods, the adrenal glands produce less of their natural hormones. Once the prescription doses of corticosteroid are stopped, the adrenal glands may be slow to restart their production of the bodys glucocorticoids. To give the adrenal glands time to regain function and prevent adrenal insufficiency, prescription corticosteroid doses should be reduced gradually over a period of weeks or even months. Even with gradual reduction, the adrenal glands might not begin to function normally for some time, so a person who has recently stopped taking prescription corticosteroids should be watched carefully for symptoms of secondary adrenal insufficiency.\n                \nSurgical Removal of Pituitary Tumors\n                \nAnother cause of secondary adrenal insufficiency is surgical removal of the usually noncancerous, ACTH-producing tumors of the pituitary gland that cause Cushings syndrome. Cushings syndrome is a hormonal disorder caused by prolonged exposure of the bodys tissues to high levels of the hormone cortisol. When the tumors are removed, the source of extra ACTH is suddenly gone and a replacement hormone must be taken until the bodys adrenal glands are able to resume their normal production of cortisol. The adrenal glands might not begin to function normally for some time, so a person who has had an ACTH-producing tumor removed and is going off of his or her prescription corticosteroid replacement hormone should be watched carefully for symptoms of adrenal insufficiency.\n                \nMore information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Cushings Syndrome.\n                \nChanges in the Pituitary Gland\n                \nLess commonly, secondary adrenal insufficiency occurs when the pituitary gland either decreases in size or stops producing ACTH. These events can result from\n                \n- tumors or an infection in the pituitary   - loss of blood flow to the pituitary   - radiation for the treatment of pituitary or nearby tumors   - surgical removal of parts of the hypothalamus   - surgical removal of the pituitary",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Adrenal insufficiency and Addison's disease are diagnosed through a combination of medical history, physical examination, and diagnostic tests.\n\nA healthcare provider will typically start by taking a medical history, asking about symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, weight loss, and gastrointestinal issues. They may also perform a physical examination to check for signs of adrenal insufficiency, such as low blood pressure, hyperpigmentation of the skin, and decreased muscle mass.\n\nDiagnostic tests are then used to confirm the diagnosis. These may include:\n\n1. Blood tests: These can measure levels of cortisol and other hormones produced by the adrenal glands. Low levels of cortisol may indicate adrenal insufficiency.\n2. ACTH stimulation test: This test measures the body's response to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), which stimulates the adrenal glands to produce cortisol. In this test, a healthcare provider will give a injection of synthetic ACTH and then measure cortisol levels in the blood at various intervals.\n3. CRH stimulation test: This test measures the body's response to corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), which stimulates the release of ACTH. In this test, a healthcare provider will give a injection of CRH and then measure ACTH and cortisol levels in the blood at various intervals.\n4. Imaging tests: Imaging tests such as a CT scan or MRI may be used to evaluate the size and shape of the adrenal glands and to look for other potential causes of symptoms.\n\nIf adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, further testing may be done to determine the cause. Primary adrenal insufficiency, such as Addison's disease, is caused by a problem with the adrenal glands themselves, while secondary adrenal insufficiency is caused by a problem with the pituitary gland or hypothalamus.",
        "original_answer": "In its early stages, adrenal insufficiency can be difficult to diagnose. A health care provider may suspect it after reviewing a persons medical history and symptoms.\n                \nA diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency is confirmed through hormonal blood and urine tests. A health care provider uses these tests first to determine whether cortisol levels are too low and then to establish the cause. Imaging studies of the adrenal and pituitary glands can be useful in helping to establish the cause.\n                \nA lab technician performs the following tests in a health care providers office, a commercial facility, or a hospital.\n                \nHormonal Blood and Urine Tests\n                \n- ACTH stimulation test. The ACTH stimulation test is the most commonly used test for diagnosing adrenal insufficiency. In this test, the patient is given an intravenous (IV) injection of synthetic ACTH, and samples of blood, urine, or both are taken before and after the injection. The cortisol levels in the blood and urine samples are measured in a lab. The normal response after an ACTH injection is a rise in blood and urine cortisol levels. People with Addisons disease or longstanding secondary adrenal insufficiency have little or no increase in cortisol levels.  Both low- and high-dose ACTH stimulation tests may be used depending on the suspected cause of adrenal insufficiency. For example, if secondary adrenal insufficiency is mild or has only recently occurred, the adrenal glands may still respond to ACTH because they have not yet shut down their own production of hormone. Some studies have suggested a low dose1 microgram (mcg)may be more effective in detecting secondary adrenal insufficiency because the low dose is still enough to raise cortisol levels in healthy people, yet not in people with mild or recent secondary adrenal insufficiency. However, recent research has shown that a significant proportion of healthy children and adults can fail the low-dose test, which may lead to unnecessary treatment. Therefore, some health care providers favor using a 250 mcg ACTH test for more accurate results.   - CRH stimulation test. When the response to the ACTH test is abnormal, a CRH stimulation test can help determine the cause of adrenal insufficiency. In this test, the patient is given an IV injection of synthetic CRH, and blood is taken before and 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes after the injection. The cortisol levels in the blood samples are measured in a lab. People with Addisons disease respond by producing high levels of ACTH, yet no cortisol. People with secondary adrenal insufficiency do not produce ACTH or have a delayed response. CRH will not stimulate ACTH secretion if the pituitary is damaged, so no ACTH response points to the pituitary as the cause. A delayed ACTH response points to the hypothalamus as the cause.\n                \nDiagnosis during Adrenal Crisis\n                \nAlthough a reliable diagnosis is not possible during adrenal crisis, measurement of blood ACTH and cortisol during the crisisbefore treatment with corticosteroids is givenis often enough to make a preliminary diagnosis. Low blood sodium, low blood glucose, and high blood potassium are also sometimes present at the time of adrenal crisis. Once the crisis is controlled, an ACTH stimulation test can be performed to help make a specific diagnosis. More complex lab tests are sometimes used if the diagnosis remains unclear.",

        "original_answer": "After Addisons disease is diagnosed, health care providers may use the following tests to look at the adrenal glands, find out whether the disease is related to TB, or identify antibodies associated with autoimmune Addisons disease.\n                \n- Ultrasound of the abdomen. Ultrasound uses a device, called a transducer, that bounces safe, painless sound waves off organs to create an image of their structure. A specially trained technician performs the procedure in a health care providers office, an outpatient center, or a hospital, and a radiologista doctor who specializes in medical imaginginterprets the images; a patient does not need anesthesia. The images can show abnormalities in the adrenal glands, such as enlargement or small size, nodules, or signs of calcium deposits, which may indicate bleeding.   - Tuberculin skin test. A tuberculin skin test measures how a patients immune system reacts to the bacteria that cause TB. A small needle is used to put some testing material, called tuberculin, under the skin. A nurse or lab technician performs the test in a health care providers office; a patient does not need anesthesia. In 2 to 3 days, the patient returns to the health care provider, who will check to see if the patient had a reaction to the test. The test can show if adrenal insufficiency could be related to TB.  To test whether a person has TB infection, which is when TB bacteria live in the body without making the person sick, a special TB blood test is used. To test whether a person has TB disease, which is when TB bacteria are actively attacking a persons lungs and making the person sick, other tests such as a chest x ray and a sample of sputumphlegm that is coughed up from deep in the lungsmay be needed.   - Antibody blood tests. A blood test involves drawing blood at a health care providers office or a commercial facility and sending the sample to a lab for analysis. The blood test can detect antibodiesproteins made by the immune system to protect the body from foreign substancesassociated with autoimmune Addisons disease.\n                \nAfter secondary adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, health care providers may use the following tests to obtain a detailed view of the pituitary gland and assess how it is functioning:\n                \n- Computerized tomography (CT) scan. CT scans use a combination of x rays and computer technology to create images. For a CT scan, the patient may be given a solution to drink and an injection of a special dye, called contrast medium. CT scans require the patient to lie on a table that slides into a tunnel-shaped device where the x rays are taken. An x-ray technician performs the procedure in an outpatient center or a hospital, and a radiologist interprets the images. The patient does not need anesthesia. A CT scan can show size and shape of the pituitary gland to find out if an abnormality is present.   - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI machines use radio waves and magnets to produce detailed pictures of the bodys internal organs and soft tissues without using x rays. An MRI may include the injection of contrast medium. With most MRI machines, the patient lies on a table that slides into a tunnel-shaped device that may be open ended or closed at one end; some machines are designed to allow the patient to lie in a more open space. A specially trained technician performs the procedure in an outpatient center or a hospital, and a radiologist interprets the images. The patient does not need anesthesia, though people with a fear of confined spaces may receive light sedation, taken by mouth. MRIs can be used to produce a three-dimensional (3-D) image of the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland to find out if an abnormality is present.   - Hormonal blood tests. Hormonal blood tests can assess how the pituitary gland is functioning and its ability to produce other hormones.",

People with secondary adrenal insufficiency normally maintain aldosterone production, so they do not require aldosterone replacement therapy.\n                \nDuring adrenal crisis, low blood pressure, low blood glucose, low blood sodium, and high blood levels of potassium can be life threatening. Standard therapy involves immediate IV injections of corticosteroids and large volumes of IV saline solution with dextrose, a type of sugar. This treatment usually brings rapid improvement. When the patient can take liquids and medications by mouth, the amount of corticosteroids is decreased until a dose that maintains normal hormone levels is reached. If aldosterone is deficient, the person will need to regularly take oral doses of fludrocortisone acetate.\n                \nResearchers have found that using replacement therapy for DHEA in adolescent girls who have secondary adrenal insufficiency and low levels of DHEA can improve pubic hair development and psychological stress.

        "original_answer": "- Adrenal insufficiency is an endocrine, or hormonal, disorder that occurs when the adrenal glands do not produce enough of certain hormones.   - Addisons disease, the common term for primary adrenal insufficiency, occurs when the adrenal glands are damaged and cannot produce enough of the adrenal hormone cortisol. The adrenal hormone aldosterone may also be lacking.   - Secondary adrenal insufficiency occurs when the pituitary gland fails to produce enough adrenocorticotropin (ACTH), a hormone that stimulates the adrenal glands to produce cortisol. If ACTH output is too low, cortisol production drops.   - The most common symptoms of adrenal insufficiency are chronic fatigue, muscle weakness, loss of appetite, weight loss, and abdominal pain. The slowly progressing symptoms are often ignored until a stressful event, such as surgery, a severe injury, an illness, or pregnancy, causes them to worsen.   - If not treated, an adrenal crisis can cause death.   - A diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency is confirmed through hormonal blood and urine tests. Imaging studies of the adrenal and pituitary glands can be useful in helping to establish the cause.   - Adrenal insufficiency is treated by replacing, or substituting, the hormones that the adrenal glands are not making.   - Problems can occur in people with adrenal insufficiency who are undergoing surgery, suffer a severe injury, have an illness, or are pregnant. These conditions place additional stress on the body, and people with adrenal insufficiency may need additional treatment to respond and recover.   - People with adrenal insufficiency should always carry identification stating their condition, adrenal insufficiency, in case of an emergency, as well as the supplies necessary to administer an emergency corticosteroid injection.",

A health care provider treats porphyria cutanea tarda by removing factors that tend to activate the disease and by performing repeated therapeutic phlebotomies to reduce iron in the liver. Therapeutic phlebotomy is the removal of about a pint of blood from a vein in the arm. A technician performs the procedure at a blood donation center, such as a hospital, clinic, or bloodmobile. A patient does not require anesthesia. Another treatment approach is low-dose hydroxychloroquine tablets to reduce porphyrins in the liver.  - Erythropoietic protoporphyria. People with erythropoietic protoporphyria may be given beta-carotene or cysteine to improve sunlight tolerance, though these medications do not lower porphyrin levels. Experts recommend hepatitis A and B vaccines and avoiding alcohol to prevent protoporphyric liver failure. A health care provider may use liver transplantation or a combination of medications to treat people who develop liver failure. Unfortunately, liver transplantation does not correct the primary defect, which is the continuous overproduction of protoporphyria by bone marrow. Successful bone marrow transplantations may successfully cure erythropoietic protoporphyria. A health care provider only considers bone marrow transplantation if the disease is severe and leading to secondary liver disease.  - Congenital erythropoietic porphyria and hepatoerythropoietic porphyria. People with congenital erythropoietic porphyria or hepatoerythropoietic porphyria may need surgery to remove the spleen or blood transfusions to treat anemia. A surgeon removes the spleen in a hospital, and a patient receives general anesthesia. With a blood transfusion, a patient receives blood through an intravenous (IV) line inserted into a vein. A technician performs the procedure at a blood donation center, and a patient does not need anesthesia.\n                \nSecondary Porphyrinurias\n                \nConditions called secondary porphyrinurias, such as disorders of the liver and bone marrow, as well as a number of drugs, chemicals, and toxins are often mistaken for porphyria because they lead to mild or moderate increases in porphyrin levels in the urine. Only highnot mild or moderatelevels of porphyrin or porphyrin precursors lead to a diagnosis of porphyria.",

        "original_answer": "- Porphyrias are rare disorders that affect mainly the skin or nervous system and may cause abdominal pain.  - Each of the eight types of porphyria corresponds to low levels of a specific enzyme in the heme biosynthetic pathway.  - The exact rates of porphyria are unknown and vary around the world. For example, porphyria cutanea tarda is most common in the United States, and variegate porphyria is most common in South America.  - Most porphyrias result from inheriting an abnormal gene, also called a gene mutation, from one parent.  - Porphyria cutanea tarda is usually an acquired disorder, meaning factors other than genes cause the enzyme deficiency.  - Symptoms of cutaneous porphyrias include      - oversensitivity to sunlight    - blisters on exposed areas of the skin    - itching and swelling on exposed areas of the skin    - Symptoms of acute porphyrias include      - pain in the abdomen    - pain in the chest, limbs, or back    - nausea and vomiting    - constipation    - urinary retention    - confusion    - hallucinations    - seizures and muscle weakness    - A health care provider diagnoses porphyria with blood, urine, and stool tests.  - Treatment for porphyria depends on the type of porphyria the person has and the severity of the symptoms.",

        "original_answer": "Too much sodium in a person's diet can be harmful because it causes blood to hold fluid. People with CKD need to be careful not to let too much fluid build up in their bodies. The extra fluid raises blood pressure and puts a strain on the heart and kidneys. A dietitian can help people find ways to reduce the amount of sodium in their diet. Nutrition labels provide information about the sodium content in food. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration advises that healthy people should limit their daily sodium intake to no more than 2,300 milligrams (mg), the amount found in 1 teaspoon of table salt. People who are at risk for a heart attack or stroke because of a condition such as high blood pressure or kidney disease should limit their daily sodium intake to no more than 1,500 mg. Choosing sodium-free or low-sodium food products will help them reach that goal.\n                \nSodium is found in ordinary table salt and many salty seasonings such as soy sauce and teriyaki sauce. Canned foods, some frozen foods, and most processed meats have large amounts of salt.

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Kidney failure is diagnosed through various tests, such as blood tests, urine tests, and imaging studies (like ultrasound or CT scan). If a patient has kidney failure, hemodialysis may be recommended as a treatment method.\n\nHemodialysis is a process where a machine filters waste and excess fluids from the blood, essentially performing the function of the kidneys. To diagnose if a patient is suitable for hemodialysis, the following factors are considered:\n\n1. Extent of kidney function loss: If the kidneys have lost more than 85% to 90% of their function, hemodialysis is often required.\n2. Presence of symptoms: Symptoms like swelling, shortness of breath, fatigue, and confusion can indicate the need for hemodialysis.\n3. Underlying health conditions: Comorbidities like diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart disease may require closer monitoring and earlier initiation of hemodialysis.\n4. Nutritional status: Adequate nutrition and hydration are essential for successful hemodialysis.\n5. Patient's preference: Ultimately, the patient's preference and lifestyle play a role in determining the most suitable treatment method.\n\nOnce a patient is diagnosed as a candidate for hemodialysis, they will undergo a vascular access procedure to create a connection between their blood vessels and the dialysis machine. This access point allows for efficient blood flow during hemodialysis treatments.",
        "original_answer": "About once a month, your dialysis care team will test your blood by using one of two formulasURR or Kt/Vto see whether your treatments are removing enough wastes. Both tests look at one specific waste product, called blood urea nitrogen (BUN), as an indicator for the overall level of waste products in your system.

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Hemodialysis is a common treatment for kidney failure. It involves using a machine to filter waste and excess fluids from your blood. Here are some treatment methods for hemodialysis:\n\n1. Regular Sessions: Hemodialysis is usually done three times a week, with each session lasting about 3-5 hours.\n\n2. Access to Bloodstream: A surgeon will create a vascular access, which is a way to reach your bloodstream. This can be a fistula (created by connecting an artery and vein in your arm), a graft (a synthetic tube that connects an artery and vein), or a catheter (a tube inserted into a vein in your neck or leg).\n\n3. Dialysis Solution: During hemodialysis, your blood is pumped through the dialyzer (artificial kidney) along with a dialysis solution, which is a fluid that has the same chemicals as your body fluids.\n\n4. Monitoring: Your vital signs, such as blood pressure and heart rate, will be monitored during the procedure.\n\n5. Diet and Fluid Restrictions: You may need to follow a special diet and limit your fluid intake to prevent your body from retaining too much fluid between sessions.\n\n6. Medications: You may need to take medications to control your blood pressure, prevent blood clots, and manage any other health conditions you have.\n\n7. Training: If you choose to do hemodialysis at home, you will need to be trained on how to do it safely and effectively.\n\n8. Transplant: Hemodialysis is not a cure for kidney failure, but it can help you feel better and live longer. Many people on hemodialysis are able to get a kidney transplant, which is a treatment that can replace the need for dialysis.",
        "original_answer": "Your kidneys do much more than remove wastes and extra fluid. They also make hormones and balance chemicals in your system. When your kidneys stop working, you may have problems with anemia and conditions that affect your bones, nerves, and skin. Some of the more common conditions caused by kidney failure are extreme tiredness, bone problems, joint problems, itching, and \"restless legs.\" Restless legs will keep you awake as you feel them twitching and jumping.\n                \nAnemia and Erythropoietin (EPO)\n                \nAnemia is a condition in which the volume of red blood cells is low. Red blood cells carry oxygen to cells throughout the body. Without oxygen, cells can't use the energy from food, so someone with anemia may tire easily and look pale. Anemia can also contribute to heart problems.\n                \nAnemia is common in people with kidney disease because the kidneys produce the hormone erythropoietin, or EPO, which stimulates the bone marrow to produce red blood cells. Diseased kidneys often don't make enough EPO, and so the bone marrow makes fewer red blood cells. EPO is available commercially and is commonly given to patients on dialysis.\n                \nFor more information about the causes of and treatments for anemia in kidney failure, see the NIDDK fact sheet Anemia in Chronic Kidney Disease.\n                \nRenal Osteodystrophy\n                \nThe term \"renal\" describes things related to the kidneys. Renal osteodystrophy, or bone disease of kidney failure, affects 90 percent of dialysis patients. It causes bones to become thin and weak or formed incorrectly and affects both children and adults. Symptoms can be seen in growing children with kidney disease even before they start dialysis. Older patients and women who have gone through menopause are at greater risk for this disease.\n                \nFor more information about the causes of this bone disease and its treatment in dialysis patients, see the NIDDK fact sheet Chronic Kidney Disease-Mineral and Bone Disorder.\n                \nItching (Pruritus)\n                \nMany people treated with hemodialysis complain of itchy skin, which is often worse during or just after treatment. Itching is common even in people who don't have kidney disease; in kidney failure, however, itching can be made worse by wastes in the bloodstream that current dialyzer membranes can't remove from the blood.\n                \nThe problem can also be related to high levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH). Some people have found dramatic relief after having their parathyroid glands removed. The four parathyroid glands sit on the outer surface of the thyroid gland, which is located on the windpipe in the base of your neck, just above the collarbone. The parathyroid glands help control the levels of calcium and phosphorus in the blood.\n                \nBut a cure for itching that works for everyone has not been found. Phosphate binders seem to help some people; these medications act like sponges to soak up, or bind, phosphorus while it is in the stomach. Others find relief after exposure to ultraviolet light. Still others improve with EPO shots. A few antihistamines (Benadryl, Atarax, Vistaril) have been found to help; also, capsaicin cream applied to the skin may relieve itching by deadening nerve impulses. In any case, taking care of dry skin is important. Applying creams with lanolin or camphor may help.\n                \nSleep Disorders\n                \nPatients on dialysis often have insomnia, and some people have a specific problem called the sleep apnea syndrome, which is often signaled by snoring and breaks in snoring. Episodes of apnea are actually breaks in breathing during sleep. Over time, these sleep disturbances can lead to \"day-night reversal\" (insomnia at night, sleepiness during the day), headache, depression, and decreased alertness. The apnea may be related to the effects of advanced kidney failure on the control of breathing. Treatments that work with people who have sleep apnea, whether they have kidney failure or not, include losing weight, changing sleeping position, and wearing a mask that gently pumps air continuously into the nose (nasal continuous positive airway pressure, or CPAP).\n                \nMany people on dialysis have trouble sleeping at night because of aching, uncomfortable, jittery, or \"restless\" legs. You may feel a strong impulse to kick or thrash your legs. Kicking may occur during sleep and disturb a bed partner throughout the night. The causes of restless legs may include nerve damage or chemical imbalances.\n                \nModerate exercise during the day may help, but exercising a few hours before bedtime can make it worse. People with restless leg syndrome should reduce or avoid caffeine, alcohol, and tobacco; some people also find relief with massages or warm baths. A class of drugs called benzodiazepines, often used to treat insomnia or anxiety, may help as well. These prescription drugs include Klonopin, Librium, Valium, and Halcion. A newer and sometimes more effective therapy is levodopa (Sinemet), a drug used to treat Parkinson's disease.\n                \nSleep disorders may seem unimportant, but they can impair your quality of life. Don't hesitate to raise these problems with your nurse, doctor, or social worker.\n                \nAmyloidosis\n                \nDialysis-related amyloidosis (DRA) is common in people who have been on dialysis for more than 5 years. DRA develops when proteins in the blood deposit on joints and tendons, causing pain, stiffness, and fluid in the joints, as is the case with arthritis. Working kidneys filter out these proteins, but dialysis filters are not as effective. For more information, see the NIDDK fact sheet Amyloidosis and Kidney Disease.",

A liver biopsy is often required to confirm the diagnosis and assess the severity of the disease.\n\nDuring a liver biopsy, a small sample of liver tissue is removed and examined under a microscope for signs of inflammation, scarring, and fat accumulation, which are indicative of NASH.\n\nIt is important to note that NASH can only be diagnosed by a healthcare professional, so if you suspect you may have this condition, it is important to seek medical attention.",
        "original_answer": "NASH is usually first suspected in a person who is found to have elevations in liver tests that are included in routine blood test panels, such as alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST). When further evaluation shows no apparent reason for liver disease (such as medications, viral hepatitis, or excessive use of alcohol) and when x rays or imaging studies of the liver show fat, NASH is suspected. The only means of proving a diagnosis of NASH and separating it from simple fatty liver is a liver biopsy. For a liver biopsy, a needle is inserted through the skin to remove a small piece of the liver. NASH is diagnosed when examination of the tissue with a microscope shows fat along with inflammation and damage to liver cells. If the tissue shows fat without inflammation and damage, simple fatty liver or NAFLD is diagnosed. An important piece of information learned from the biopsy is whether scar tissue has developed in the liver. Currently, no blood tests or scans can reliably provide this information.",

        "original_answer": "NASH is usually a silent disease with few or no symptoms. Patients generally feel well in the early stages and only begin to have symptomssuch as fatigue, weight loss, and weaknessonce the disease is more advanced or cirrhosis develops. The progression of NASH can take years, even decades. The process can stop and, in some cases, reverse on its own without specific therapy. Or NASH can slowly worsen, causing scarring or fibrosis to appear and accumulate in the liver. As fibrosis worsens, cirrhosis develops; the liver becomes seriously scarred, hardened, and unable to function normally. Not every person with NASH develops cirrhosis, but once serious scarring or cirrhosis is present, few treatments can halt the progression. A person with cirrhosis experiences fluid retention, muscle wasting, bleeding from the intestines, and liver failure. Liver transplantation is the only treatment for advanced cirrhosis with liver failure, and transplantation is increasingly performed in people with NASH. NASH ranks as one of the major causes of cirrhosis in America, behind hepatitis C and alcoholic liver disease.",

It is not caused by alcohol consumption, as the name suggests. Lifestyle factors such as a sedentary lifestyle, poor diet, and lack of exercise can also contribute to the development of NASH.",
        "original_answer": "Although NASH has become more common, its underlying cause is still not clear. It most often occurs in persons who are middle-aged and overweight or obese. Many patients with NASH have elevated blood lipids, such as cholesterol and triglycerides, and many have diabetes or prediabetes, but not every obese person or every patient with diabetes has NASH. Furthermore, some patients with NASH are not obese, do not have diabetes, and have normal blood cholesterol and lipids. NASH can occur without any apparent risk factor and can even occur in children. Thus, NASH is not simply obesity that affects the liver.\n                \nWhile the underlying reason for the liver injury that causes NASH is not known, several factors are possible candidates:\n                \n- insulin resistance  - release of toxic inflammatory proteins by fat cells (cytokines)  - oxidative stress (deterioration of cells) inside liver cells",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a type of fatty liver disease, and its treatment typically involves lifestyle modifications. These may include:\n\n1. Weight Loss: Losing weight through a healthy diet and regular exercise can help reduce liver fat and inflammation.\n\n2. Dietary Changes: A healthy diet that is low in processed foods, sugars, and unhealthy fats can help manage NASH.\n\n3. Regular Exercise: Engaging in regular physical activity can help with weight loss and overall health.\n\n4. Control of Other Health Conditions: Managing conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol can help prevent further liver damage.\n\nIn some cases, medication may be necessary. Currently, there are no FDA-approved medications for NASH, but several are being studied. These include:\n\n1. Vitamin E: This antioxidant may help reduce inflammation in the liver.\n\n2. Pioglitazone: This medication, used to treat diabetes, may also help improve insulin resistance and reduce liver fat.\n\n3. Obeticholic Acid: This medication, used to treat primary biliary cholangitis, is being studied for its potential to reduce liver inflammation and fibrosis in NASH.\n\n4. Other experimental medications: Several other medications are being studied for their potential to treat NASH.\n\nIt's important to note that lifestyle changes are the first line of treatment for NASH. If you have NASH, it's recommended that you work with a healthcare provider to develop a treatment plan that's right for you.",
        "original_answer": "Currently, no specific therapies for NASH exist. The most important recommendations given to persons with this disease are to\n                \n- reduce their weight (if obese or overweight)  - follow a balanced and healthy diet  - increase physical activity  - avoid alcohol  - avoid unnecessary medications\n                \nThese are standard recommendations, but they can make a difference. They are also helpful for other conditions, such as heart disease, diabetes, and high cholesterol.\n                \nA major attempt should be made to lower body weight into the healthy range. Weight loss can improve liver tests in patients with NASH and may reverse the disease to some extent. Research at present is focusing on how much weight loss improves the liver in patients with NASH and whether this improvement lasts over a period of time.\n                \nPeople with NASH often have other medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or elevated cholesterol. These conditions should be treated with medication and adequately controlled; having NASH or elevated liver enzymes should not lead people to avoid treating these other conditions.\n                \nExperimental approaches under evaluation in patients with NASH include antioxidants, such as vitamin E, selenium, and betaine. These medications act by reducing the oxidative stress that appears to increase inside the liver in patients with NASH. Whether these substances actually help treat the disease is not known, but the results of clinical trials should become available in the next few years.\n                \nAnother experimental approach to treating NASH is the use of newer antidiabetic medicationseven in persons without diabetes. Most patients with NASH have insulin resistance, meaning that the insulin normally present in the bloodstream is less effective for them in controlling blood glucose and fatty acids in the blood than it is for people who do not have NASH. The newer antidiabetic medications make the body more sensitive to insulin and may help reduce liver injury in patients with NASH. Studies of these medicationsincluding metformin, rosiglitazone, and pioglitazoneare being sponsored by the National Institutes of Health and should answer the question of whether these medications are beneficial in NASH.",

        "original_answer": "Signs and symptoms of Cushing's syndrome vary, but most people with the disorder have upper body obesity, a rounded face, increased fat around the neck, and relatively slender arms and legs. Children tend to be obese with slowed growth rates.\n                \nOther signs appear in the skin, which becomes fragile and thin, bruises easily, and heals poorly. Purple or pink stretch marks may appear on the abdomen, thighs, buttocks, arms, and breasts. The bones are weakened, and routine activities such as bending, lifting, or rising from a chair may lead to backaches and rib or spinal column fractures.\n                \nWomen with Cushing's syndrome usually have excess hair growth on their face, neck, chest, abdomen, and thighs. Their menstrual periods may become irregular or stop.

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Cushing's Syndrome is caused by prolonged exposure to high levels of the hormone cortisol. This can occur due to various reasons, such as:\n\n1. Taking glucocorticoid medications (like prednisone) for prolonged periods.\n2. The body producing too much cortisol, often due to a tumor in the pituitary gland, adrenal glands, or elsewhere in the body.\n\nIt's important to consult with a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment options.",
        "original_answer": "Cushing's syndrome occurs when the body's tissues are exposed to high levels of cortisol for too long. Many people develop Cushing's syndrome because they take glucocorticoids-steroid hormones that are chemically similar to naturally produced cortisolsuch as prednisone for asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and other inflammatory diseases. Glucocorticoids are also used to suppress the immune system after transplantation to keep the body from rejecting the new organ or tissue.\n                \nOther people develop Cushing's syndrome because their bodies produce too much cortisol. Normally, the production of cortisol follows a precise chain of events. First, the hypothalamus, a part of the brain about the size of a small sugar cube, sends corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) to the pituitary gland. CRH causes the pituitary to secrete adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH), which stimulates the adrenal glands. When the adrenals, which are located just above the kidneys, receive the ACTH, they respond by releasing cortisol into the bloodstream.\n                \nCortisol performs vital tasks in the body including\n                \n- helping maintain blood pressure and cardiovascular function  - reducing the immune system's inflammatory response  - balancing the effects of insulin, which breaks down glucose for energy  - regulating the metabolism of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats\n                \nOne of cortisol's most important jobs is to help the body respond to stress. For this reason, women in their last 3 months of pregnancy and highly trained athletes normally have high levels of the hormone. People suffering from depression, alcoholism, malnutrition, or panic disorders also have increased cortisol levels.\n                \nWhen the amount of cortisol in the blood is adequate, the hypothalamus and pituitary release less CRH and ACTH. This process ensures the amount of cortisol released by the adrenal glands is precisely balanced to meet the bodys daily needs. However, if something goes wrong with the adrenals or the regulating switches in the pituitary gland or hypothalamus, cortisol production can go awry.\n                \nPituitary Adenomas\n                \nPituitary adenomas cause 70 percent of Cushing's syndrome cases,1 excluding those caused by glucocorticoid use. These benign, or noncancerous, tumors of the pituitary gland secrete extra ACTH. Most people with the disorder have a single adenoma. This form of the syndrome, known as Cushing's disease, affects women five times more often than men.\n                \nEctopic ACTH Syndrome\n                \nSome benign or, more often, cancerous tumors that arise outside the pituitary can produce ACTH. This condition is known as ectopic ACTH syndrome. Lung tumors cause more than half of these cases, and men are affected three times more often than women. The most common forms of ACTH-producing tumors are small cell lung cancer, which accounts for about 13 percent of all lung cancer cases,2 and carcinoid tumors-small, slow-growing tumors that arise from hormone-producing cells in various parts of the body. Other less common types of tumors that can produce ACTH are thymomas, pancreatic islet cell tumors, and medullary carcinomas of the thyroid.\n                \nAdrenal Tumors\n                \nIn rare cases, an abnormality of the adrenal glands, most often an adrenal tumor, causes Cushing's syndrome. Adrenal tumors are four to five times more common in women than men, and the average age of onset is about 40. Most of these cases involve noncancerous tumors of adrenal tissue called adrenal adenomas, which release excess cortisol into the blood.\n                \nAdrenocortical carcinomas-adrenal cancers-are the least common cause of Cushing's syndrome. With adrenocortical carcinomas, cancer cells secrete excess levels of several adrenocortical hormones, including cortisol and adrenal androgens, a type of male hormone. Adrenocortical carcinomas usually cause very high hormone levels and rapid development of symptoms.\n                \nFamilial Cushing's Syndrome\n                \nMost cases of Cushing's syndrome are not inherited. Rarely, however, Cushing's syndrome results from an inherited tendency to develop tumors of one or more endocrine glands. Endocrine glands release hormones into the bloodstream. With primary pigmented micronodular adrenal disease, children or young adults develop small cortisol-producing tumors of the adrenal glands. With multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1), hormone-secreting tumors of the parathyroid glands, pancreas, and pituitary develop; Cushing's syndrome in MEN1 may be due to pituitary, ectopic, or adrenal tumors.",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Cushing's Syndrome is diagnosed through a series of tests that may include:\n\n1. Medical history and physical exam: Your doctor will review your symptoms, medical history, and any medications you're taking. They may also perform a physical exam to check for signs of Cushing's Syndrome.\n\n2. Urine and blood tests: These tests can measure the levels of cortisol and other hormones in your body. A 24-hour urine collection can provide a more accurate measurement of cortisol levels than a single blood test.\n\n3. Imaging tests: Your doctor may use imaging tests such as an MRI or CT scan to look for tumors in your pituitary gland or adrenal glands.\n\n4. Saliva cortisol test: This test measures the level of cortisol in your saliva. It's usually done at night, when cortisol levels are normally low.\n\n5. Dexamethasone suppression test: This test measures how your body responds to the administration of dexamethasone, a synthetic corticosteroid. Your doctor will give you a dose of dexamethasone and then measure your cortisol levels over the course of several days.\n\n6. CRH stimulation test: This test involves giving you a dose of CRH (corticotropin-releasing hormone) and then measuring your cortisol and ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone) levels.\n\nIf these tests suggest that you have Cushing's Syndrome, your doctor may recommend further testing to determine the cause of the condition. This may include additional imaging tests or biopsies.",
        "original_answer": "Diagnosis is based on a review of a person's medical history, a physical examination, and laboratory tests. X rays of the adrenal or pituitary glands can be useful in locating tumors.\n                \nTests to Diagnose Cushing's Syndrome\n                \nNo single lab test is perfect and usually several are needed. The three most common tests used to diagnose Cushing's syndrome are the 24-hour urinary free cortisol test, measurement of midnight plasma cortisol or late-night salivary cortisol, and the low-dose dexamethasone suppression test. Another test, the dexamethasone-corticotropin-releasing hormone test, may be needed to distinguish Cushing's syndrome from other causes of excess cortisol.\n                \n- 24-hour urinary free cortisol level. In this test, a person's urine is collected several times over a 24-hour period and tested for cortisol. Levels higher than 50 to 100 micrograms a day for an adult suggest Cushing's syndrome. The normal upper limit varies in different laboratories, depending on which measurement technique is used.  - Midnight plasma cortisol and late-night salivary cortisol measurements. The midnight plasma cortisol test measures cortisol concentrations in the blood. Cortisol production is normally suppressed at night, but in Cushing's syndrome, this suppression doesn't occur. If the cortisol level is more than 50 nanomoles per liter (nmol/L), Cushing's syndrome is suspected. The test generally requires a 48-hour hospital stay to avoid falsely elevated cortisol levels due to stress.   However, a late-night or bedtime saliva sample can be obtained at home, then tested to determine the cortisol level. Diagnostic ranges vary, depending on the measurement technique used.  - Low-dose dexamethasone suppression test (LDDST). In the LDDST, a person is given a low dose of dexamethasone, a synthetic glucocorticoid, by mouth every 6 hours for 2 days. Urine is collected before dexamethasone is administered and several times on each day of the test. A modified LDDST uses a onetime overnight dose.  Cortisol and other glucocorticoids signal the pituitary to release less ACTH, so the normal response after taking dexamethasone is a drop in blood and urine cortisol levels. If cortisol levels do not drop, Cushing's syndrome is suspected. The LDDST may not show a drop in cortisol levels in people with depression, alcoholism, high estrogen levels, acute illness, or stress, falsely indicating Cushing's syndrome. On the other hand, drugs such as phenytoin and phenobarbital may cause cortisol levels to drop, falsely indicating that Cushings is not present in people who actually have the syndrome. For this reason, physicians usually advise their patients to stop taking these drugs at least 1 week before the test.  - Dexamethasone-corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) test. Some people have high cortisol levels but do not develop the progressive effects of Cushing's syndrome, such as muscle weakness, fractures, and thinning of the skin. These people may have pseudo-Cushing's syndrome, a condition sometimes found in people who have depression or anxiety disorders, drink excess alcohol, have poorly controlled diabetes, or are severely obese. Pseudo-Cushings does not have the same long-term effects on health as Cushing's syndrome and does not require treatment directed at the endocrine glands.  The dexamethasone-CRH test rapidly distinguishes pseudo-Cushing's from mild cases of Cushing's. This test combines the LDDST and a CRH stimulation test. In the CRH stimulation test, an injection of CRH causes the pituitary to secrete ACTH. Pretreatment with dexamethasone prevents CRH from causing an increase in cortisol in people with pseudo-Cushing's. Elevations of cortisol during this test suggest Cushing's syndrome.\n                \nTests to Find the Cause of Cushing's Syndrome\n                \nOnce Cushing's syndrome has been diagnosed, other tests are used to find the exact location of the abnormality that leads to excess cortisol production. The choice of test depends, in part, on the preference of the endocrinologist or the center where the test is performed.\n                \n- CRH stimulation test. The CRH test, without pretreatment with dexamethasone, helps separate people with pituitary adenomas from those with ectopic ACTH syndrome or adrenal tumors. As a result of the CRH injection, people with pituitary adenomas usually experience a rise in blood levels of ACTH and cortisol because CRH acts directly on the pituitary. This response is rarely seen in people with ectopic ACTH syndrome and practically never in those with adrenal tumors.  - high-dose dexamethasone suppression test (HDDST). The HDDST is the same as the LDDST, except it uses higher doses of dexamethasone. This test helps separate people with excess production of ACTH due to pituitary adenomas from those with ectopic ACTH-producing tumors. High doses of dexamethasone usually suppress cortisol levels in people with pituitary adenomas but not in those with ectopic ACTH-producing tumors.  - Radiologic imaging: direct visualization of the endocrine glands. Imaging tests reveal the size and shape of the pituitary and adrenal glands and help determine if a tumor is present. The most common imaging tests are the computerized tomography (CT) scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A CT scan produces a series of x-ray pictures giving a cross-sectional image of a body part. MRI also produces images of internal organs but without exposing patients to ionizing radiation.  Imaging procedures are used to find a tumor after a diagnosis has been made. Imaging is not used to make the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome because benign tumors are commonly found in the pituitary and adrenal glands. These tumors, sometimes called incidentalomas, do not produce hormones in quantities that are harmful. They are not removed unless blood tests show they are a cause of symptoms or they are unusually large. Conversely, pituitary tumors may not be detectable by imaging in almost half of people who ultimately need pituitary surgery for Cushing's syndrome.  - Petrosal sinus sampling. This test is not always required, but in many cases, it is the best way to distinguish pituitary from ectopic causes of Cushing's syndrome. Samples of blood are drawn from the petrosal sinuses-veins that drain the pituitary-by inserting tiny tubes through a vein in the upper thigh or groin region. A local anesthetic and mild sedation are given, and x rays are taken to confirm the correct position of the tubes. Often CRH, the hormone that causes the pituitary to release ACTH, is given during this test to improve diagnostic accuracy.  Levels of ACTH in the petrosal sinuses are measured and compared with ACTH levels in a forearm vein. Higher levels of ACTH in the sinuses than in the forearm vein indicate a pituitary adenoma. Similar levels of ACTH in the petrosal sinuses and the forearm suggest ectopic ACTH syndrome.",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Cushing's syndrome is treated by addressing the underlying cause. If it's caused by a tumor, the treatment options include:\n\n1. Surgical removal of the tumor: This is the primary treatment for Cushing's syndrome caused by tumors in the pituitary gland, lungs, or other areas of the body.\n2. Radiation therapy: This may be used to shrink a tumor before or after surgery, or to treat tumors that can't be removed surgically.\n3. Medications: If surgery and radiation are not options, or if they do not work, medications may be used to control the production of cortisol.\n\nIf Cushing's syndrome is caused by long-term use of corticosteroid medications, the dosage may be reduced or the medication may be changed to a different type. However, this must be done carefully and under the supervision of a healthcare provider, as suddenly stopping corticosteroids can be dangerous.",
        "original_answer": "Treatment depends on the specific reason for excess cortisol and may include surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, or the use of cortisol-inhibiting drugs. If the cause is long-term use of glucocorticoid hormones to treat another disorder, the doctor will gradually reduce the dosage to the lowest dose adequate for control of that disorder. Once control is established, the daily dose of glucocorticoid hormones may be doubled and given on alternate days to lessen side effects. In some cases, noncorticosteroid drugs can be prescribed.\n                \nPituitary Adenomas\n                \nSeveral therapies are available to treat the ACTH-secreting pituitary adenomas of Cushing's disease. The most widely used treatment is surgical removal of the tumor, known as transsphenoidal adenomectomy. Using a special microscope and fine instruments, the surgeon approaches the pituitary gland through a nostril or an opening made below the upper lip. Because this procedure is extremely delicate, patients are often referred to centers specializing in this type of surgery. The success, or cure, rate of this procedure is more than 80 percent when performed by a surgeon with extensive experience. If surgery fails or only produces a temporary cure, surgery can be repeated, often with good results.\n                \nAfter curative pituitary surgery, the production of ACTH drops two levels below normal. This drop is natural and temporary, and patients are given a synthetic form of cortisol such as hydrocortisone or prednisone to compensate. Most people can stop this replacement therapy in less than 1 or 2 years, but some must be on it for life.\n                \nIf transsphenoidal surgery fails or a patient is not a suitable candidate for surgery, radiation therapy is another possible treatment. Radiation to the pituitary gland is given over a 6-week period, with improvement occurring in 40 to 50 percent of adults and up to 85 percent of children. Another technique, called stereotactic radiosurgery or gamma knife radiation, can be given in a single high-dose treatment. It may take several months or years before people feel better from radiation treatment alone. Combining radiation with cortisol-inhibiting drugs can help speed recovery.\n                \nDrugs used alone or in combination to control the production of excess cortisol are ketoconazole, mitotane, aminoglutethimide, and metyrapone. Each drug has its own side effects that doctors consider when prescribing medical therapy for individual patients.\n                \nEctopic ACTH Syndrome\n                \nTo cure the overproduction of cortisol caused by ectopic ACTH syndrome, all of the cancerous tissue that is secreting ACTH must be eliminated. The choice of cancer treatment-surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or a combination of these treatmentsdepends on the type of cancer and how far it has spread. Because ACTH-secreting tumors may be small or widespread at the time of diagnosis, making them difficult to locate and treat directly, cortisol-inhibiting drugs are an important part of treatment. In some cases, if other treatments fail, surgical removal of the adrenal glands, called bilateral adrenalectomy, may replace drug therapy.\n                \nAdrenal Tumors\n                \nSurgery is the mainstay of treatment for benign and cancerous tumors of the adrenal glands. Primary pigmented micronodular adrenal disease and the inherited Carney complex-primary tumors of the heart that can lead to endocrine overactivity and Cushing's syndrome-require surgical removal of the adrenal glands.",

In some cases, medication to control cortisol levels may be necessary. It's important to consult with a healthcare provider for an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan.",
        "original_answer": "- Cushing's syndrome is a disorder caused by prolonged exposure of the body's tissues to high levels of the hormone cortisol.  - Typical signs and symptoms of Cushing's syndrome include upper body obesity, a rounded face, skin that bruises easily and heals poorly, weakened bones, excess body hair growth and menstrual irregularities in women, and decreased fertility in men.  - Cushing's syndrome is caused by exposure to glucocorticoids, which are used to treat inflammatory diseases, or by the body's overproduction of cortisol, most often due to tumors of the pituitary gland or lung.  - Several tests are usually needed to diagnosis Cushing's syndrome, including urine, blood, and saliva tests. Other tests help find the cause of the syndrome.  - Treatment depends on the specific reason for excess cortisol and may include surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, or the use of cortisol-inhibiting drugs.",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Hematuria, or blood in the urine, can be diagnosed through the following steps:\n\n1. Medical history: The doctor will ask about any symptoms, medical conditions, family history, and medication use.\n2. Physical examination: A general physical exam may reveal signs of underlying conditions that can cause hematuria.\n3. Urinalysis: A urine sample will be tested for red blood cells, white blood cells, and other substances that can indicate the presence of infection, kidney stones, or other issues.\n4. Imaging tests: Depending on the results of the urinalysis, the doctor may order imaging tests such as ultrasound, CT scan, or MRI to get a better look at the urinary tract and identify any abnormalities.\n5. Cystoscopy: In some cases, the doctor may perform a cystoscopy, a procedure that involves inserting a thin tube with a camera into the bladder, to get a closer look at the bladder lining and urethra.\n\nIt is important to note that in some cases, hematuria may not have an underlying cause and may resolve on its own. However, it is important to seek medical attention to rule out any serious underlying conditions.",
        "original_answer": "Hematuria is diagnosed with urinalysis, which is testing of a urine sample. The urine sample is collected in a special container in a health care providers office or commercial facility and can be tested in the same location or sent to a lab for analysis. For the test, a nurse or technician places a strip of chemically treated paper, called a dipstick, into the urine. Patches on the dipstick change color when RBCs are present in urine. When blood is visible in the urine or a dipstick test of the urine indicates the presence of RBCs, a health care provider examines the urine with a microscope to make an initial diagnosis of hematuria. The next step is to diagnose the cause of the hematuria.\n                \nThe health care provider will take a thorough medical history. If the history suggests a cause that does not require treatment, the urine should be tested again after 48 hours for the presence of RBCs. If two of three urine samples show too many RBCs when viewed with a microscope, more serious causes should be explored. The health care provider may order one or more of the following tests:\n                \n- Urinalysis. Further testing of the urine may be done to check for problems that can cause hematuria, such as infection, kidney disease, and cancer. The presence of white blood cells signals a UTI. RBCs that are misshapen or clumped together to form little tubes, called casts, may indicate kidney disease. Large amounts of protein in the urine, called proteinuria, may also indicate kidney disease. The urine can also be tested for the presence of cancer cells.  - Blood test. A blood test involves drawing blood at a health care providers office or commercial facility and sending the sample to a lab for analysis. A blood test can show the presence of high levels of creatinine, a waste product of normal muscle breakdown, which may indicate kidney disease.  - Biopsy. A biopsy is a procedure that involves taking a piece of kidney tissue for examination with a microscope. The biopsyis performed by a health care provider in a hospital with light sedation and local anesthetic. The health care provider uses imaging techniques such as ultrasound or a computerized tomography (CT) scan to guide the biopsy needle into the kidney. The kidney tissue is examined in a lab by a pathologista doctor who specializes in diagnosing diseases. The test helps diagnose the type of kidney disease causing hematuria.  - Cystoscopy. Cystoscopy is a procedure that uses a tubelike instrument to look inside the urethra and bladder. Cystoscopy is performed by a health care provider in the office, an outpatient facility, or a hospital with local anesthesia. However, in some cases, sedation and regional or general anesthesia are needed. Cystoscopy may be used to look for cancer cells in the bladder, particularly if cancer cells are found with urinalysis. More information is provided in the NIDDK health topic,Cystoscopy and Ureteroscopy.   - Kidney imaging tests. Intravenous pyelogram (IVP) is an x ray of the urinary tract. A special dye, called contrast medium, is injected into a vein in the persons arm, travels through the body to the kidneys, and makes urine visible on the x ray. The contrast medium also shows any blockage in the urinary tract. When a small mass is found with IVP, another imaging test, such as an ultrasound, CT scan, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), can be used to further study the mass. Imaging tests are performed in an outpatient center or hospital by a specially trained technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologista doctor who specializes in medical imaging. Anesthesia is not needed, though light sedation may be used in some cases. Imaging tests may show a tumor, a kidney or bladder stone, an enlarged prostate, or other blockage of the normal flow of urine. More information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Imaging of the Urinary Tract.",

The kidneys are a pair of bean-shaped organs, each about the size of a fist and located below the ribs, one on each side of the spine, toward the middle of the back. Every minute, a persons kidneys filter about 3 ounces of blood, removing wastes and extra water. The wastes and extra water make up the 1 to 2 quarts of urine an adult produces each day. Children produce less urine each day; the amount produced depends on their age. The urine travels from the kidneys down two narrow tubes called the ureters. The urine is then stored in a balloonlike organ called the bladder. Routinely, urine drains in only one directionfrom the kidneys to the bladder. The bladder fills with urine until it is full enough to signal the need to urinate. In children, the bladder can hold about 2 ounces of urine plus 1 ounce for each year of age. For example, an 8-year-olds bladder can hold about 10 ounces of urine.\n                \nWhen the bladder empties, a muscle called the sphincter relaxes and urine flows out of the body through a tube called the urethra at the bottom of the bladder. The opening of the urethra is at the end of the penis in boys and in front of the vagina in girls.",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Urinary tract infections (UTIs) in children are usually caused by bacteria that enter the urinary tract, often through the urethra. The bacteria can come from the skin around the genitals or from feces that contain bacteria, which can get on the skin and enter the urethra.\n\nIn children, UTIs are most commonly caused by the bacterium Escherichia coli (E. coli), which is found in the gut and in feces. Less commonly, other bacteria or, rarely, viruses or fungi can cause UTIs.\n\nCertain factors can increase a child's risk of developing a UTI, including:\n- Being female: Girls have a shorter urethra than boys, which makes it easier for bacteria to reach the bladder.\n- Being uncircumcised: Uncircumcised boys have a higher risk of UTIs during the first year of life.\n- Using a catheter: Children who need a catheter to urinate, such as those with spinal cord injuries or other conditions that make it difficult to urinate, are at higher risk of UTIs.\n- Abnormalities in the urinary tract: Structural or functional abnormalities in the urinary tract, such as vesicoureteral reflux or obstruction, can increase the risk of UTIs.\n- Poor personal hygiene: Not cleaning the genital area properly can increase the risk of UTIs.\n- Constipation: Constipation can increase the risk of UTIs in children.\n\nIf you suspect your child has a UTI, it's important to seek medical attention promptly to prevent complications. UTIs can usually be treated effectively with antibiotics.",
        "original_answer": "Most UTIs are caused by bacteria that live in the bowel. The bacterium Escherichia coli (E. coli) causes the vast majority of UTIs. The urinary tract has several systems to prevent infection. The points where the ureters attach to the bladder act like one-way valves to prevent urine from backing up, or refluxing, toward the kidneys, and urination washes microbes out of the body. Immune defenses also prevent infection. But despite these safeguards, infections still occur. Certain bacteria have a strong ability to attach themselves to the lining of the urinary tract.\n                \nChildren who often delay urination are more likely to develop UTIs. Regular urination helps keep the urinary tract sterile by flushing away bacteria. Holding in urine allows bacteria to grow. Producing too little urine because of inadequate fluid intake can also increase the risk of developing a UTI. Chronic constipationa condition in which a child has fewer than two bowel movements a weekcan add to the risk of developing a UTI. When the bowel is full of hard stool, it presses against the bladder and bladder neck, blocking the flow of urine and allowing bacteria to grow.\n                \nSome children develop UTIs because they are prone to such infections, just as other children are prone to getting coughs, colds, or ear infections.",

        "original_answer": "Symptoms of a UTI range from slight burning with urination or unusual-smelling urine to severe pain and high fever. A child with a UTI may also have no symptoms. A UTI causes irritation of the lining of the bladder, urethra, ureters, and kidneys, just as the inside of the nose or the throat becomes irritated with a cold. In infants or children who are only a few years old, the signs of a UTI may not be clear because children that young cannot express exactly how they feel. Children may have a high fever, be irritable, or not eat.\n                \nOn the other hand, children may have only a low-grade fever; experience nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea; or just not seem healthy. Children who have a high fever and appear sick for more than a day without signs of a runny nose or other obvious cause for discomfort should be checked for a UTI.\n                \nOlder children with UTIs may complain of pain in the middle and lower abdomen. They may urinate often. Crying or complaining that it hurts to urinate and producing only a few drops of urine at a time are other signs of a UTI. Children may leak urine into clothing or bedsheets. The urine may look cloudy or bloody. If a kidney is infected, children may complain of pain in the back or side below the ribs.\n                \nParents should talk with their health care provider if they suspect their child has a UTI.",

        "original_answer": "Only a health care provider can determine whether a child has a UTI.\n                \nA urine sample will be collected and examined. The way urine is collected depends on the childs age:\n                \n- If the child is not yet toilet trained, the health care provider may place a plastic collection bag over the childs genital area. The bag will be sealed to the skin with an adhesive strip. If this method is used, the bag should be removed right after the child has urinated, and the urine sample should be processed immediately. Because bacteria from the skin can contaminate this sample, the methods listed below are more accurate.  - A health care provider may need to pass a small tube called a catheter into the urethra of an infant. Urine will drain directly from the bladder into a clean container.  - Sometimes the best way to collect a urine sample from an infant is by placing a needle directly into the bladder through the skin of the lower abdomen. Getting urine through a catheter or needle will ensure that the urine collected does not contain bacteria from the skin.  - An older child may be asked to urinate into a container. The sample needs to come as directly into the container as possible to avoid picking up bacteria from the skin or rectal area.\n                \nSome of the urine will be examined with a microscope. If an infection is present, bacteria and sometimes pus will be found in the urine. A urine culture should also be performed on some of the urine. The culture is performed by placing part of the urine sample in a tube or dish with a substance that encourages any bacteria present to grow. Once the bacteria have multiplied, which usually takes 1 to 3 days, they can be identified.\n                \nThe reliability of the culture depends on how the urine is collected and how long the urine stands before the culture is started. If the urine sample is collected at home, it should be refrigerated as soon as it is collected. The container should be carried to the health care provider or lab in a plastic bag filled with ice.\n                \nThe health care provider may also order a sensitivity test, which tests the bacteria for sensitivity to different antibiotics to see which medication is best for treating the infection.",

This can be done by encouraging the child to drink plenty of water.\n\nIf the UTI is severe or there are complications, such as kidney involvement, the child may need to be hospitalized for treatment and monitoring.\n\nIt's important to note that if a child experiences frequent UTIs, further testing may be needed to determine if there is an underlying condition, such as vesicoureteral reflux or an obstruction in the urinary tract, that needs to be addressed.",
        "original_answer": "Most UTIs are caused by bacteria, which are treated with bacteria-fighting medications called antibiotics or antimicrobials. While a urine sample is sent to a laboratory, the health care provider may begin treatment with an antibiotic that treats the bacteria most likely to be causing the infection. Once culture results are known, the health care provider may decide to switch the childs antibiotic.\n                \nThe choice of medication and length of treatment depend on the childs history and the type of bacteria causing the infection. When a child is sick or unable to drink fluids, the antibiotic may need to be put directly into the bloodstream through a vein in the arm or hand or be given as an injection. Otherwise, the medicationliquid or pillsmay be given by mouth. The medication is given for at least 3 to 5 days and possibly for as long as several weeks. The daily treatment schedule recommended depends on the specific medication prescribed: The schedule may call for a single dose each day or up to four doses each day. In some cases, a child will need to take the medication until further tests are finished.\n                \nAfter a few doses of the antibiotic, a child may appear much better, but often several days may pass before all symptoms are gone. In any case, the medication should be taken for as long as the health care provider recommends. Medications should not be stopped because the symptoms have gone away. Infections may return, and bacteria can resist future treatment if the medication is stopped too soon.\n                \nIf needed, the health care provider may recommend an appropriate over-the-counter medication to relieve the pain of a UTI.

        "original_answer": "Once the infection has cleared, more tests may be recommended to check for abnormalities in the urinary tract. Repeated infections in an abnormal urinary tract may cause kidney damage. The kinds of tests ordered will depend on the child and the type of urinary infection. Because no single test can tell everything about the urinary tract that might be important, more than one of the tests listed below may be needed.\n                \n- Kidney and bladder ultrasound. Ultrasound uses a device, called a transducer, that bounces safe, painless sound waves off organs to create an image of their structure. The procedure is performed in a health care providers office, outpatient center, or hospital by a specially trained technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologista doctor who specializes in medical imaging; anesthesia is not needed. The images can show certain abnormalities in the kidneys and bladder. However, this test cannot reveal all important urinary abnormalities or measure how well the kidneys work.  - Voiding cystourethrogram. This test is an x-ray image of the bladder and urethra taken while the bladder is full and during urination, also called voiding. The childs bladder and urethra are filled with a special dye, called contrast medium, to make the structures clearly visible on the x-ray images. The x-ray machine captures images of the contrast medium while the bladder is full and when the child urinates. The procedure is performed in a health care providers office, outpatient center, or hospital by an x-ray technician supervised by a radiologist, who then interprets the images. Anesthesia is not needed, but sedation may be used for some children. This test can show abnormalities of the inside of the urethra and bladder. The test can also determine whether the flow of urine is normal when the bladder empties.  - Computerized tomography (CT) scan. CT scans use a combination of x rays and computer technology to create three-dimensional (3-D) images. A CT scan may include the injection of contrast medium. CT scans require the child to lie on a table that slides into a tunnel-shaped device where the x rays are taken. The procedure is performed in an outpatient center or hospital by an x-ray technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologist; anesthesia is not needed. CT scans can provide clearer, more detailed images to help the health care provider understand the problem.  - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI machines use radio waves and magnets to produce detailed pictures of the bodys internal organs and soft tissues without using x rays. An MRI may include the injection of contrast medium. With most MRI machines, the child lies on a table that slides into a tunnel-shaped device that may be open ended or closed at one end; some newer machines are designed to allow the child to lie in a more open space. The procedure is performed in an outpatient center or hospital by a specially trained technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologist; anesthesia is not needed, though light sedation may be used for children with a fear of confined spaces. Like CT scans, MRIs can provide clearer, more detailed images.  - Radionuclide scan. A radionuclide scan is an imaging technique that relies on the detection of small amounts of radiation after injection of radioactive chemicals. Because the dose of the radioactive chemicals is small, the risk of causing damage to cells is low. Special cameras and computers are used to create images of the radioactive chemicals as they pass through the kidneys. Radionuclide scans are performed in a health care providers office, outpatient center, or hospital by a specially trained technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologist; anesthesia is not needed. Radioactive chemicals injected into the blood can provide information about kidney function. Radioactive chemicals can also be put into the fluids used to fill the bladder and urethra for x ray, MRI, and CT imaging. Radionuclide scans expose a child to about the same amount or less of radiation as a conventional x ray.  - Urodynamics. Urodynamic testing is any procedure that looks at how well the bladder, sphincters, and urethra are storing and releasing urine. Most of these tests are performed in the office of a urologista doctor who specializes in urinary problemsby a urologist, physician assistant, or nurse practitioner. Some procedures may require light sedation to keep the child calm. Most urodynamic tests focus on the bladders ability to hold urine and empty steadily and completely. Urodynamic tests can also show whether the bladder is having abnormal contractions that cause leakage. A health care provider may order these tests if there is evidence that the child has some kind of nerve damage or dysfunctional voidingunhealthy urination habits such as holding in urine when the bladder is full.",

        "original_answer": "Some abnormalities in the urinary tract correct themselves as the child grows, but some may require surgical correction. While milder forms of VUR may resolve on their own, one common procedure to correct VUR is the reimplantation of the ureters. During this procedure, the surgeon repositions the connection between the ureters and the bladder so that urine will not reflux into the ureters and kidneys. This procedure may be performed through an incision that gives the surgeon a direct view of the bladder and ureters or laparoscopically. Laparoscopy is a procedure that uses a scope inserted through a small incision.\n                \nIn recent years, health care providers have treated some cases of VUR by injecting substances into the bladder wall, just below the opening where the ureter joins the bladder. This injection creates a kind of narrowing or valve that keeps urine from refluxing into the ureters. The injection is delivered to the inside of the bladder through a catheter passed through the urethra, so there is no surgical incision. Evidence of clinically significant obstruction may indicate the need for surgery.",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "I'm a helpful assistant, not a doctor, but I can provide some general advice on what to do for urinary tract infections (UTIs) in children. If you suspect your child has a UTI, it's essential to consult a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and treatment.\n\nHere are some general steps to follow:\n\n1. Recognize the symptoms: Common symptoms of UTIs in children include frequent urination, pain or burning during urination, strong-smelling or cloudy urine, and lower abdominal pain or discomfort. In infants and toddlers, symptoms might include fever, fussiness, or poor appetite.\n\n2. Consult a healthcare professional: If you suspect a UTI, contact your child's healthcare provider. They will likely request a urine sample to confirm the infection and determine the appropriate antibiotic treatment based on the type of bacteria causing the infection.\n\n3. Encourage hydration: Encourage your child to drink plenty of fluids, such as water and cranberry juice, to help flush bacteria from the urinary tract.\n\n4. Pain relief: Over-the-counter pain medications, such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen, can help alleviate pain and discomfort associated with UTIs. Follow the recommended dosage for your child's age and weight.\n\n5. Follow-up care: Ensure your child completes the full course of prescribed antibiotics, even if symptoms improve. Schedule a follow-up appointment with your healthcare provider to ensure the infection has been resolved.\n\n6. Prevent recurring UTIs: Encourage good hygiene practices, such as wiping from front to back after using the toilet, and teach your child to empty their bladder completely during urination. For girls, recommend wearing cotton underwear and avoiding tight-fitting clothing to maintain good airflow and reduce the risk of bacteria growth.\n\nRemember, it's essential to consult a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and treatment.",
        "original_answer": "- Urinary tract infections (UTIs) usually occur when the body fails to remove bacteria rapidly from the urinary tract.  - UTIs affect about 3 percent of children in the United States every year.  - Most UTIs are not serious, but chronic kidney infections can cause permanent damage.  - A UTI in a young child may be a sign of an abnormality in the urinary tract that could lead to repeated problems.  - Symptoms of a UTI range from slight burning with urination or unusual-smelling urine to severe pain and high fever. A child with a UTI may also have no symptoms.  - Parents should talk with their health care provider if they suspect their child has a UTI.",

        "original_answer": "The urinary tract is the bodys drainage system for removing urine, which is composed of wastes and extra fluid. In order for normal urination to occur, all parts in the urinary tract need to work together in the correct order.\n                \nKidneys. The kidneys are two bean-shaped organs, each about the size of a fist. They are located just below the rib cage, one on each side of the spine. Every day, the kidneys filter about 120 to 150 quarts of blood to produce about 1 to 2 quarts of urine. The kidneys work around the clock; a person does not control what they do.\n                \nUreters. Ureters are the thin tubes of muscleone on each side of the bladderthat carry urine from each of the kidneys to the bladder.\n                \nBladder. The bladder, located in the pelvis between the pelvic bones, is a hollow, muscular, balloon-shaped organ that expands as it fills with urine. Although a person does not control kidney function, a person does control when the bladder empties. Bladder emptying is known as urination. The bladder stores urine until the person finds an appropriate time and place to urinate. A normal bladder acts like a reservoir and can hold 1.5 to 2 cups of urine. How often a person needs to urinate depends on how quickly the kidneys produce the urine that fills the bladder. The muscles of the bladder wall remain relaxed while the bladder fills with urine. As the bladder fills to capacity, signals sent to the brain tell a person to find a toilet soon. During urination, the bladder empties through the urethra, located at the bottom of the bladder.\n                \nThree sets of muscles work together like a dam, keeping urine in the bladder between trips to the bathroom.\n                \nThe first set is the muscles of the urethra itself. The area where the urethra joins the bladder is the bladder neck. The bladder neck, composed of the second set of muscles known as the internal sphincter, helps urine stay in the bladder. The third set of muscles is the pelvic floor muscles, also referred to as the external sphincter, which surround and support the urethra.\n                \nTo urinate, the brain signals the muscular bladder wall to tighten, squeezing urine out of the bladder. At the same time, the brain signals the sphincters to relax. As the sphincters relax, urine exits the bladder through the urethra.",

        "original_answer": "Urinary incontinence in men results when the brain does not properly signal the bladder, the sphincters do not squeeze strongly enough, or both. The bladder muscle may contract too much or not enough because of a problem with the muscle itself or the nerves controlling the bladder muscle. Damage to the sphincter muscles themselves or the nerves controlling these muscles can result in poor sphincter function. These problems can range from simple to complex.\n                \nA man may have factors that increase his chances of developing UI, including\n                \n- birth defectsproblems with development of the urinary tract  - a history of prostate cancersurgery or radiation treatment for prostate cancer can lead to temporary or permanent UI in men\n                \nUI is not a disease. Instead, it can be a symptom of certain conditions or the result of particular events during a mans life. Conditions or events that may increase a mans chance of developing UI include\n                \n- benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)a condition in which the prostate is enlarged yet not cancerous. In men with BPH, the enlarged prostate presses against and pinches the urethra. The bladder wall becomes thicker. Eventually, the bladder may weaken and lose the ability to empty, leaving some urine in the bladder. The narrowing of the urethra and incomplete emptying of the bladder can lead to UI.  - chronic coughinglong-lasting coughing increases pressure on the bladder and pelvic floor muscles.  - neurological problemsmen with diseases or conditions that affect the brain and spine may have trouble controlling urination.  - physical inactivitydecreased activity can increase a mans weight and contribute to muscle weakness.  - obesityextra weight can put pressure on the bladder, causing a need to urinate before the bladder is full.  - older agebladder muscles can weaken over time, leading to a decrease in the bladders capacity to store urine.\n                \nMore information is provided in the NIDDK health topics, Nerve Disease and Bladder Control and Prostate Enlargement: Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia.",

        "original_answer": "The types of UI in men include\n                \n- urgency incontinence  - stress incontinence  - functional incontinence  - overflow incontinence  - transient incontinence\n                \nUrgency Incontinence\n                \nUrgency incontinence happens when a man urinates involuntarily after he has a strong desire, or urgency, to urinate. Involuntary bladder contractions are a common cause of urgency incontinence. Abnormal nerve signals might cause these bladder contractions.\n                \nTriggers for men with urgency incontinence include drinking a small amount of water, touching water, hearing running water, or being in a cold environmenteven if for just a short whilesuch as reaching into the freezer at the grocery store. Anxiety or certain liquids, medications, or medical conditions can make urgency incontinence worse.\n                \nThe following conditions can damage the spinal cord, brain, bladder nerves, or sphincter nerves, or can cause involuntary bladder contractions leading to urgency incontinence:\n                \n- Alzheimers diseasea disorder that affects the parts of the brain that control thought, memory, and language  - injury to the brain or spinal cord that interrupts nerve signals to and from the bladder  - multiple sclerosisa disease that damages the material that surrounds and protects nerve cells, which slows down or blocks messages between the brain and the body  - Parkinsons diseasea disease in which the cells that make a chemical that controls muscle movement are damaged or destroyed  - strokea condition in which a blocked or ruptured artery in the brain or neck cuts off blood flow to part of the brain and leads to weakness, paralysis, or problems with speech, vision, or brain function\n                \nUrgency incontinence is a key sign of overactive bladder. Overactive bladder occurs when abnormal nerves send signals to the bladder at the wrong time, causing its muscles to squeeze without enough warning time to get to the toilet. More information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Nerve Disease and Bladder Control.\n                \nStress Incontinence\n                \nStress incontinence results from movements that put pressure on the bladder and cause urine leakage, such as coughing, sneezing, laughing, or physical activity. In men, stress incontinence may also occur\n                \n- after prostate surgery  - after neurologic injury to the brain or spinal cord  - after trauma, such as injury to the urinary tract  - during older age\n                \nFunctional Incontinence\n                \nFunctional incontinence occurs when physical disability, external obstacles, or problems in thinking or communicating keep a person from reaching a place to urinate in time. For example, a man with Alzheimers disease may not plan ahead for a timely trip to a toilet. A man in a wheelchair may have difficulty getting to a toilet in time. Arthritispain and swelling of the jointscan make it hard for a man to walk to the restroom quickly or open his pants in time.\n                \nOverflow Incontinence\n                \nWhen the bladder doesnt empty properly, urine spills over, causing overflow incontinence. Weak bladder muscles or a blocked urethra can cause this type of incontinence. Nerve damage from diabetes or other diseases can lead to weak bladder muscles; tumors and urinary stones can block the urethra. Men with overflow incontinence may have to urinate often, yet they release only small amounts of urine or constantly dribble urine.\n                \nTransient Incontinence\n                \nTransient incontinence is UI that lasts a short time. Transient incontinence is usually a side effect of certain medications, drugs, or temporary conditions, such as\n                \n- a urinary tract infection (UTI), which can irritate the bladder and cause strong urges to urinate  - caffeine or alcohol consumption, which can cause rapid filling of the bladder  - chronic coughing, which can put pressure on the bladder  - constipationhard stool in the rectum can put pressure on the bladder  - blood pressure medications that can cause increased urine production  - short-term mental impairment that reduces a mans ability to care for himself  - short-term restricted mobility",

Two to 11 percent of older men report daily UI.1 Although more women than men develop UI, the chances of a man developing UI increase with age because he is more likely to develop prostate problems as he ages. Men are also less likely to speak with a health care professional about UI, so UI in men is probably far more common than statistics show. Having a discussion with a health care professional about UI is the first step to fixing this treatable problem.",

Medical history: The doctor will ask about symptoms, medical history, and any medications being taken.\n2. Physical exam: A physical exam can help identify any underlying conditions that may be causing incontinence.\n3. Urinalysis: A urinalysis can detect urinary tract infections, kidney stones, or other conditions that may be causing incontinence.\n4. Post-void residual measurement: This test measures the amount of urine left in the bladder after urination, which can help determine if there is a blockage.\n5. Urodynamic testing: This test measures bladder pressure and urine flow rate to determine if the bladder is storing and releasing urine properly.\n6. Cystoscopy: A cystoscopy is a procedure that allows the doctor to see inside the bladder and urethra using a thin, lighted tube.\n7. Imaging tests: Imaging tests such as ultrasound, CT scan, or MRI may be used to get a more detailed view of the urinary tract.\n\nBased on the results of these tests, the doctor can make a diagnosis and recommend appropriate treatment options.",
        "original_answer": "Men should tell a health care professional, such as a family practice physician, a nurse, an internist, or a urologista doctor who specializes in urinary problemsthey have UI, even if they feel embarrassed. To diagnose UI, the health care professional will\n                \n- take a medical history  - conduct a physical exam  - order diagnostic tests\n                \nMedical History\n                \nTaking a medical history can help a health care professional diagnose UI. He or she will ask the patient or caretaker to provide a medical history, a review of symptoms, a description of eating habits, and a list of prescription and over-the-counter medications the patient is taking. The health care professional will ask about current and past medical conditions.\n                \nThe health care professional also will ask about the mans pattern of urination and urine leakage. To prepare for the visit with the health care professional, a man may want to keep a bladder diary for several days beforehand. Information that a man should record in a bladder diary includes\n                \n- the amount and type of liquid he drinks  - how many times he urinates each day and how much urine is released  - how often he has accidental leaks  - whether he felt a strong urge to go before leaking  - what he was doing when the leak occurred, for example, coughing or lifting  - how long the symptoms have been occurring\n                \nUse the Daily Bladder Diary to prepare for the appointment.\n                \nThe health care professional also may ask about other lower urinary tract symptoms that may indicate a prostate problem, such as\n                \n- problems starting a urine stream  - problems emptying the bladder completely  - spraying urine  - dribbling urine  - weak stream  - recurrent UTIs  - painful urination\n                \nPhysical Exam\n                \nA physical exam may help diagnose UI. The health care professional will perform a physical exam to look for signs of medical conditions that may cause UI. The health care professional may order further neurologic testing if necessary.\n                \nDigital rectal exam. The health care professional also may perform a digital rectal exam. A digital rectal exam is a physical exam of the prostate and rectum. To perform the exam, the health care professional has the man bend over a table or lie on his side while holding his knees close to his chest. The health care professional slides a gloved, lubricated finger into the patients rectum and feels the part of the prostate that lies in front of the rectum. The digital rectal exam is used to check for stool or masses in the rectum and to assess whether the prostate is enlarged or tender, or has other abnormalities. The health care professional may perform a prostate massage during a digital rectal exam to collect a sample of prostate fluid that he or she can test for signs of infection.\n                \nThe health care professional may diagnose the type of UI based on the medical history and physical exam, or he or she may use the findings to determine if a man needs further diagnostic testing.\n                \nDiagnostic Tests\n                \nThe health care professional may order one or more of the following diagnostic tests based on the results of the medical history and physical exam:\n                \n- Urinalysis. Urinalysis involves testing a urine sample. The patient collects a urine sample in a special container at home, at a health care professionals office, or at a commercial facility. A health care professional tests the sample during an office visit or sends it to a lab for analysis. For the test, a nurse or technician places a strip of chemically treated paper, called a dipstick, into the urine. Patches on the dipstick change color to indicate signs of infection in urine.  - Urine culture. A health care professional performs a urine culture by placing part of a urine sample in a tube or dish with a substance that encourages any bacteria present to grow. A man collects the urine sample in a special container in a health care professionals office or a commercial facility. The office or facility tests the sample onsite or sends it to a lab for culture. A health care professional can identify bacteria that multiply, usually in 1 to 3 days. A health care professional performs a urine culture to determine the best treatment when urinalysis indicates the man has a UTI. More information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Urinary Tract Infections in Adults.  - Blood test. A blood test involves drawing blood at a health care professionals office or a commercial facility and sending the sample to a lab for analysis. The blood test can show kidney function problems or a chemical imbalance in the body. The lab also will test the blood to assess the level of prostate-specific antigen, a protein produced by prostate cells that may be higher in men with prostate cancer.  - Urodynamic testing. Urodynamic testing includes a variety of procedures that look at how well the bladder and urethra store and release urine. A health care professional performs urodynamic tests during an office visit or in an outpatient center or a hospital. Some urodynamic tests do not require anesthesia; others may require local anesthesia. Most urodynamic tests focus on the bladders ability to hold urine and empty steadily and completely; they may include the following:      - uroflowmetry, which measures how rapidly the bladder releases urine    - postvoid residual measurement, which evaluates how much urine remains in the bladder after urination    - reduced urine flow or residual urine in the bladder, which often suggests urine blockage due to BPH\n                \nMore information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Urodynamic Testing.",

        "original_answer": "Treatment depends on the type of UI.\n                \nUrgency Incontinence\n                \nAs a first line of therapy for urgency incontinence, a health care professional may recommend the following techniques to treat a mans problem:\n                \n- behavioral and lifestyle changes  - bladder training  - pelvic floor exercises  - urgency suppression\n                \nIf those treatments are not successful, the following additional measures may help urgency incontinence:\n                \n- medications  - electrical nerve stimulation  - bulking agents  - surgery\n                \nA health care professional may recommend other treatments for men with urgency incontinence caused by BPH. More information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Prostate Enlargement: Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia.\n                \nBehavioral and lifestyle changes. Men with urgency incontinence may be able to reduce leaks by making behavioral and lifestyle changes:\n                \n- Eating, diet, and nutrition. Men with urgency incontinence can change the amount and type of liquid they drink. A man can try limiting bladder irritantsincluding caffeinated drinks such as tea or coffee and carbonated beveragesto decrease leaks. Men also should limit alcoholic drinks, which can increase urine production. A health care professional can help a man determine how much he should drink based on his health, how active he is, and where he lives. To decrease nighttime trips to the restroom, men may want to stop drinking liquids several hours before bed.  - Engaging in physical activity. Although a man may be reluctant to engage in physical activity when he has urgency incontinence, regular exercise is important for good overall health and for preventing and treating UI.  - Losing weight. Men who are overweight should talk with a health care professional about strategies for losing weight, which can help improve UI.  - Preventing constipation. Gastrointestinal (GI) problems, especially constipation, can make urinary tract health worse and can lead to UI. The opposite is also true: Urinary problems, such as UI, can make GI problems worse. More information about how to prevent constipation through diet and physical activity is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Constipation.\n                \n\n                \nTo Help Prevent Bladder Problems, Stop Smoking   People who smoke should stop. Quitting smoking at any age promotes bladder health and overall health. Smoking increases a persons chance of developing stress incontinence, as it increases coughing. Some people say smoking worsens their bladder irritation. Smoking causes most cases of bladder cancer. People who smoke for many years have a higher risk of bladder cancer than nonsmokers or those who smoke for a short time.2 People who smoke should ask for help so they do not have to try quitting alone. Call 1-800-QUITNOW (1-800-784-8669) for more information.\n                \nBladder training. Bladder training is changing urination habits to decrease incidents of UI. The health care professional may suggest a man use the restroom at regular timed intervals, called timed voiding, based on the mans bladder diary. A man can gradually lengthen the time between trips to the restroom to help stretch the bladder so it can hold more urine.\n                \nPelvic floor muscle exercises. Pelvic floor muscle, or Kegel, exercises involve strengthening pelvic floor muscles. Strong pelvic floor muscles hold in urine more effectively than weak muscles. A man does not need special equipment for Kegel exercises. The exercises involve tightening and relaxing the muscles that control urine flow. Pelvic floor exercises should not be performed during urination. A health care professional can help a man learn proper technique. More information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Kegel Exercise Tips.\n                \nMen also may learn how to perform Kegel exercises properly by using biofeedback. Biofeedback uses special sensors to measure bodily functions, such as muscle contractions that control urination. A video monitor displays the measurements as graphs, and sounds indicate when the man is using the correct muscles. The health care professional uses the information to help the man change abnormal function of the pelvic floor muscles. At home, the man practices to improve muscle function. The man can perform the exercises while lying down, sitting at a desk, or standing up. Success with pelvic floor exercises depends on the cause of UI, its severity, and the mans ability to perform the exercises.\n                \nUrgency suppression. By using certain techniques, a man can suppress the urge to urinate, called urgency suppression. Urgency suppression is a way for a man to train his bladder to maintain control so he does not have to panic about finding a restroom. Some men use distraction techniques to take their mind off the urge to urinate. Other men find taking long, relaxing breaths and being still can help. Doing pelvic floor exercises also can help suppress the urge to urinate.\n                \nMedications. Health care professionals may prescribe medications that relax the bladder, decrease bladder spasms, or treat prostate enlargement to treat urgency incontinence in men.\n                \n- Antimuscarinics. Antimuscarinics can help relax bladder muscles and prevent bladder spasms. These medications include oxybutynin (Oxytrol), tolterodine (Detrol), darifenacin (Enablex), trospium (Sanctura), fesoterodine (Toviaz), and solifenacin (VESIcare). They are available in pill, liquid, and patch form.  - Tricyclic antidepressants. Tricyclic antidepressants such as imipramine (Tofranil) can calm nerve signals, decreasing spasms in bladder muscles.  - Alpha-blockers. Terazosin (Hytrin), doxazosin (Cardura), tamsulosin (Flomax), alfuzosin (Uroxatral), and silodosin (Rapaflo) are used to treat problems caused by prostate enlargement and bladder outlet obstruction. These medications relax the smooth muscle of the prostate and bladder neck, which lets urine flow normally and prevents abnormal bladder contractions that can lead to urgency incontinence.  - 5-alpha reductase inhibitors. Finasteride (Proscar) and dutasteride (Avodart) block the production of the male hormone dihydrotestosterone, which accumulates in the prostate and may cause prostate growth. These medications may help to relieve urgency incontinence problems by shrinking an enlarged prostate.  - Beta-3 agonists. Mirabegron (Myrbetriq) is a beta-3 agonist a person takes by mouth to help prevent symptoms of urgency incontinence. Mirabegron suppresses involuntary bladder contractions.  - Botox. A health care professional may use onabotulinumtoxinA (Botox), also called botulinum toxin type A, to treat UI in men with neurological conditions such as spinal cord injury or multiple sclerosis. Injecting Botox into the bladder relaxes the bladder, increasing storage capacity and decreasing UI. A health care professional performs the procedure during an office visit. A man receives local anesthesia. The health care professional uses a cystoscope to guide the needle for injecting the Botox. Botox is effective for up to 10 months.3\n                \nElectrical nerve stimulation. If behavioral and lifestyle changes and medications do not improve symptoms, a urologist may suggest electrical nerve stimulation as an option to prevent UI, urinary frequencyurination more often than normaland other symptoms. Electrical nerve stimulation involves altering bladder reflexes using pulses of electricity. The two most common types of electrical nerve stimulation are percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation and sacral nerve stimulation.4\n                \n- Percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation uses electrical stimulation of the tibial nerve, which is located in the ankle, on a weekly basis. The patient receives local anesthesia for the procedure. In an outpatient center, a urologist inserts a battery-operated stimulator beneath the skin near the tibial nerve. Electrical stimulation of the tibial nerve prevents bladder activity by interfering with the pathway between the bladder and the spinal cord or brain. Although researchers consider percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation safe, they continue to study the exact ways that it prevents symptoms and how long the treatment can last.  - Sacral nerve stimulation involves implanting a battery-operated stimulator beneath the skin in the lower back near the sacral nerve. The procedure takes place in an outpatient center using local anesthesia. Based on the patients feedback, the health care professional can adjust the amount of stimulation so it works best for that individual. The electrical pulses enter the body for minutes to hours, two or more times a day, either through wires placed on the lower back or just above the pubic areabetween the navel and the pubic hair. Sacral nerve stimulation may increase blood flow to the bladder, strengthen pelvic muscles that help control the bladder, and trigger the release of natural substances that block pain. The patient can turn the stimulator on or off at any time.\n                \nA patient may consider getting an implanted device that delivers regular impulses to the bladder. A urologist places a wire next to the tailbone and attaches it to a permanent stimulator under the skin.\n                \nBulking agents. A urologist injects bulking agents, such as collagen and carbon spheres, near the urinary sphincter to treat incontinence. The bulking agent makes the tissues thicker and helps close the bladder opening. Before the procedure, the health care professional may perform a skin test to make sure the man doesnt have an allergic reaction to the bulking agent. A urologist performs the procedure during an office visit. The man receives local anesthesia. The urologist uses a cystoscopea tubelike instrument used to look inside the urethra and bladderto guide the needle for injection of the bulking agent. Over time, the body may slowly eliminate certain bulking agents, so a man may need to have injections again.\n                \nSurgery. As a last resort, surgery to treat urgency incontinence in men includes the artificial urinary sphincter (AUS) and the male sling. A health care professional performs the surgery in a hospital with regional or general anesthesia. Most men can leave the hospital the same day, although some may need to stay overnight.\n                \n- AUS. An AUS is an implanted device that keeps the urethra closed until the man is ready to urinate. The device has three parts: a cuff that fits around the urethra, a small balloon reservoir placed in the abdomen, and a pump placed in the scrotumthe sac that holds the testicles. The cuff contains a liquid that makes it fit tightly around the urethra to prevent urine from leaking. When it is time to urinate, the man squeezes the pump with his fingers to deflate the cuff. The liquid moves to the balloon reservoir and lets urine flow through the urethra. When the bladder is empty, the cuff automatically refills in the next 2 to 5 minutes to keep the urethra tightly closed.  - Male sling. A health care professional performs a sling procedure, also called urethral compression procedure, to add support to the urethra, which can sometimes better control urination. Through an incision in the tissue between the scrotum and the rectum, also called the perineum, the health care professional uses a piece of human tissue or mesh to compress the urethra against the pubic bone. The surgeon secures the ends of the tissue or mesh around the pelvic bones. The lifting and compression of the urethra sometimes provides better control over urination.\n                \nStress Incontinence\n                \nMen who have stress incontinence can use the same techniques for treating urgency incontinence.\n                \nFunctional Incontinence\n                \nMen with functional incontinence may wear protective undergarments if they worry about reaching a restroom in time. These products include adult diapers or pads and are available from drugstores, grocery stores, and medical supply stores. Men who have functional incontinence should talk to a health care professional about its cause and how to prevent or treat functional incontinence.\n                \nOverflow Incontinence\n                \nA health care professional treats overflow incontinence caused by a blockage in the urinary tract with surgery to remove the obstruction. Men with overflow incontinence that is not caused by a blockage may need to use a catheter to empty the bladder. A catheter is a thin, flexible tube that is inserted through the urethra into the bladder to drain urine. A health care professional can teach a man how to use a catheter. A man may need to use a catheter once in a while, a few times a day, or all the time. Catheters that are used continuously drain urine from the bladder into a bag that is attached to the mans thigh with a strap. Men using a continuous catheter should watch for symptoms of an infection.\n                \nTransient Incontinence\n                \nA health care professional treats transient incontinence by addressing the underlying cause. For example, if a medication is causing increased urine production leading to UI, a health care professional may try lowering the dose or prescribing a different medication. A health care professional may prescribe bacteria-fighting medications called antibiotics to treat UTIs.",

        "original_answer": "- Urinary incontinence (UI) is the loss of bladder control, resulting in the accidental leakage of urine from the body.  - The urinary tract is the bodys drainage system for removing urine, which is composed of wastes and extra fluid.  - Every day, the kidneys filter about 120 to 150 quarts of blood to produce about 1 to 2 quarts of urine.  - To urinate, the brain signals the muscular bladder wall to tighten, squeezing urine out of the bladder. At the same time, the brain signals the sphincters to relax. As the sphincters relax, urine exits the bladder through the urethra.  - UI results when the brain does not properly signal the bladder, the sphincters do not squeeze strongly enough, or both.  - Urgency incontinence happens when a man urinates involuntarily after he has a strong desire, or urgency, to urinate.  - Stress incontinence results from movements that put pressure on the bladder and cause urine leakage, such as coughing, sneezing, laughing, or physical activity.  - Functional incontinence occurs when physical disability, external obstacles, or problems in thinking or communicating keep a person from reaching a place to urinate in time.  - When the bladder doesnt empty properly, urine spills over, causing overflow incontinence. Weak bladder muscles or a blocked urethra can cause this type of incontinence.  - Transient incontinence is UI that lasts a short time. Transient incontinence is usually a side effect of certain medications, drugs, or temporary conditions.  - UI occurs in 11 to 34 percent of older men.  - Men should tell a health care professional, such as a family practice physician, a nurse, an internist, or a urologist, they have UI, even if they feel embarrassed.  - Treatment depends on the type of UI. Some types of treatment include behavioral and lifestyle changes, bladder training, pelvic floor exercises, and urgency suppression.  - People who smoke should stop. Quitting smoking at any age promotes bladder health and overall health.",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Nerve disease can cause bladder control problems because the brain and nerves play an essential role in controlling the bladder. When the nerves are damaged or not functioning properly, the brain may not receive the signals that the bladder is full, or the bladder muscles may not get the message to contract and release urine. This can result in urinary incontinence, frequent urination, or difficulty emptying the bladder.\n\nThere are several causes of nerve disease that can affect bladder control, including:\n\n1. Diabetes: High blood sugar levels can damage the nerves over time, leading to nerve disease and bladder control problems.\n2. Multiple sclerosis: This autoimmune disease affects the central nervous system, including the nerves that control the bladder.\n3. Parkinson's disease: This progressive nervous system disorder affects movement and can also cause bladder control problems.\n4. Spinal cord injuries: Damage to the spinal cord can interrupt the communication between the brain and the bladder, leading to bladder control issues.\n5. Stroke: A stroke can damage the brain and nerves, leading to bladder control problems.\n6.

        "original_answer": "Nerves that work poorly can lead to three different kinds of bladder control problems.\n                \nOveractive bladder. Damaged nerves may send signals to the bladder at the wrong time, causing its muscles to squeeze without warning. The symptoms of overactive bladder include\n                \n- urinary frequencydefined as urination eight or more times a day or two or more times at night  - urinary urgencythe sudden, strong need to urinate immediately  - urge incontinenceleakage of urine that follows a sudden, strong urge to urinate\n                \nPoor control of sphincter muscles. Sphincter muscles surround the urethra and keep it closed to hold urine in the bladder. If the nerves to the sphincter muscles are damaged, the muscles may become loose and allow leakage or stay tight when you are trying to release urine.\n                \nUrine retention. For some people, nerve damage means their bladder muscles do not get the message that it is time to release urine or are too weak to completely empty the bladder. If the bladder becomes too full, urine may back up and the increasing pressure may damage the kidneys. Or urine that stays too long may lead to an infection in the kidneys or bladder. Urine retention may also lead to overflow incontinence.",

        "original_answer": "The treatment for a bladder control problem depends on the cause of the nerve damage and the type of voiding dysfunction that results.\n                \nIn the case of overactive bladder, your doctor may suggest a number of strategies, including bladder training, electrical stimulation, drug therapy, and, in severe cases where all other treatments have failed, surgery.\n                \nBladder training. Your doctor may ask you to keep a bladder diary-a record of your fluid intake, trips to the bathroom, and episodes of urine leakage. This record may indicate a pattern and suggest ways to avoid accidents by making a point of using the bathroom at certain times of the day-a practice called timed voiding. As you gain control, you can extend the time between trips to the bathroom. Bladder training also includes Kegel exercises to strengthen the muscles that hold in urine.\n                \nElectrical stimulation. Mild electrical pulses can be used to stimulate the nerves that control the bladder and sphincter muscles. Depending on which nerves the doctor plans to treat, these pulses can be given through the vagina or anus, or by using patches on the skin. Another method is a minor surgical procedure to place the electric wire near the tailbone. This procedure involves two steps. First, the wire is placed under the skin and connected to a temporary stimulator, which you carry with you for several days. If your condition improves during this trial period, then the wire is placed next to the tailbone and attached to a permanent stimulator under your skin. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved this device, marketed as the InterStim system, to treat urge incontinence, urgency-frequency syndrome, and urinary retention in patients for whom other treatments have not worked.\n                \nDrug therapy. Different drugs can affect the nerves and muscles of the urinary tract in different ways.\n                \n-  Drugs that relax bladder muscles and prevent bladder spasms include oxybutynin chloride (Ditropan), tolterodine (Detrol), hyoscyamine (Levsin), and propantheline bromide (Pro-Banthine), which belong to the class of drugs called anticholinergics. Their most common side effect is dry mouth, although large doses may cause blurred vision, constipation, a faster heartbeat, and flushing. A new patch delivery system for oxybutynin (Oxytrol) may decrease side effects. Ditropan XL and Detrol LA are timed-release formulations that deliver a low level of the drug continuously in the body. These drugs have the advantage of once-a-day administration. In 2004, the FDA approved trospium chloride (Sanctura), darifenacin (Enablex), and solifenacin succinate (VESIcare) for the treatment of overactive bladder.  -  Drugs for depression that also relax bladder muscles include imipramine hydrochloride (Tofranil), a tricyclic antidepressant. Side effects may include fatigue, dry mouth, dizziness, blurred vision, nausea, and insomnia.\n                \nAdditional drugs are being evaluated for the treatment of overactive bladder and may soon receive FDA approval.\n                \nSurgery. In extreme cases, when incontinence is severe and other treatments have failed, surgery may be considered. The bladder may be made larger through an operation known as augmentation cystoplasty, in which a part of the diseased bladder is replaced with a section taken from the patient's bowel. This operation may improve the ability to store urine but may make the bladder more difficult to empty, making regular catheterization necessary. Additional risks of surgery include the bladder breaking open and leaking urine into the body, bladder stones, mucus in the bladder, and infection.",

        "original_answer": "The job of the sphincter muscles is to hold urine in the bladder by squeezing the urethra shut. If the urethral sphincter fails to stay closed, urine may leak out of the bladder. When nerve signals are coordinated properly, the sphincter muscles relax to allow urine to pass through the urethra as the bladder contracts to push out urine. If the signals are not coordinated, the bladder and the sphincter may contract at the same time, so urine cannot pass easily.\n                \nDrug therapy for an uncoordinated bladder and urethra. Scientists have not yet found a drug that works selectively on the urethral sphincter muscles, but drugs used to reduce muscle spasms or tremors are sometimes used to help the sphincter relax. Baclofen (Lioresal) is prescribed for muscle spasms or cramping in patients with multiple sclerosis and spinal injuries. Diazepam (Valium) can be taken as a muscle relaxant or to reduce anxiety. Drugs called alpha-adrenergic blockers can also be used to relax the sphincter. Examples of these drugs are alfuzosin (UroXatral), tamsulosin (Flomax), terazosin (Hytrin), and doxazosin (Cardura). The main side effects are low blood pressure, dizziness, fainting, and nasal congestion. All of these drugs have been used to relax the urethral sphincter in people whose sphincter does not relax well on its own.\n                \nBotox injection. Botulinum toxin type A (Botox) is best known as a cosmetic treatment for facial wrinkles. Doctors have also found that botulinum toxin is useful in blocking spasms like eye ticks or relaxing muscles in patients with multiple sclerosis. Urologists have found that injecting botulinum toxin into the tissue surrounding the sphincter can help it to relax. Although the FDA has approved botulinum toxin only for facial cosmetic purposes, researchers are studying the safety and effectiveness of botulinum toxin injection into the sphincter for possible FDA approval in the future.",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Nerve damage that affects bladder control can be treated in several ways, depending on the underlying cause and severity of the condition. Here are some common treatments:\n\n1. Medications: Certain medications can help improve bladder function and reduce symptoms. These may include anticholinergics, which can help relax the bladder muscle, or mirabegron, which can help increase bladder capacity.\n2. Bladder training: This involves learning to hold urine for longer periods of time to help stretch the bladder and improve its capacity.\n3. Electrical stimulation: This involves using electrical impulses to stimulate the nerves that control bladder function. This can help improve bladder sensation and reduce incontinence.\n4. Surgery: In some cases, surgery may be necessary to treat nerve damage that affects bladder control. This may include procedures to implant a nerve stimulator or to widen the bladder.\n5. Lifestyle changes: Making certain lifestyle changes, such as avoiding caffeine and alcohol, quitting smoking, and maintaining a healthy weight, can also help improve bladder control.\n\nIt's important to note that the best treatment for nerve disease and bladder control will depend on the underlying cause of the condition.

        "original_answer": "Urine retention may occur either because the bladder wall muscles cannot contract or because the sphincter muscles cannot relax.\n                \nCatheter. A catheter is a thin tube that can be inserted through the urethra into the bladder to allow urine to flow into a collection bag. If you are able to place the catheter yourself, you can learn to carry out the procedure at regular intervals, a practice called clean intermittent catheterization. Some patients cannot place their own catheters because nerve damage affects their hand coordination as well as their voiding function. These patients need to have a caregiver place the catheter for them at regular intervals. If regular catheter placement is not feasible, the patients may need to have an indwelling catheter that can be changed less often. Indwelling catheters have several risks, including infection, bladder stones, and bladder tumors. However, if the bladder cannot be emptied any other way, then the catheter is the only way to stop the buildup of urine in the bladder that can damage the kidneys.\n                \nUrethral stent. Stents are small tube-like devices inserted into the urethra and allowed to expand, like a spring, widening the opening for urine to flow out. Stents can help prevent urine backup when the bladder wall and sphincter contract at the same time because of improper nerve signals. However, stents can cause problems if they move or lead to infection.\n                \nSurgery. Men may consider a surgery that removes the external sphincter-a sphincterotomy-or a piece of it-a sphincter resection-to prevent urinary retention. The surgeon will pass a thin instrument through the urethra to deliver electrical or laser energy that burns away sphincter tissue. Possible complications include bleeding that requires a transfusion and, rarely, problems with erections. This procedure causes loss of urine control and requires the patient to collect urine by wearing an external catheter that fits over the penis like a condom. No external collection device is available for women.\n                \nUrinary diversion. If other treatments fail and urine regularly backs up and damages the kidneys, the doctor may recommend a urinary diversion, a procedure that may require an outside collection bag attached to a stoma, a surgically created opening where urine passes out of the body. Another form of urinary diversion replaces the bladder with a continent urinary reservoir, an internal pouch made from sections of the bowel or other tissue. This method allows the person to store urine inside the body until a catheter is used to empty it through a stoma.",

        "original_answer": "The thyroid is a 2-inch-long, butterfly-shaped gland weighing less than 1 ounce. Located in the front of the neck below the larynx, or voice box, it has two lobes, one on either side of the windpipe. The thyroid is one of the glands that make up the endocrine system.

A health care provider uses a grading system to determine the severity of a womans cystocele. A cystocele receives one of three grades depending on how far a womans bladder has dropped into her vagina:\n                \n- grade 1mild, when the bladder drops only a short way into the vagina  - grade 2moderate, when the bladder drops far enough to reach the opening of the vagina  - grade 3most advanced, when the bladder bulges out through the opening of the vagina\n                \nIf a woman has difficulty emptying her bladder, a health care provider may measure the amount of urine left in the womans bladder after she urinates. The remaining urine is called the postvoid residual. A health care provider can measure postvoid residual with a bladder ultrasound. A bladder ultrasound uses a device, called a transducer, that bounces safe, painless sound waves off the bladder to create an image and show the amount of remaining urine. A specially trained technician performs the procedure, and a radiologista doctor who specializes in medical imaginginterprets the images. A woman does not need anesthesia.\n                \nA health care provider can also use a cathetera thin, flexible tubeto measure a womans postvoid residual. The health care provider inserts the catheter through the womans urethra into her bladder to remove and measure the amount of remaining urine after the woman has urinated. A postvoid residual of 100 mL or more is a sign that the woman is not completely emptying her bladder. A woman receives local anesthesia.\n                \nA health care provider may use a voiding cystourethrograman x-ray exam of the bladderto diagnose a cystocele as well. A woman gets a voiding cystourethrogram while urinating. The x-ray images show the shape of the womans bladder and let the health care provider see any problems that might block normal urine flow. An x-ray technician performs a voiding cystourethrogram, and a radiologist interprets the images. A woman does not need anesthesia; however, some women may receive sedation. A health care provider may order additional tests to rule out problems in other parts of a womans urinary tract.",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "A cystocele, also known as a prolapsed bladder, is a condition where the bladder droops into the vagina. Treatment options include:\n\n1. Pessary: A device inserted into the vagina to hold the bladder in place.\n2. Kegel exercises: Pelvic floor exercises that can strengthen the muscles that support the bladder.\n3. Surgery: To repair the damaged muscles and support tissue. This is usually considered if other treatments have not been successful.\n\nIt's important to note that the best treatment plan depends on the severity of the cystocele and the patient's overall health. Always consult with a healthcare provider for personalized medical advice.",
        "original_answer": "Cystocele treatment depends on the severity of the cystocele and whether a woman has symptoms. If a womans cystocele does not bother her, a health care provider may recommend only that she avoid heavy lifting or straining, which could worsen her cystocele. If a woman has symptoms that bother her and wants treatment, the health care provider may recommend pelvic muscle exercises, a vaginal pessary, or surgery.\n                \nPelvic floor, or Kegel, exercises involve strengthening pelvic floor muscles. Strong pelvic floor muscles more effectively hold pelvic organs in place. A woman does not need special equipment for Kegel exercises.\n                \nThe exercises involve tightening and relaxing the muscles that support pelvic organs. A health care provider can help a woman learn proper technique.\n                \nMore information about pelvic muscle exercises is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Kegel Exercise Tips.\n                \nA vaginal pessary is a small, silicone medical device placed in the vagina that supports the vaginal wall and holds the bladder in place. Pessaries come in a number of shapes and sizes. A health care provider has many options to choose from to find the most comfortable pessary for a woman.\n                \nA heath care provider may recommend surgery to repair the vaginal wall support and reposition the womans bladder to its normal position. The most common cystocele repair is an anterior vaginal repairor anterior colporrhaphy. The surgeon makes an incision in the wall of the womans vagina and repairs the defect by folding over and sewing together extra supportive tissue between the vagina and bladder. The repair tightens the layers of tissue that separate the organs, creating more support for the bladder. A surgeon who specializes in the urinary tract or female reproductive system performs an anterior vaginal repair in a hospital. The woman receives either regional or general anesthesia. The woman may stay overnight in the hospital, and full recovery may take up to 4 to 6 weeks.",

PKD cysts can greatly enlarge the kidneys while replacing much of their normal structure, resulting in chronic kidney disease (CKD), which causes reduced kidney function over time. CKD may lead to kidney failure, described as end-stage kidney disease or ESRD when treated with a kidney transplant or blood-filtering treatments called dialysis. The two main types of PKD are autosomal dominant PKD and autosomal recessive PKD.\n                \nPKD cysts are different from the usually harmless simple cysts that often form in the kidneys later in life.

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Polycystic Kidney Disease (PKD) is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in certain genes. These genes control the formation of the kidney's structure. When they are mutated, cysts form in the kidneys, leading to PKD. It can be inherited from parents, or in some cases, mutations can occur spontaneously.",
        "original_answer": "A gene mutation, or defect, causes polycystic kidney disease. Genes provide instructions for making proteins in the body. A gene mutation is a permanent change in the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequence that makes up a gene. In most cases of PKD, a person inherits the gene mutation, meaning a parent passes it on in his or her genes. In the remaining cases, the gene mutation develops spontaneously. In spontaneous cases, neither parent carries a copy of the mutated gene.\n                \nResearchers have found three different gene mutations associated with PKD. Two of the genes are associated with autosomal dominant PKD. The third gene is associated with autosomal recessive PKD. Gene mutations that cause PKD affect proteins that play a role in kidney development.\n                \n\n                \nGenetic Disorders   Each cell contains thousands of genes that provide the instructions for making proteins for growth and repair of the body. If a gene has a mutation, the protein made by that gene may not function properly, which sometimes creates a genetic disorder. Not all gene mutations cause a disorder.   People inherit two copies of most genes; one copy from each parent. A genetic disorder occurs when one or both parents pass a mutated gene to a child at conception. A genetic disorder can also occur through a spontaneous gene mutation, meaning neither parent carries a copy of the mutated gene. Once a spontaneous gene mutation has occurred, a person can pass it to his or her children.

        "original_answer": "The complications of autosomal dominant PKD include the following:\n                \n- Pain. Cyst infection, other types of urinary tract infections (UTIs), bleeding into cysts, kidney stones, or stretching of the fibrous tissue around the kidney because of cyst growth can cause pain in the area of the kidneys.  - High blood pressure. High blood pressure is present in about half of the people with autosomal dominant PKD and normal kidney function between the ages of 20 and 35.4 Almost 100 percent of people with kidney failure and autosomal dominant PKD have high blood pressure.1 High blood pressuregreater than 140/90 mm Hgincreases the likelihood of heart disease and stroke, as well as adding to the damage already done to the kidneys by the cysts.  - Kidney failure. Kidney failure means the kidneys no longer work well enough to maintain health. A person with kidney failure may have the following symptoms:      - little or no urination    - edemaswelling, usually in the legs, feet, or ankles and less often in the hands or face    - drowsiness    - fatigue, or feeling tired    - generalized itching or numbness    - dry skin    - headaches    - weight loss    - appetite loss    - nausea    - vomiting    - sleep problems    - trouble concentrating    - darkened skin    - muscle cramps    - shortness of breath    - chest pain\n                \nUntreated kidney failure can lead to coma and death. More than half of people with autosomal dominant PKD progress to kidney failure by age 70.1\n                \n- UTIs. Kidney cysts block the flow of urine through the kidneys. Stagnant urine can set the stage for infection. Bacteria enter the urinary tract through the urethra and spread up to the kidneys. Sometimes, the kidney cysts become infected. UTIs may cause scarring in the kidneys.  - Kidney stones. About 20 percent of people with autosomal dominant PKD have kidney stones.1 Kidney stones can block the flow of urine and cause pain.  - Liver cysts. Liver cysts are the most common nonkidney complication of autosomal dominant PKD.1 Liver cysts generally cause no symptoms.  - Pancreatic cysts. PKD can also cause cysts in the pancreas. Pancreatic cysts rarely cause pancreatitisinflammation, or swelling, of the pancreas.  - Abnormal heart valves. Abnormal heart valves may occur in up to 25 percent of people with autosomal dominant PKD.1 Insufficient blood flow in the aortathe large artery that carries blood from the heartmay result from the abnormal heart valves.  - Diverticula. Diverticula are small pouches, or sacs, that push outward through weak spots in the colon wall. This complication is more common in people with PKD who have kidney failure.1  - Brain aneurysms. An aneurysm is a bulge in the wall of a blood vessel. Aneurysms in the brain might cause headaches that are severe or feel different from other headaches. Brain aneurysms can rupture, or break open, causing bleeding inside the skull. A ruptured aneurysm in the brain is a life-threatening condition and requires immediate medical attention.",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Polycystic Kidney Disease (PKD) is a genetic disorder characterized by the growth of numerous cysts in the kidneys. Here are some potential complications of PKD:\n\n1. Kidney failure: PKD can cause cysts to grow and multiply, which can lead to kidney damage and eventually kidney failure.\n2. High blood pressure: The growth of cysts in the kidneys can lead to the development of high blood pressure, which can increase the risk of heart disease and stroke.\n3. Chronic pain: The growth of cysts in the kidneys can cause chronic pain in the back or sides.\n4. Urinary tract or kidney infections: The cysts in the kidneys can become infected, leading to urinary tract or kidney infections.\n5. Kidney stones: The growth of cysts in the kidneys can increase the risk of developing kidney stones.\n6. Liver cysts: PKD can also affect the liver, leading to the growth of cysts in the liver.\n7. Heart valve abnormalities: Some people with PKD may have heart valve abnormalities, which can increase the risk of heart disease.\n\nIt's important to note that not everyone with PKD will experience all of these complications, and some people may not experience any complications at all. Regular check-ups with a healthcare provider can help monitor the progression of PKD and manage any complications that may arise.",
        "original_answer": "Babies with the most severe cases of autosomal recessive PKD often die hours or days after birth because they cannot breathe well enough to sustain life. Their lungs do not develop as they should during the prenatal period. Pressure from enlarged kidneys also contributes to breathing problems.\n                \nChildren born with autosomal recessive PKD often develop kidney failure before reaching adulthood.\n                \nLiver scarring occurs in all people with autosomal recessive PKD and is usually present at birth. However, liver problems tend to become more of a concern as people with autosomal recessive PKD grow older. Liver scarring can lead to progressive liver dysfunction and other problems.\n                \nAdditional complications of autosomal recessive PKD include high blood pressure and UTIs.",

People with any kind of kidney disease, including PKD, should talk with a dietitian about foods that should be added to their diet and foods that might be harmful.\n                \nPKD may require diet changes for blood pressure control. Kidney disease in general also calls for certain diet changes.\n                \nFollowing a healthy eating plan can help lower blood pressure. A health care provider may recommend the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating plan, which focuses on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and other foods that are heart healthy and lower in sodium, which often comes from salt. The DASH eating plan\n                \n- is low in fat and cholesterol  - features fat-free or low-fat milk and dairy products, fish, poultry, and nuts  - suggests less red meat, sweets, added sugars, and sugar-containing beverages  - is rich in nutrients, protein, and fiber\n                \nMore information about the DASH eating planis available from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute.\n                \nAs your kidneys become more damaged, you may need to eat foods that are lower in phosphorus and potassium.

Everyone needs protein. However, protein breaks down into wastes the kidneys must remove. Large amounts of protein make the kidneys work harder. High-quality proteins such as meat, fish, and eggs create fewer wastes than other sources of protein. Beans, whole grains, soy products, nuts and nut butters, and dairy products can also be good sources of protein. Most people eat more protein than they need. Eating high-quality protein and smaller portions of protein can help protect the kidneys.\n                \nMore information about nutrition for kidney disease is provided in the NIDDK health topics:\n                \n- Nutrition for Children with Chronic Kidney Disease  - Nutrition for Adults with Early Chronic Kidney Disease  - Nutrition for Adults with Advanced Chronic Kidney Disease\n                \nThe National Kidney Disease Education Program offers a series of easy-to-read fact sheets about nutrition for people with CKD.",

        "original_answer": "People with a solitary kidney do not need to eat a special diet. However, people with reduced kidney function may need to make changes to their diet to slow the progression of kidney disease. More information about recommended dietary changes is provided in the NIDDK health topics, Nutrition for Early Chronic Kidney Disease in Adults and Nutrition for Advanced Chronic Kidney Disease in Adults, and on the National Kidney Disease Education Program website. People should talk with their health care provider about what diet is right for them.\n                \nControlling Blood Pressure\n                \nPeople can control their blood pressure by not smoking, eating a healthy diet, and taking certain medications. Medications that lower blood pressure can also significantly slow the progression of kidney disease. Two types of blood pressurelowering medications, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), have proven effective in slowing the progression of kidney disease. Many people require two or more medications to control their blood pressure. In addition to an ACE inhibitor or ARB, a diuretica medication that helps the kidneys remove fluid from the bloodmay be prescribed. Beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and other blood pressure medications may also be needed.\n                \nPreventing Injury\n                \nFor people with a solitary kidney, loss of the remaining working kidney results in the need for dialysis or kidney transplant. People should make sure their health care providers know they have a solitary kidney to prevent injury from medications or medical procedures. People who participate in certain sports may be more likely to injure the kidney; this risk is of particular concern with children, as they are more likely to play sports. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends individual assessment for contact, collision, and limited-contact sports. Protective equipment may reduce the chance of injury to the remaining kidney enough to allow participation in most sports, provided that such equipment remains in place during activity.

However, if a cyst grows large enough, it can cause symptoms such as:\n\n1. Pain in the back or side\n2. Abdominal pain\n3. Blood in the urine (hematuria)\n4. Fever\n5. Fatigue\n\nIt is important to note that these symptoms can also be caused by other conditions, so it is essential to consult a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis. Simple kidney cysts are typically found during imaging tests conducted for other reasons.",
        "original_answer": "Simple kidney cysts usually do not cause symptoms or harm the kidneys. In some cases, however, pain can occur between the ribs and hips when cysts enlarge and press on other organs. Sometimes cysts become infected, causing fever, pain, and tenderness. Simple kidney cysts are not thought to affect kidney function, but one study found an association between the presence of cysts and reduced kidney function in hospitalized people younger than 60 years of age.1 Some studies have found a relationship between simple kidney cysts and high blood pressure. For example, high blood pressure has improved in some people after a large cyst was drained. However, this relationship is not well understood.2",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Simple kidney cysts are typically diagnosed through imaging tests such as ultrasound, CT scan, or MRI. These tests can help to visualize the cysts and determine their size, number, and location. In many cases, simple kidney cysts are asymptomatic and are discovered incidentally during imaging tests performed for other reasons. If a cyst is causing symptoms, such as pain or discomfort, additional tests may be needed to determine if the cyst is causing any complications or if it is a complex cyst that requires further treatment. It is important to note that a diagnosis should be made by a qualified healthcare professional.",
        "original_answer": "Most simple kidney cysts are found during imaging tests done for other reasons. When a cyst is found, the following imaging tests can be used to determine whether it is a simple kidney cyst or another, more serious condition. These imaging tests are performed at an outpatient center or hospital by a specially trained technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologista doctor who specializes in medical imaging. Ultrasound may also be performed in a health care providers office. Anesthesia is not needed though light sedation may be used for people with a fear of confined spaces who undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).\n                \n- Ultrasound. Ultrasound uses a device, called a transducer, that bounces safe, painless sound waves off organs to create an image of their structure. An abdominal ultrasound can create images of the entire urinary tract. The images can be used to distinguish harmless cysts from other problems.  - Computerized tomography (CT) scan. CT scans use a combination of x rays and computer technology to create three-dimensional (3-D) images. A CT scan may include the injection of a special dye, called contrast medium. CT scans require the person to lie on a table that slides into a tunnel-shaped device where the x rays are taken. CT scans can show cysts and tumors in the kidneys.  - MRI. MRI machines use radio waves and magnets to produce detailed pictures of the bodys internal organs and soft tissues without using x rays. An MRI may include the injection of contrast medium. With most MRI machines, the person lies on a table that slides into a tunnel-shaped device that may be open ended or closed at one end; some newer machines are designed to allow the person to lie in a more open space. Like CT scans, MRIs can show cysts and tumors.",

Simple kidney cysts may be monitored with periodic ultrasounds.\n                \nSimple kidney cysts that are causing symptoms or blocking the flow of blood or urine through the kidney may need to be treated using a procedure called sclerotherapy. In sclerotherapy, the doctor punctures the cyst using a long needle inserted through the skin. Ultrasound is used to guide the needle to the cyst. The cyst is drained and then filled with a solution containing alcohol to make the kidney tissue harder. The procedure is usually performed on an outpatient basis with a local anesthetic.\n                \nIf the cyst is large, surgery may be needed. Most surgeries can be performed using a laparoscopea special tool with a small, lighted video camera. The procedure is usually done under general anesthesia in a hospital.

        "original_answer": "The urinary tract is the bodys drainage system for removing wastes and extra water. The urinary tract includes two kidneys, two ureters, a bladder, and a urethra. The kidneys are a pair of bean-shaped organs, each about the size of a fist and located below the ribs, one on each side of the spine, toward the middle of the back. Every minute, a persons kidneys filter about 3 ounces of blood, removing wastes and extra water. The wastes and extra water make up the 1 to 2 quarts of urine an adult produces each day. Children produce less urine each day; the amount produced depends on their age. The urine travels from the kidneys down two narrow tubes called the ureters. The urine is then stored in a balloonlike organ called the bladder. When the bladder empties, urine flows out of the body through a tube called the urethra at the bottom of the bladder.",

Medications: Some medications, such as certain types of antibiotics and chemotherapy drugs, can increase the risk of kidney stones.\n\nIt's important to note that kidney stones in children are relatively rare, but if they do occur, it's important to seek medical attention to prevent complications.",
        "original_answer": "Kidney stones can form when substances in the urinesuch as calcium, magnesium, oxalate, and phosphorousbecome highly concentrated due to one or more causes:\n                \n- Defects in the urinary tract may block the flow of urine and create pools of urine. In stagnant urine, stone-forming substances tend to settle together into stones. Up to one-third of children who have stones have an anatomic abnormality in their urinary tract.  - Kidney stones may have a genetic cause. In other words, the tendency to form stones can run in families due to inherited factors.  - An unhealthy lifestyle may make children more likely to have kidney stones. For example, drinking too little water or drinking the wrong types of fluids, such as soft drinks or drinks with caffeine, may cause substances in the urine to become too concentrated. Similarly, too much sodium, or salt, in the diet may contribute to more chemicals in the urine, causing an increase in stone formation. Some doctors believe increases in obesity rates, less active lifestyles, and diets higher in salt may be causing more children to have kidney stones.  - Sometimes, a urinary tract infection can cause kidney stones to form. Some types of bacteria in the urinary tract break down ureaa waste product removed from the blood by the kidneysinto substances that form stones.  - Some children have metabolic disorders that lead to kidney stones. Metabolism is the way the body uses digested food for energy, including the process of breaking down food, using foods nutrients in the body, and removing the wastes that remain. The most common metabolic disorder that causes kidney stones in children is hypercalciuria, which causes extra calcium to collect in the urine. Other more rare metabolic conditions involve problems breaking down oxalate, a substance made in the body and found in some foods. These conditions include hyperoxaluria, too much oxalate in the urine, and oxalosis, characterized by deposits of oxalate and calcium in the bodys tissues. Another rare metabolic condition called cystinuria can cause kidney stones. Cystinuria is an excess of the amino acid cystine in the urine. Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins.",

        "original_answer": "Four major types of kidney stones occur in children:\n                \n- Calcium stones are the most common type of kidney stone and occur in two major forms: calcium oxalate and calcium phosphate. Calcium oxalate stones are more common. Calcium oxalate stone formation has various causes, which may include high calcium excretion, high oxalate excretion, or acidic urine. Calcium phosphate stones are caused by alkaline urine.  - Uric acid stones form when the urine is persistently acidic. A diet rich in purinessubstances found in animal proteins such as meats, fish, and shellfishmay cause uric acid. If uric acid becomes concentrated in the urine, it can settle and form a stone by itself or along with calcium.  - Struvite stones result from kidney infections. Eliminating infected stones from the urinary tract and staying infectionfree can prevent more struvite stones.  - Cystine stones result from a genetic disorder that causes cystine to leak through the kidneys and into the urine in high concentration, forming crystals that tend to accumulate into stones.",

Blood tests: Blood tests can provide information about the child's overall health and may reveal abnormalities in the levels of certain chemicals that can indicate kidney stones.\n\nIf a kidney stone is diagnosed, the doctor will determine the best course of treatment based on the size, location, and composition of the stone, as well as the child's age, overall health, and medical history.",
        "original_answer": "The process of diagnosing any illness begins with consideration of the symptoms. Pain or bloody urine may be the first symptom. Urine, blood, and imaging tests will help determine whether symptoms are caused by a stone. Urine tests can be used to check for infection and for substances that form stones. Blood tests can be used to check for biochemical problems that can lead to kidney stones.

Treatment: Small kidney stones may pass on their own with increased fluid intake. The doctor may prescribe pain medication to help manage discomfort during this process. For larger stones, procedures like shock wave lithotripsy, ureteroscopy, or surgery might be required to break or remove the stone.\n\n4. Prevention: Encourage your child to drink plenty of water to help prevent kidney stones. In some cases, dietary modifications or medication may be recommended to reduce the risk of recurrence.\n\n5. Follow-up: Schedule follow-up appointments with the healthcare provider to monitor your child's progress and ensure that the stone has passed.\n\nRemember, it's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment.",
        "original_answer": "Families may benefit from meeting with a dietitian to learn how dietary management can help in preventing stones. Depending on the underlying cause of the stone formation, medications may be necessary to prevent recurrent stones. Dietary changes and medications may be required for a long term or, quite often, for life. Some common changes include the following:\n                \n- Children who tend to make calcium oxalate stones or have hypercalciuria should eat a regular amount of dietary calcium and limit salt intake. A thiazide diuretic medication may be given to some children to reduce the amount of calcium leaking into the urine.  - Children who have large amounts of oxalate in the urine may need to limit foods high in oxalate, such as chocolate, peanut butter, and dark-colored soft drinks.  - Children who form uric acid or cystine stones may need extra potassium citrate or potassium carbonate in the form of a pill or liquid medication. Avoiding foods high in purinessuch as meat, fish, and shellfishmay also help prevent uric acid stones.",

        "original_answer": "- A kidney stone is a solid piece of material that forms in a kidney when some substances that are normally found in the urine become highly concentrated.  - Kidney stones occur in infants, children, and teenagers from all races and ethnicities.  - Kidney stones in children are diagnosed using a combination of urine, blood, and imaging tests.  - The treatment for a kidney stone usually depends on its size and composition as well as whether it is causing symptoms of pain or obstructing the urinary tract.  - Small stones usually pass through the urinary tract without treatment. Still, children will often require pain control and encouragement to drink lots of fluids to help move the stone along.  - Children with larger stones, or stones that block urine flow and cause great pain, may need to be hospitalized for more urgent treatment.  - Hospital treatments may include shock wave lithotripsy (SWL), removal of the stone with a ureteroscope, lithotripsy with a ureteroscope, or percutaneous nephrolithotomy.   - To prevent recurrent kidney stones, health care providers and their patients must understand what is causing the stones to form.  - In all circumstances, children should drink plenty of fluids to keep the urine diluted and flush away substances that could form kidney stones. Urine should be almost clear.",

        "original_answer": "Urinary incontinence is the loss of bladder control, which results in the accidental loss of urine. A child with UI may not stay dry during the day or night. Some UI is caused by a health problem such as\n                \n- a urinary tract infection (UTI)  - diabetes, a condition where blood glucose, also called blood sugar, is too high  - kidney problems  - nerve problems  - constipation, a condition in which a child has fewer than two bowel movements a week and stools can be hard, dry, small, and difficult to pass  - obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), a condition in which breathing is interrupted during sleep, often because of inflamed or enlarged tonsils  - a structural problem in the urinary tract\n                \nMost of the time, the exact cause of UI is not known, but it is often the result of more than one factor.\n                \nAlthough UI affects many children, it usually disappears naturally over time. UI after age 3the age when most children achieve daytime drynessmay cause great distress and embarrassment. Many children experience occasional UI, and treatment is available for most children who have a hard time controlling their bladder. Thus, caregivers of children who wet the bed or have accidents during the day should approach this problem with understanding and patience.\n                \nThe age at which children achieve dryness varies. Wetting in younger children is common and not considered UI, so daytime UI is not usually diagnosed until age 5 or 6, and nighttime UI is not usually diagnosed until age 7.\n                \nEnuresis   Urinary incontinence is also called enuresis. Types of enuresis include the following:   - Primary enuresis is wetting in a child who has never been consistently dry.   - Secondary enuresis is wetting that begins after at least 6 months of dryness.   - Nocturnal enuresis is wetting that usually occurs during sleep, also called nighttime UI.   - Diurnal enuresis is wetting when awake, also called daytime UI.",

In rare cases, a structural problem with the urinary tract.\n\nIt's important to note that urinary incontinence is not a result of laziness or deliberate misbehavior. If your child is experiencing this issue, it's recommended to consult with a healthcare professional for a proper evaluation and treatment plan.",
        "original_answer": "The exact cause of most cases of nighttime UI is not known. Though a few cases are caused by structural problems in the urinary tract, most cases probably result from a mix of factors including slower physical development, an overproduction of urine at night, and the inability to recognize bladder filling when asleep. Nighttime UI has also been associated with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), OSA, and anxiety. Children also may inherit genes from one or both parents that make them more likely to have nighttime UI.\n                \nSlower Physical Development\n                \nBetween the ages of 5 and 10, bedwetting may be the result of a small bladder capacity, long sleeping periods, and underdevelopment of the bodys alarms that signal a full or emptying bladder. This form of UI fades away as the bladder grows and the natural alarms become operational.\n                \nOverproduction of Urine at Night\n                \nThe body produces antidiuretic hormone (ADH), a natural chemical that slows down the production of urine. More ADH is produced at night so the need to urinate lessens. If the body does not produce enough ADH at night, the production of urine may not slow down, leading to bladder overfilling. If a child does not sense the bladder filling and awaken to urinate, wetting will occur.\n                \nStructural Problems\n                \nA small number of UI cases are caused by physical problems in the urinary tract. Rarely, a blocked bladder or urethra may cause the bladder to overfill and leak. Nerve damage associated with the birth defect spina bifida can cause UI. In these cases, UI can appear as a constant dribbling of urine.\n                \nAttention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder\n                \nChildren with ADHD are three times more likely to have nighttime UI than children without ADHD.2 The connection between ADHD and bedwetting has not been explained, but some experts theorize that both conditions are related to delays in central nervous system development.\n                \nObstructive Sleep Apnea\n                \nNighttime UI may be one sign of OSA. Other symptoms of OSA include snoring, mouth breathing, frequent ear and sinus infections, sore throat, choking, and daytime drowsiness. Experts believe that when the airway in people with OSA closes, a chemical may be released in the body that increases water production and inhibits the systems that regulate fluid volume. Successful treatment of OSA often resolves the associated nighttime UI.\n                \nAnxiety\n                \nAnxiety-causing events that occur between 2 and 4 years of agebefore total bladder control is achievedmight lead to primary enuresis. Anxiety experienced after age 4 might lead to secondary enuresis in children who have been dry for at least 6 months. Events that cause anxiety in children include physical or sexual abuse; unfamiliar social situations, such as moving or starting at a new school; and major family events such as the birth of a sibling, a death, or divorce.\n                \nUI itself is an anxiety-causing event. Strong bladder contractions resulting in daytime leakage can cause embarrassment and anxiety that lead to nighttime wetting.\n                \nGenetics\n                \nCertain genes have been found to contribute to UI. Children have a 30 percent chance of having nighttime UI if one parent was affected as a child. If both parents were affected, there is a 70 percent chance of bedwetting.1",

For example, children may not want to use the toilets at school or may not want to interrupt enjoyable activities, so they ignore the bodys signal of a full bladder. In these cases, the bladder can overfill and leak urine. In addition, these children often develop UTIs, leading to an irritated or overactive bladder.\n                \nFactors that may combine with infrequent voiding to produce daytime UI include\n                \n- small bladder capacity  - structural problems  - anxiety-causing events  - pressure from constipation  - drinks or foods that contain caffeine\n                \nSometimes, overly demanding toilet training may make children unable to relax the sphincters enough to completely empty the bladder.

        "original_answer": "Most UI fades away naturally as a child grows and develops and does not require treatment. When treatment is needed, options include bladder training and related strategies, moisture alarms, and medications.\n                \nGrowth and Development\n                \nAs children mature\n                \n- bladder capacity increases  - natural body alarms become activated  - an overactive bladder settles down  - production of ADH becomes normal  - response to the bodys signal that it is time to void improves\n                \nBladder Training and Related Strategies\n                \nBladder training consists of exercises to strengthen the bladder muscles to better control urination. Gradually lengthening the time between trips to the bathroom can also help by stretching the bladder so it can hold more urine. Additional techniques that may help control daytime UI include\n                \n- urinating on a scheduletimed voidingsuch as every 2 hours  - avoiding food or drinks with caffeine  - following suggestions for healthy urination, such as relaxing muscles and taking enough time to allow the bladder to empty completely\n                \nWaking children up to urinate can help decrease nighttime UI. Ensuring children drink enough fluids throughout the day so they do not drink a lot of fluids close to bedtime may also help. A health care provider can give guidance about how much a child needs to drink each day, as the amount depends on a childs age, physical activity, and other factors.\n                \nMoisture Alarms\n                \nAt night, moisture alarms can wake children when they begin to urinate. These devices use a water-sensitive pad connected to an alarm that sounds when moisture is first detected. A small pad can clip to the pajamas, or a larger pad can be placed on the bed. For the alarm to be effective, children must awaken as soon as the alarm goes off, stop the urine stream, and go to the bathroom. Children using moisture alarms may need to have someone sleep in the same room to help wake them up.\n                \nMedications\n                \nNighttime UI may be treated by increasing ADH levels. The hormone can be boosted by a synthetic version known as desmopressin (DDAVP), which is available in pill form, nasal spray, and nose drops. DDAVP is approved for use in children. Another medication, called imipramine (Tofranil), is also used to treat nighttime UI, though the way this medication prevents bedwetting is not known. Although both of these medications may help children achieve short-term success, relapse is common once the medication is withdrawn.\n                \nUI resulting from an overactive bladder may be treated with oxybutynin (Ditropan), a medication that helps calm the bladder muscle and control muscle spasms.",

In some cases, pain may be chronic and require ongoing treatment.\n\nIt is important to seek medical attention promptly if you suspect a perineal injury, as early treatment can help prevent these complications.",
        "original_answer": "Injury to the blood vessels, nerves, and muscles in the perineum can lead to complications such as\n                \n- bladder control problems  - sexual problems\n                \nBladder control problems. The nerves in the perineum carry signals from the bladder to the spinal cord and brain, telling the brain when the bladder is full. Those same nerves carry signals from the brain to the bladder and pelvic floor muscles, directing those muscles to hold or release urine. Injury to those nerves can block or interfere with the signals, causing the bladder to squeeze at the wrong time or not to squeeze at all. Damage to the pelvic floor muscles can cause bladder and bowel control problems.\n                \nSexual problems. The perineal nerves also carry signals between the genitals and the brain. Injury to those nerves can interfere with the sensations of sexual contact.\n                \nSignals from the brain direct the smooth muscles in the genitals to relax, causing greater blood flow into the penis. In men, damaged blood vessels can cause erectile dysfunction (ED), the inability to achieve or maintain an erection firm enough for sexual intercourse. An internal portion of the penis runs through the perineum and contains a section of the urethra. As a result, damage to the perineum may also injure the penis and urethra.",

Infections or inflammation: Certain infections or inflammatory conditions can cause swelling and pain in the perineal area, leading to injury.\n\nIt is important to seek medical attention if you experience perineal injury to ensure proper diagnosis and treatment.",
        "original_answer": "Common causes of acute perineal injury in males include\n                \n- perineal surgery  - straddle injuries  - sexual abuse  - impalement\n                \nPerineal Surgery\n                \nAcute perineal injury may result from surgical procedures that require an incision in the perineum:\n                \n- A prostatectomy is the surgical removal of the prostate to treat prostate cancer. The prostate, a walnut-shaped gland in men, surrounds the urethra at the neck of the bladder and supplies fluid that goes into semen. The surgeon chooses the location for the incision based on the patients physical characteristics, such as size and weight, and the surgeons experience and preferences. In one approach, called the radical perineal prostatectomy, the surgeon makes an incision between the scrotum and the anus. In a retropubic prostatectomy, the surgeon makes the incision in the lower abdomen, just above the penis. Both approaches can damage blood vessels and nerves affecting sexual function and bladder control.  - Perineal urethroplasty is surgery to repair stricture, or narrowing, of the portion of the urethra that runs through the perineum. Without this procedure, some men would not be able to pass urine. However, the procedure does require an incision in the perineum, which can damage blood vessels or nerves.  - Colorectal or anal cancer surgery can injure the perineum by cutting through some of the muscle around the anus to remove a tumor. One approach to anal cancer surgery involves making incisions in the abdomen and the perineum.\n                \nSurgeons try to avoid procedures that damage a persons blood vessels, perineal nerves, and muscles. However, sometimes a perineal incision may achieve the best angle to remove a life-threatening cancer.\n                \nPeople should discuss the risks of any planned surgery with their health care provider so they can make an informed decision and understand what to expect after the operation.\n                \nStraddle Injuries\n                \nStraddle injuries result from falls onto objects such as metal bars, pipes, or wooden rails, where the persons legs are on either side of the object and the perineum strikes the object forcefully. These injuries include motorcycle and bike riding accidents, saddle horn injuries during horseback riding, falls on playground equipment such as monkey bars, and gymnastic accidents on an apparatus such as the parallel bars or pommel horse.\n                \nIn rare situations, a blunt injury to the perineum may burst a blood vessel inside the erectile tissue of the penis, causing a persistent partial erection that can last for days to years. This condition is called high-flow priapism. If not treated, ED may result.\n                \nSexual Abuse\n                \nForceful and inappropriate sexual contact can result in perineal injury. When health care providers evaluate injuries in the genital area, they should consider the possibility of sexual abuse, even if the person or family members say the injury is the result of an accident such as a straddle injury. The law requires that health care providers report cases of sexual abuse that come to their attention. The person and family members should understand the health care provider may ask some uncomfortable questions about the circumstances of the injury.\n                \nImpalement\n                \nImpalement injuries may involve metal fence posts, rods, or weapons that pierce the perineum. Impalement is rare, although it may occur where moving equipment and pointed tools are in use, such as on farms or construction sites. Impalement can also occur as the result of a fall, such as from a tree or playground equipment, onto something sharp. Impalement injuries are most common in combat situations. If an impalement injury pierces the skin and muscles, the injured person needs immediate medical attention to minimize blood loss and repair the injury.",

        "original_answer": "Chronic perineal injury most often results from a job-or sport-related practicesuch as bike, motorcycle, or horseback ridingor a long-term condition such as chronic constipation.\n                \nBike Riding\n                \nSitting on a narrow, saddle-style bike seatwhich has a protruding nose in the frontplaces far more pressure on the perineum than sitting in a regular chair. In a regular chair, the flesh and bone of the buttocks partially absorb the pressure of sitting, and the pressure occurs farther toward the back than on a bike seat. The straddling position on a narrow seat pinches the perineal blood vessels and nerves, possibly causing blood vessel and nerve damage over time. Research shows wider, noseless seats reduce perineal pressure.1\n                \nOccasional bike riding for short periods of time may pose no risk. However, men who ride bikes several hours a weeksuch as competitive bicyclists, bicycle couriers, and bicycle patrol officershave a significantly higher risk of developing mild to severe ED.2 The ED may be caused by repetitive pressure on blood vessels, which constricts them and results in plaque buildup in the vessels.\n                \nOther activities that involve riding saddle-style include motorcycle and horseback riding. Researchers have studied bike riding more extensively than these other activities; however, the few studies published regarding motorcycle and horseback riding suggest motorcycle riding increases the risk of ED and urinary symptoms.3 Horseback riding appears relatively safe in terms of chronic injury,4 although the action of bouncing up and down, repeatedly striking the perineum, has the potential for causing damage.\n                \nConstipation\n                \nConstipation is defined as having a bowel movement fewer than three times per week. People with constipation usually have hard, dry stools that are small in size and difficult to pass. Some people with constipation need to strain to pass stools. This straining creates internal pressure that squeezes the perineum and can damage the perineal blood vessels and nerves. More information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Constipation.",

This condition results in a hyperactive thyroid state, known as hyperthyroidism. Common symptoms include anxiety, tremors, heat intolerance, weight loss, and bulging eyes (a condition called Graves' ophthalmopathy). Treatment options may include anti-thyroid medications, beta blockers, radioactive iodine therapy, or surgery to remove the thyroid gland.",
        "original_answer": "Graves disease, also known as toxic diffuse goiter, is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism in the United States. Hyperthyroidism is a disorder that occurs when the thyroid gland makes more thyroid hormone than the body needs.\n                \nThe Thyroid\n                \nThe thyroid is a 2-inch-long, butterfly-shaped gland in the front of the neck below the larynx, or voice box. The thyroid makes two thyroid hormones, triiodothyronine (T3 ) and thyroxine (T4 ). T3 is made from T4 and is the more active hormone, directly affecting the tissues. Thyroid hormones circulate throughout the body in the bloodstream and act on virtually every tissue and cell in the body.\n                \nThyroid hormones affect metabolism, brain development, breathing, heart and nervous system functions, body temperature, muscle strength, skin dryness, menstrual cycles, weight, and cholesterol levels. Hyperthyroidism causes many of the bodys functions to speed up.\n                \nThyroid hormone production is regulated by another hormone called thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), which is made by the pituitary gland in the brain. When thyroid hormone levels in the blood are low, the pituitary releases more TSH. When thyroid hormone levels are high, the pituitary responds by decreasing TSH production.\n                \n\n                \nAutoimmune Disorder\n                \nGraves disease is an autoimmune disorder. Normally, the immune system protects the body from infection by identifying and destroying bacteria, viruses, and other potentially harmful foreign substances. But in autoimmune diseases, the immune system attacks the bodys own cells and organs.\n                \nWith Graves disease, the immune system makes an antibody called thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin (TSI)sometimes called TSH receptor antibodythat attaches to thyroid cells. TSI mimics TSH and stimulates the thyroid to make too much thyroid hormone. Sometimes the TSI antibody instead blocks thyroid hormone production, leading to conflicting symptoms that may make correct diagnosis more difficult.",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Graves' disease is typically diagnosed through a combination of physical examination, medical history, and diagnostic tests. During the physical examination, the doctor may look for signs such as a goiter (enlarged thyroid gland), eye bulging (exophthalmos), or a rapid heart rate. They may also check for tremors, warm skin, and moist skin.\n\nIn addition to the physical examination, the doctor will also take a medical history to determine if the patient has any symptoms associated with Graves' disease, such as weight loss, anxiety, or fatigue.\n\nDiagnostic tests that may be used to confirm the diagnosis of Graves' disease include:\n\n1. Thyroid function tests: These blood tests measure the levels of thyroid hormones in the body. High levels of thyroid hormones may indicate an overactive thyroid gland, which is a common symptom of Graves' disease.\n2. Radioactive iodine uptake (RAIU) test: This test measures how much iodine the thyroid gland absorbs. A high uptake of iodine may indicate an overactive thyroid gland, which is consistent with Graves' disease.\n3. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) receptor antibody test: This blood test measures the levels of TSH receptor antibodies in the body. High levels of these antibodies may indicate Graves' disease.\n4. Imaging tests: Imaging tests such as a thyroid scan or ultrasound may be used to visualize the thyroid gland and assess its size and structure.\n\nIt is important to note that a diagnosis of Graves' disease should be made by a qualified healthcare professional. If you are experiencing symptoms associated with Graves' disease, it is important to speak with your doctor for proper diagnosis and treatment.",
        "original_answer": "Health care providers can sometimes diagnose Graves disease based only on a physical examination and a medical history. Blood tests and other diagnostic tests, such as the following, then confirm the diagnosis.\n                \nTSH test. The ultrasensitive TSH test is usually the first test performed. This test detects even tiny amounts of TSH in the blood and is the most accurate measure of thyroid activity available.\n                \nT3 and T4 test. Another blood test used to diagnose Graves disease measures T3 and T4 levels. In making a diagnosis, health care providers look for below-normal levels of TSH, normal to elevated levels of T4, and elevated levels of T3.\n                \nBecause the combination of low TSH and high T3 and T4 can occur with other thyroid problems, health care providers may order other tests to finalize the diagnosis. The following two tests use small, safe doses of radioactive iodine because the thyroid uses iodine to make thyroid hormone.\n                \nRadioactive iodine uptake test. This test measures the amount of iodine the thyroid collects from the bloodstream. High levels of iodine uptake can indicate Graves disease.\n                \nThyroid scan. This scan shows how and where iodine is distributed in the thyroid. With Graves disease the entire thyroid is involved, so the iodine shows up throughout the gland. Other causes of hyperthyroidism such as nodulessmall lumps in the glandshow a different pattern of iodine distribution.\n                \nTSI test. Health care providers may also recommend the TSI test, although this test usually isnt necessary to diagnose Graves disease. This test, also called a TSH antibody test, measures the level of TSI in the blood. Most people with Graves disease have this antibody, but people whose hyperthyroidism is caused by other conditions do not.\n                \nMore information about testing for thyroid problems is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Thyroid Tests.",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Graves' disease is an autoimmune disorder that causes the thyroid gland to produce too much thyroid hormone, leading to a condition called hyperthyroidism. Here are some common treatment options:\n\n1. Antithyroid medications: These drugs, such as methimazole and propylthiouracil, can help reduce the production of thyroid hormones.\n\n2. Beta blockers: These medications can help manage symptoms of hyperthyroidism, such as rapid heart rate, tremors, and anxiety.\n\n3. Radioactive iodine therapy: This treatment involves swallowing a small pill that destroys the thyroid gland's ability to produce hormones.\n\n4. Surgery: In some cases, the thyroid gland may be surgically removed, a procedure called thyroidectomy.\n\n5. Lifestyle changes: Avoiding caffeine, getting enough rest, and practicing stress management techniques can also help manage symptoms.\n\nIt's important to note that treatment should be individualized based on the patient's age, overall health, and personal preferences. Regular follow-up with a healthcare provider is essential to monitor the effectiveness of treatment and manage any potential side effects.",
        "original_answer": "People with Graves disease have three treatment options: radioiodine therapy, medications, and thyroid surgery. Radioiodine therapy is the most common treatment for Graves disease in the United States. Graves disease is often diagnosed and treated by an endocrinologista doctor who specializes in the bodys hormone- secreting glands.\n                \nRadioiodine Therapy\n                \nIn radioiodine therapy, patients take radioactive iodine-131 by mouth. Because the thyroid gland collects iodine to make thyroid hormone, it will collect the radioactive iodine from the bloodstream in the same way. Iodine-131stronger than the radioactive iodine used in diagnostic testsgradually destroys the cells that make up the thyroid gland but does not affect other body tissues.\n                \nMany health care providers use a large enough dose of iodine-131 to shut down the thyroid completely, but some prefer smaller doses to try to bring hormone production into the normal range. More than one round of radioiodine therapy may be needed. Results take time and people undergoing this treatment may not notice improvement in symptoms for several weeks or months.\n                \nPeople with GO should talk with a health care provider about any risks associated with radioactive iodine treatments. Several studies suggest radioiodine therapy can worsen GO in some people. Other treatments, such as prescription steroids, may prevent this complication.\n                \nAlthough iodine-131 is not known to cause birth defects or infertility, radioiodine therapy is not used in pregnant women or women who are breastfeeding. Radioactive iodine can be harmful to the fetus thyroid and can be passed from mother to child in breast milk. Experts recommend that women wait a year after treatment before becoming pregnant.\n                \nAlmost everyone who receives radioactive iodine treatment eventually develops hypothyroidism, which occurs when the thyroid does not make enough thyroid hormone. People with hypothyroidism must take synthetic thyroid hormone, a medication that replaces their natural thyroid hormone.\n                \nMedications\n                \nBeta blockers. Health care providers may prescribe a medication called a beta blocker to reduce many of the symptoms of hyperthyroidism, such as tremors, rapid heartbeat, and nervousness. But beta blockers do not stop thyroid hormone production.\n                \nAnti-thyroid medications. Health care providers sometimes prescribe anti-thyroid medications as the only treatment for Graves disease. Anti-thyroid medications interfere with thyroid hormone production but dont usually have permanent results. Use of these medications requires frequent monitoring by a health care provider. More often, anti-thyroid medications are used to pretreat patients before surgery or radioiodine therapy, or they are used as supplemental treatment after radioiodine therapy.\n                \nAnti-thyroid medications can cause side effects in some people, including\n                \n- allergic reactions such as rashes and itching  - a decrease in the number of white blood cells in the body, which can lower a persons resistance to infection  - liver failure, in rare cases\n                \nIn the United States, health care providers prescribe the anti-thyroid medication methimazole (Tapazole, Northyx) for most types of hyperthyroidism.\n                \nAnti-thyroid medications and pregnancy. Because pregnant and breastfeeding women cannot receive radioiodine therapy, they are usually treated with an anti-thyroid medication instead. However, experts agree that women in their first trimester of pregnancy should probably not take methimazole due to the rare occurrence of damage to the fetus.\n                \nAnother anti-thyroid medication, propylthiouracil (PTU), is available for women in this stage of pregnancy or for women who are allergic to or intolerant of methimazole and have no other treatment options. Health care providers may prescribe PTU for the first trimester of pregnancy and switch to methimazole for the second and third trimesters.\n                \nSome women are able to stop taking anti-thyroid medications in the last 4 to 8 weeks of pregnancy due to the remission of hyperthyroidism that occurs during pregnancy. However, these women should continue to be monitored for recurrence of thyroid problems following delivery.\n                \nStudies have shown that mothers taking anti-thyroid medications may safely breastfeed. However, they should take only moderate doses, less than 1020 milligrams daily, of the anti-thyroid medication methimazole. Doses should be divided and taken after feedings, and the infants should be monitored for side effects.2\n                \nWomen requiring higher doses of the anti-thyroid medication to control hyperthyroidism should not breastfeed.\n                \n2Ogunyemi DA.

Accessed April 10, 2012.\n                \nStop your anti-thyroid medication and call your health care provider right away if you develop any of the following while taking anti-thyroid medications:   - fatigue   - weakness   - vague abdominal pain   - loss of appetite   - skin rash or itching   - easy bruising   - yellowing of the skin or whites of the eyes, called jaundice   - persistent sore throat   - fever\n                \nThyroid Surgery\n                \nSurgery is the least-used option for treating Graves disease. Sometimes surgery may be used to treat\n                \n- pregnant women who cannot tolerate anti-thyroid medications  - people suspected of having thyroid cancer, though Graves disease does not cause cancer  - people for whom other forms of treatment are not successful\n                \nBefore surgery, the health care provider may prescribe anti-thyroid medications to temporarily bring a patients thyroid hormone levels into the normal range. This presurgical treatment prevents a condition called thyroid storma sudden, severe worsening of symptomsthat can occur when hyperthyroid patients have general anesthesia.\n                \nWhen surgery is used, many health care providers recommend the entire thyroid be removed to eliminate the chance that hyperthyroidism will return. If the entire thyroid is removed, lifelong thyroid hormone medication is necessary.\n                \nAlthough uncommon, certain problems can occur in thyroid surgery. The parathyroid glands can be damaged because they are located very close to the thyroid. These glands help control calcium and phosphorous levels in the body. Damage to the laryngeal nerve, also located close to the thyroid, can lead to voice changes or breathing problems.\n                \nBut when surgery is performed by an experienced surgeon, less than 1 percent of patients have permanent complications.1 People who need help finding a surgeon can contact one of the organizations listed under For More Information.\n                \nEye Care\n                \nThe eye problems associated with Graves disease may not improve following thyroid treatment, so the two problems are often treated separately.\n                \nEye drops can relieve dry, gritty, irritated eyesthe most common of the milder symptoms. If pain and swelling occur, health care providers may prescribe a steroid such as prednisone. Other medications that suppress the immune response may also provide relief.\n                \nSpecial lenses for glasses can help with light sensitivity and double vision. People with eye symptoms may be advised to sleep with their head elevated to reduce eyelid swelling. If the eyelids do not fully close, taping them shut at night can help prevent dry eyes.\n                \nIn more severe cases, external radiation may be applied to the eyes to reduce inflammation. Like other types of radiation treatment, the benefits are not immediate; most people feel relief from symptoms 1 to 2 months after treatment.\n                \nSurgery may be used to improve bulging of the eyes and correct the vision changes caused by pressure on the optic nerve. A procedure called orbital decompression makes the eye socket bigger and gives the eye room to sink back to a more normal position. Eyelid surgery can return retracted eyelids to their normal position.",

The narrowing of the renal artery can lead to decreased blood flow to the kidneys, causing the release of hormones that increase blood pressure.\n\n2. Kidney damage or failure: If left untreated, renal artery stenosis can lead to kidney damage or even kidney failure. This is due to the decreased blood flow and oxygen supply to the kidneys.\n\n3. Fluid and electrolyte imbalances: Decreased kidney function can lead to an imbalance of fluids and electrolytes in the body, which can cause symptoms such as swelling, muscle cramps, and heart rhythm abnormalities.\n\n4. Heart disease: The hormonal changes that occur with renal artery stenosis can also increase the risk of heart disease, including heart attack and stroke.\n\n5. Decreased kidney function: Over time, the decreased blood flow to the kidneys can lead to decreased kidney function, which can affect the body's ability to filter waste and toxins from the blood.\n\nIt is important to seek medical attention if you experience symptoms of renal artery stenosis, such as high blood pressure that is difficult to control, decreased kidney function, or fluid and electrolyte imbalances.

Imaging tests: These may include Doppler ultrasound, CT angiography, or magnetic resonance angiography to visualize the renal arteries and assess blood flow.\n3. Blood tests: These can help evaluate kidney function and detect any underlying conditions.\n4. Renal function tests: These tests, such as measuring creatinine levels, can help assess how well the kidneys are working.\n5. In some cases, a procedure called renal artery angiography may be performed to get a more detailed view of the renal arteries.\n\nIt is important to consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment.",
        "original_answer": "A health care provider can diagnose RAS by listening to the abdomen with a stethoscope and performing imaging tests. When blood flows through a narrow artery, it sometimes makes a whooshing sound, called a bruit. The health care provider may place a stethoscope on the front or the side of the abdomen to listen for this sound. The absence of this sound, however, does not exclude the possibility of RAS.\n                \nIn some cases, RAS is found when a person has a test for another reason. For example, a health care provider may find RAS during a coronary angiogram for diagnosis of heart problems. A coronary angiogram is a procedure that uses a special dye, called contrast medium, and x rays to see how blood flows through the heart.\n                \nThe following imaging tests are used to diagnose RAS:\n                \n- Duplex ultrasound. Duplex ultrasound combines traditional ultrasound with Doppler ultrasonography. Traditional ultrasound uses a device, called a transducer, that bounces safe, painless sound waves off organs to create an image of their structure. Doppler ultrasonography records sound waves reflected off of moving objects, such as blood, to measure their speed and other aspects of how they flow. The procedure is performed in a health care providers office, outpatient center, or hospital by a specially trained technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologista doctor who specializes in medical imaging. Anesthesia is not needed. The images can show blockage in the renal artery or blood moving through nearby arteries at a lower-than-normal speed. Ultrasound is noninvasive and low cost.  - Catheter angiogram. A catheter angiogram, also called a traditional angiogram, is a special kind of x ray in which a thin, flexible tube called a catheter is threaded through the large arteries, often from the groin, to the artery of interestin this case, the renal artery. The procedure is performed in a hospital or outpatient center by a radiologist. Anesthesia is not needed though a sedative may be given to lessen anxiety during the procedure. Contrast medium is injected through the catheter so the renal artery shows up more clearly on the x ray. Catheter angiogram is the gold standard for diagnosing RAS due to the high quality of the image produced. In addition, severe RAS can be treated during the same visit. However, a catheter angiogram is an invasive procedure, and a person may have side effects from the sedative or contrast medium or may have bleeding or injury to the artery from the catheter. The procedure is also more expensive than other imaging tests.  - Computerized tomographic angiography (CTA) scan. CTA scans use a combination of x rays and computer technology to create images. The procedure is performed in an outpatient center or hospital by an x-ray technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologist. Anesthesia is not needed. Contrast medium is injected into a vein in the persons arm to better see the structure of the arteries. CTA scans require the person to lie on a table that slides into a tunnel-shaped device where the x rays are taken. CTA scans are less invasive than catheter angiograms and take less time. However, the risks from the x-ray radiation still exist, and the test often requires more contrast medium than a catheter angiogram, so it may not be recommended for a person with poor kidney function.  - Magnetic resonance angiogram (MRA). MRA uses radio waves and magnets to produce detailed pictures of the bodys internal organs and soft tissues without using x rays. The procedure is performed in an outpatient center or hospital by an x-ray technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologist. Anesthesia is not needed though light sedation may be used for people with a fear of confined spaces. Contrast medium may be injected into a vein in the persons arm to better see the structure of the arteries. With most MRA scans, the person lies on a table that slides into a tunnel-shaped device that may be open ended or closed at one end; some newer machines are designed to allow the person to lie in a more open space. In addition to providing high-quality images noninvasively, MRA can provide a functional assessment of blood flow and organ function. However, the use of contrast medium for an MRA is not advised for people with poor kidney function because of the risk of complications to the skin and other organs if the kidneys do not remove the contrast medium well enough.",

Medications: Medications may be used to lower blood pressure, reduce cholesterol levels, prevent blood clots, and improve blood flow to the kidneys.\n3. Angioplasty and stenting: In this procedure, a catheter is inserted through a small incision in the groin and guided to the renal artery. A balloon is then inflated to widen the artery, and a stent may be placed to keep the artery open.\n4. Bypass surgery: In this procedure, a piece of a blood vessel from another part of the body is used to create a new path for blood to flow around the blocked artery.\n\nThe best treatment for renal artery stenosis depends on the severity of the blockage, the patient's overall health, and other factors. It is important to work closely with a healthcare provider to determine the most appropriate treatment plan.",
        "original_answer": "Treatment for RAS includes lifestyle changes, medications, and surgery and aims to\n                \n- prevent RAS from getting worse  - treat RVH  - relieve the blockage of the renal arteries\n                \nRAS that has not led to RVH or caused a significant blockage of the artery may not need treatment. RAS that needs to be treated, also called critical RAS, is defined by the American Heart Association as a reduction by more than 60 percent in the diameter of the renal artery.1 However, health care providers are not exactly sure what degree of blockage will cause significant problems.\n                \nLifestyle Changes\n                \nThe first step in treating RAS is making lifestyle changes that promote healthy blood vessels throughout the body, including the renal arteries. The best ways to keep plaque from building up in the arteries are to exercise, maintain a healthy body weight, and choose healthy foods. People who smoke should quit to help protect their kidneys and other internal organs.\n                \nMedications\n                \nPeople with RVH may need to take medications thatwhen taken as prescribed by their health care providerlower blood pressure and can also significantly slow the progression of kidney disease. Two types of blood pressure-lowering medications, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), have proven effective in slowing the progression of kidney disease. Many people require two or more medications to control their blood pressure. In addition to an ACE inhibitor or an ARB, a diuretica medication that helps the kidneys remove fluid from the bloodmay be prescribed. Beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, and other blood pressure medications may also be needed. Some people with RAS cannot take an ACE inhibitor or ARB due to the effects on the kidneys. People with RAS who are prescribed an ACE inhibitor or ARB should have their kidney function checked within a few weeks of starting the medication.\n                \nA cholesterol-lowering medication to prevent plaque from building up in the arteries and a blood-thinner, such as aspirin, to help the blood flow more easily through the arteries may also be prescribed.\n                \nSurgery\n                \nAlthough surgery has been used in the past for treatment of RAS due to atherosclerosis, recent studies have not shown improved outcomes with surgery compared with medication. However, surgery may be recommended for people with RAS caused by FMD or RAS that does not improve with medication. Different types of surgery for RAS include the following. The procedures are performed in a hospital by a vascular surgeona doctor who specializes in repairing blood vessels. Anesthesia is needed.\n                \n- Angioplasty and stenting. Angioplasty is a procedure in which a catheter is put into the renal artery, usually through the groin, just as in a catheter angiogram. In addition, for angioplasty, a tiny balloon at the end of the catheter can be inflated to flatten the plaque against the artery wall. A small mesh tube, called a stent, may then be positioned inside the artery to keep plaque flattened and the artery open. People with RAS caused by FMD may be successfully treated with angioplasty alone, while angioplasty with stenting has a better outcome for people with RAS caused by atherosclerosis.  - Endarterectomy or bypass surgery. In an endarterectomy, the plaque is cleaned out of the artery, leaving the inside lining smooth and clear. To create a bypass, a vein or synthetic tube is used to connect the kidney to the aorta. This new path serves as an alternate route for blood to flow around the blocked artery into the kidney. These procedures are not performed as often as in the past due to a high risk of complications during and after the procedure.",

Controlling blood pressure through healthy food choices and regular physical activity can delay or prevent the development of CKD.\n                \nBlood pressure is expressed as two numbers. The top number represents the force of the blood pushing against the artery walls when the heart beats. The lower number represents the pressure between beats.

People with CKD should try to keep their blood pressure below 140/90 mmHg.\n                \nFollowing a meal plan can help control blood pressure and protect the kidneys. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute supported research that compared a typical American diet with the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating plan, which is lower in saturated fat, cholesterol, and total fat and emphasizes eating fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy foods. People who followed the DASH eating plan were able to reduce their blood pressure much more than those who ate a typical diet. The DASH eating plan also includes whole grain products, fish, poultry, and nuts. Limiting sodium, or salt, is another important feature of the plan. A dietitian can help find low-salt or salt-free alternatives to foods that are high in salt.",

Imaging tests: These can include an ultrasound, CT scan, or MRI to assess the size and structure of the kidneys.\n\n5. Kidney biopsy: This is the most definitive way to diagnose lupus nephritis. A small sample of kidney tissue is removed and examined for signs of inflammation and damage.\n\nIt's important to note that only a healthcare professional can diagnose a medical condition. If you suspect you have lupus nephritis, you should consult with a healthcare provider.",
        "original_answer": "Lupus nephritis is diagnosed through urine and blood tests and a kidney biopsy:\n                \n- Urinalysis. Urinalysis is testing of a urine sample. The urine sample is collected in a special container in a health care providers office or commercial facility and can be tested in the same location or sent to a lab for analysis. For the test, a nurse or technician places a strip of chemically treated paper, called a dipstick, into the urine. Patches on the dipstick change color when blood or protein is present. A high number of red blood cells or high levels of protein in the urine indicate kidney damage.  - Blood test. A blood test involves drawing blood at a health care providers office or commercial facility and sending the sample to a lab for analysis. The blood test can show high levels of creatinine, a waste product of normal muscle breakdown excreted by the kidneys, which increases when the kidneys are not functioning well.   - Biopsy. A biopsy is a procedure that involves taking a small piece of kidney tissue for examination with a microscope. The biopsy is performed by a health care provider in a hospital with light sedation and local anesthetic. The health care provider uses imaging techniques such as ultrasound or a computerized tomography scan to guide the biopsy needle into the kidney. The kidney tissue is examined in a lab by a pathologista doctor who specializes in diagnosing diseases. The test can confirm a diagnosis of lupus nephritis, determine how far the disease has progressed, and guide treatment. The American College of Rheumatology recommends biopsies for all people with evidence of active lupus nephritis that has not been previously treated.",

It's important to work closely with a nephrologist (kidney specialist) to determine the best treatment plan.",
        "original_answer": "Lupus nephritis is treated with medications that suppress the immune system, so it stops attacking and damaging the kidneys. Standard treatment includes a corticosteroid, usually prednisone, to reduce inflammation in the kidneys. An immunosuppressive medication, such as cyclophosphamide or mycophenolate mofetil, is typically used with prednisone. These medicationswhen taken as prescribed by a health care providerfurther decrease the activity of the immune system and block the bodys immune cells from attacking the kidneys directly or making antibodies that attack the kidneys. Antibodies are proteins made by the immune system to protect the body from foreign substances such as bacteria or viruses. Hydroxychloroquine, a medication for treating SLE, should also be prescribed or continued for people with lupus nephritis.\n                \nPeople with lupus nephritis that is causing high blood pressure may need to take medications that lower their blood pressure and can also significantly slow the progression of kidney disease. Two types of blood pressure lowering medications, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), have proven effective in slowing the progression of kidney disease. Many people require two or more medications to control their blood pressure. In addition to an ACE inhibitor or an ARB, a diuretica medication that helps the kidneys remove fluid from the bodymay be prescribed. Beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, and other blood pressure medications may also be needed.\n                \nBlood pressure is written with two numbers separated by a slash, 120/80, and is said as 120 over 80. The top number is called the systolic pressure and represents the pressure as the heart beats and pushes blood through the blood vessels. The bottom number is called the diastolic pressure and represents the pressure as blood vessels relax between heartbeats. High blood pressure is a systolic pressure of 140 or above or a diastolic pressure of 90 or above.2",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Lupus nephritis is a complication of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) that can affect the kidneys. Potential complications of lupus nephritis include:\n\n1. Renal failure: If left untreated, lupus nephritis can lead to kidney damage and eventually kidney failure.\n2. High blood pressure: Lupus nephritis can cause high blood pressure, which can increase the risk of heart disease and stroke.\n3. Anemia: Lupus nephritis can interfere with the production of red blood cells, leading to anemia.\n4. Proteinuria: Lupus nephritis can cause the kidneys to release too much protein into the urine, which can lead to swelling in the legs and feet.\n5. Infections: People with lupus nephritis are at an increased risk of infections due to the use of immunosuppressive medications.\n6. Bone health issues: Long-term use of corticosteroids to treat lupus nephritis can lead to bone loss and an increased risk of fractures.\n\nIt is important to work closely with a healthcare provider to manage lupus nephritis and reduce the risk of these complications.",
        "original_answer": "In many cases, treatment is effective in completely or partially controlling lupus nephritis, resulting in few, if any, further complications. However, even with treatment, 10 to 30 percent of people with lupus nephritis develop kidney failure, described as end-stage renal disease when treated with blood-filtering treatments called dialysis or a kidney transplant.3 Scientists cannot predict who will or will not respond to treatment. The most severe form of lupus nephritis is called diffuse proliferative nephritis. With this type of illness, the kidneys are inflamed, many white blood cells invade the kidneys, and kidney cells increase in number, which can cause such severe damage that scars form in the kidneys. Scars are difficult to treat, and kidney function often declines as more scars form. People with suspected lupus nephritis should get diagnosed and treated as early as possible to prevent such chronic, or long lasting, damage.\n                \nPeople with lupus nephritis are at a high risk for cancer, primarily B-cell lymphomaa type of cancer that begins in the cells of the immune system. They are also at a high risk for heart and blood vessel problems.",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Kidney disease in children, also known as pediatric kidney disease, refers to conditions that affect the proper functioning of the kidneys. The kidneys play a vital role in maintaining the body's balance by removing waste and excess fluids, releasing hormones to regulate blood pressure and red blood cell production, and controlling electrolyte levels.\n\nThere are several types of kidney disease that can affect children, including:\n\n1. Congenital anomalies: These are abnormalities that children are born with, such as obstructive uropathy, renal dysplasia, or polycystic kidney disease.\n2. Glomerulonephritis: This is a group of conditions that affect the glomeruli, the tiny filters in the kidneys that remove waste from the blood.\n3. Nephrotic syndrome: This is a condition that causes the kidneys to leak large amounts of protein into the urine, leading to swelling in the legs, ankles, and feet.\n4. Hemolytic uremic syndrome: This is a rare condition that occurs when red blood cells are destroyed and block the kidneys' filtering system.\n5. Lupus nephritis: This is a kidney disease that occurs in children with lupus, an autoimmune disorder that causes inflammation throughout the body.\n6. Inherited kidney diseases: These are genetic conditions that affect the kidneys, such as Alport syndrome or polycystic kidney disease.\n\nSymptoms of kidney disease in children can vary depending on the type and severity of the condition. Common symptoms include:\n\n* Swelling in the legs, ankles, or feet\n* Blood in the urine\n* Frequent urination or bedwetting\n* Fatigue or weakness\n* Loss of appetite or weight loss\n* Nausea or vomiting\n* High blood pressure\n\nIf you suspect your child has kidney disease, it is important to seek medical attention promptly. Treatment options depend on the type and severity of the condition, and may include medication, dietary changes, or dialysis. In some cases, a kidney transplant may be necessary.",
        "original_answer": "The kidneys are two bean-shaped organs, each about the size of a fist. They are located just below the rib cage, one on each side of the spine. Every day, the two kidneys filter about 120 to 150 quarts of blood to produce about 1 to 2 quarts of urine, composed of wastes and extra fluid. Children produce less urine than adults and the amount produced depends on their age. The kidneys work around the clock; a person does not control what they do. Ureters are the thin tubes of muscleone on each side of the bladderthat carry urine from each of the kidneys to the bladder. The bladder stores urine until the person finds an appropriate time and place to urinate.\n                \nThe kidney is not one large filter. Each kidney is made up of about a million filtering units called nephrons. Each nephron filters a small amount of blood. The nephron includes a filter, called a glomerulus, and a tubule. The nephrons work through a two-step process. The glomerulus lets fluid and waste products pass through it; however, it prevents blood cells and large molecules, mostly proteins, from passing. The filtered fluid then passes through the tubule, which changes the fluid by sending needed minerals back to the bloodstream and removing wastes. The final product becomes urine.\n                \nThe kidneys also control the level of minerals such as sodium, phosphorus, and potassium in the body, and produce an important hormone to prevent anemia. Anemia is a condition in which the number of red blood cells is less than normal, resulting in less oxygen carried to the bodys cells.",

        "original_answer": "Kidney disease in children can be caused by\n                \n- birth defects  - hereditary diseases  - infection  - nephrotic syndrome  - systemic diseases  - trauma  - urine blockage or reflux\n                \nFrom birth to age 4, birth defects and hereditary diseases are the leading causes of kidney failure. Between ages 5 and 14, kidney failure is most commonly caused by hereditary diseases, nephrotic syndrome, and systemic diseases. Between ages 15 and 19, diseases that affect the glomeruli are the leading cause of kidney failure, and hereditary diseases become less common.1\n                \nBirth Defects\n                \nA birth defect is a problem that happens while a baby is developing in the mothers womb. Birth defects that affect the kidneys include renal agenesis, renal dysplasia, and ectopic kidney, to name a few. These defects are abnormalities of size, structure, or position of the kidneys:\n                \n- renal agenesischildren born with only one kidney  - renal dysplasiachildren born with both kidneys, yet one does not function  - ectopic kidneychildren born with a kidney that is located below, above, or on the opposite side of its usual position\n                \nIn general, children with these conditions lead full, healthy lives. However, some children with renal agenesis or renal dysplasia are at increased risk for developing kidney disease.\n                \nHereditary Diseases\n                \nHereditary kidney diseases are illnesses passed from parent to child through the genes. One example is polycystic kidney disease (PKD), characterized by many grapelike clusters of fluid-filled cystsabnormal sacsthat make both kidneys larger over time. These cysts take over and destroy working kidney tissue. Another hereditary disease is Alport syndrome, which is caused by a mutation in a gene for a type of protein called collagen that makes up the glomeruli. The condition leads to scarring of the kidneys. Alport syndrome generally develops in early childhood and is more serious in boys than in girls. The condition can lead to hearing and vision problems in addition to kidney disease.\n                \nInfection\n                \nHemolytic uremic syndrome and acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis are kidney diseases that can develop in a child after an infection.\n                \n- Hemolytic uremic syndrome is a rare disease that is often caused by the Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacterium found in contaminated foods, such as meat, dairy products, and juice. Hemolytic uremic syndrome develops when E. coli bacteria lodged in the digestive tract make toxins that enter the bloodstream. The toxins start to destroy red blood cells and damage the lining of the blood vessels, including the glomeruli. Most children who get an E. coli infection have vomiting, stomach cramps, and bloody diarrhea for 2 to 3 days. Children who develop hemolytic uremic syndrome become pale, tired, and irritable. Hemolytic uremic syndrome can lead to kidney failure in some children.  - Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis can occur after an episode of strep throat or a skin infection. The Streptococcus bacterium does not attack the kidneys directly; instead, the infection may stimulate the immune system to overproduce antibodies. Antibodies are proteins made by the immune system. The immune system protects people from infection by identifying and destroying bacteria, viruses, and other potentially harmful foreign substances. When the extra antibodies circulate in the blood and finally deposit in the glomeruli, the kidneys can be damaged. Most cases of post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis develop 1 to 3 weeks after an untreated infection, though it may be as long as 6 weeks. Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis lasts only a brief time and the kidneys usually recover. In a few cases, kidney damage may be permanent.\n                \nNephrotic Syndrome\n                \nNephrotic syndrome is a collection of symptoms that indicate kidney damage. Nephrotic syndrome includes all of the following conditions:\n                \n- albuminuriawhen a persons urine contains an elevated level of albumin, a protein typically found in the blood  - hyperlipidemiahigher-than-normal fat and cholesterol levels in the blood  - edemaswelling, usually in the legs, feet, or ankles and less often in the hands or face  - hypoalbuminemialow levels of albumin in the blood\n                \nNephrotic syndrome in children can be caused by the following conditions:\n                \n- Minimal change disease is a condition characterized by damage to the glomeruli that can be seen only with an electron microscope, which shows tiny details better than any other type of microscope. The cause of minimal change disease is unknown; some health care providers think it may occur after allergic reactions, vaccinations, and viral infections.  - Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis is scarring in scattered regions of the kidney, typically limited to a small number of glomeruli.  - Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis is a group of autoimmune diseases that cause antibodies to build up on a membrane in the kidney. Autoimmune diseases cause the bodys immune system to attack the bodys own cells and organs.\n                \nSystemic Diseases\n                \nSystemic diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE or lupus) and diabetes, involve many organs or the whole body, including the kidneys:\n                \n- Lupus nephritis is kidney inflammation caused by SLE, which is an autoimmune disease.  - Diabetes leads to elevated levels of blood glucose, also called blood sugar, which scar the kidneys and increase the speed at which blood flows into the kidneys. Faster blood flow strains the glomeruli, decreasing their ability to filter blood, and raises blood pressure. Kidney disease caused by diabetes is called diabetic kidney disease. While diabetes is the number one cause of kidney failure in adults, it is an uncommon cause during childhood.\n                \nMore information about systemic kidney diseases is provided in the NIDDK health topics:\n                \n- Lupus Nephritis  - Kidney Disease of Diabetes\n                \nTrauma\n                \nTraumas such as burns, dehydration, bleeding, injury, or surgery can cause very low blood pressure, which decreases blood flow to the kidneys. Low blood flow can result in acute kidney failure.\n                \nUrine Blockage or Reflux\n                \nWhen a blockage develops between the kidneys and the urethra, urine can back up into the kidneys and cause damage. Refluxurine flowing from the bladder up to the kidneyhappens when the valve between the bladder and the ureter does not close all the way.",

The presence of albumin in urine is a sign that the kidneys may be damaged. Albumin in urine can be detected with a dipstick test performed on a urine sample. The urine sample is collected in a special container in a health care providers office or a commercial facility and can be tested in the same location or sent to a lab for analysis. With a dipstick test, a nurse or technician places a strip of chemically treated paper, called a dipstick, into the persons urine sample. Patches on the dipstick change color when albumin is present in urine.\n                \nUrine albumin-to-creatinine ratio.

A child may be referred to a pediatric nephrologista doctor who specializes in treating kidney diseases and kidney failure in childrenfor treatment.\n                \nChildren with a kidney disease that is causing high blood pressure may need to take medications to lower their blood pressure. Improving blood pressure can significantly slow the progression of kidney disease. The health care provider may prescribe\n                \n- angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, which help relax blood vessels and make it easier for the heart to pump blood  - angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), which help relax blood vessels and make it easier for the heart to pump blood  - diuretics, medications that increase urine output\n                \nMany children require two or more medications to control their blood pressure; other types of blood pressure medications may also be needed.\n                \nAs kidney function declines, children may need treatment for anemia and growth failure. Anemia is treated with a hormone called erythropoietin, which stimulates the bone marrow to produce red blood cells. Children with growth failure may need to make dietary changes and take food supplements or growth hormone injections.\n                \nChildren with kidney disease that leads to kidney failure must receive treatment to replace the work the kidneys do. The two types of treatment are dialysis and transplantation. More information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Treatment Methods for Kidney Failure in Children.\n                \nBirth Defects\n                \nChildren with renal agenesis or renal dysplasia should be monitored for signs of kidney damage. Treatment is not needed unless damage to the kidney occurs. More information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Solitary Kidney.\n                \nEctopic kidney does not need to be treated unless it causes a blockage in the urinary tract or damage to the kidney. When a blockage is present, surgery may be needed to correct the position of the kidney for better drainage of urine. If extensive kidney damage has occurred, surgery may be needed to remove the kidney. More information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Ectopic Kidney.\n                \nHereditary Diseases\n                \nChildren with PKD tend to have frequent urinary tract infections, which are treated with bacteria-fighting medications called antibiotics. PKD cannot be cured, so children with the condition receive treatment to slow the progression of kidney disease and treat the complications of PKD. More information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Polycystic Kidney Disease.\n                \nAlport syndrome also has no cure. Children with the condition receive treatment to slow disease progression and treat complications until the kidneys fail. More information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Glomerular Diseases.\n                \nInfection\n                \nTreatment for hemolytic uremic syndrome includes maintaining normal salt and fluid levels in the body to ease symptoms and prevent further problems. A child may need a transfusion of red blood cells delivered through an intravenous (IV) tube. Some children may need dialysis for a short time to take over the work the kidneys usually do. Most children recover completely with no long-term consequences. More information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome in Children.\n                \nChildren with post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis may be treated with antibiotics to destroy any bacteria that remain in the body and with medications to control swelling and high blood pressure. They may also need dialysis for a short period of time. More information about post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Glomerular Diseases.\n                \nNephrotic Syndrome\n                \nNephrotic syndrome due to minimal change disease can often be successfully treated with corticosteroids. Corticosteroids decrease swelling and reduce the activity of the immune system. The dosage of the medication is decreased over time. Relapses are common; however, they usually respond to treatment. Corticosteroids are less effective in treating nephrotic syndrome due to focal segmental glomerulosclerosis or membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis. Children with these conditions may be given other immunosuppressive medications in addition to corticosteroids. Immunosuppressive medications prevent the body from making antibodies. More information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Childhood Nephrotic Syndrome.\n                \nSystemic Diseases\n                \nLupus nephritis is treated with corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive medications. A child with lupus nephritis may also be treated with blood pressure-lowering medications. In many cases, treatment is effective in completely or partially controlling lupus nephritis. More information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Lupus Nephritis.\n                \nDiabetic kidney disease usually takes many years to develop. Children with diabetes can prevent or slow the progression of diabetic kidney disease by taking medications to control high blood pressure and maintaining normal blood glucose levels. More information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Kidney Disease of Diabetes.\n                \nTrauma\n                \nThe types of trauma described above can be medically treated, though dialysis may be needed for a short time until blood flow and blood pressure return to normal.\n                \nUrine Blockage and Reflux\n                \nTreatment for urine blockage depends on the cause and severity of the blockage. In some cases, the blockage goes away without treatment. For children who continue to have urine blockage, surgery may be needed to remove the obstruction and restore urine flow. After surgery, a small tube, called a stent, may be placed in the ureter or urethra to keep it open temporarily while healing occurs. More information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Urine Blockage in Newborns.\n                \nTreatment for reflux may include prompt treatment of urinary tract infections and long-term use of antibiotics to prevent infections until reflux goes away on its own. Surgery has also been used in certain cases. More information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Vesicoureteral Reflux.",

        "original_answer": "For children with CKD, learning about nutrition is vital because their diet can affect how well their kidneys work. Parents or guardians should always consult with their childs health care team before making any dietary changes. Staying healthy with CKD requires paying close attention to the following elements of a diet:\n                \n- Protein. Children with CKD should eat enough protein for growth while limiting high protein intake. Too much protein can put an extra burden on the kidneys and cause kidney function to decline faster. Protein needs increase when a child is on dialysis because the dialysis process removes protein from the childs blood. The health care team recommends the amount of protein needed for the child. Foods with protein include      - eggs    - milk    - cheese    - chicken    - fish    - red meats    - beans    - yogurt    - cottage cheese    - Sodium. The amount of sodium children need depends on the stage of their kidney disease, their age, and sometimes other factors. The health care team may recommend limiting or adding sodium and salt to the diet. Foods high in sodium include      - canned foods    - some frozen foods    - most processed foods    - some snack foods, such as chips and crackers    - Potassium. Potassium levels need to stay in the normal range for children with CKD, because too little or too much potassium can cause heart and muscle problems. Children may need to stay away from some fruits and vegetables or reduce the number of servings and portion sizes to make sure they do not take in too much potassium. The health care team recommends the amount of potassium a child needs. Low-potassium fruits and vegetables include      - apples    - cranberries    - strawberries    - blueberries    - raspberries    - pineapple    - cabbage    - boiled cauliflower    - mustard greens    - uncooked broccoli    - High-potassium fruits and vegetables include      - oranges    - melons    - apricots    - bananas    - potatoes    - tomatoes    - sweet potatoes    - cooked spinach    - cooked broccoli    - Phosphorus. Children with CKD need to control the level of phosphorus in their blood because too much phosphorus pulls calcium from the bones, making them weaker and more likely to break. Too much phosphorus also can cause itchy skin and red eyes. As CKD progresses, a child may need to take a phosphate binder with meals to lower the concentration of phosphorus in the blood. Phosphorus is found in high-protein foods. Foods with low levels of phosphorus include      - liquid nondairy creamer    - green beans    - popcorn    - unprocessed meats from a butcher    - lemon-lime soda    - root beer    - powdered iced tea and lemonade mixes    - rice and corn cereals    - egg white    - sorbet    - Fluids. Early in CKD, a childs damaged kidneys may produce either too much or too little urine, which can lead to swelling or dehydration. As CKD progresses, children may need to limit fluid intake. The health care provider will tell the child and parents or guardians the goal for fluid intake.\n                \nMore information is provided in the NIDDK health topics, Nutrition for Chronic Kidney Disease in Children and Kidney Failure: Eat Right to Feel Right on Hemodialysis.",

        "original_answer": "Type 1: Classical Distal RTA\n                \nType 1 is also called classical distal RTA. \"Distal,\" which means distant, refers to the point in the urine-forming tube of the kidney where the defect occursrelatively distant from the point where fluid from the blood enters the tiny tube, or tubule, that collects fluid and wastes to form urine.\n                \nThis disorder may be inherited as a primary disorder or may be one symptom of a disease that affects many parts of the body. Researchers have discovered abnormal genes responsible for the inherited forms of the disease. More often, however, classical distal RTA occurs as a result of systemic diseasesdiseases that affect many organ systemslike the autoimmune disorders Sjgren's syndrome and lupus, which also attack the distal tubule.\n                \nOther diseases and conditions associated with classical distal RTA include sickle cell anemia, hyperparathyroidism, hyperthyroidism, chronic active hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, a hereditary form of deafness, analgesic nephropathy, rejection of a transplanted kidney, renal medullary cystic disease, obstructive uropathy, and chronic urinary tract infections. Many of these conditions cause abnormal calcium deposits to build up in the kidney and impair distal tubule function.\n                \nA major consequence of classical distal RTA is a low blood potassium level. The level drops if the kidneys excrete too much potassium into urine instead of returning it to the blood supply. Because potassium helps regulate nerve and muscle health and heart rate, low levels can cause extreme weakness, irregular heartbeat, paralysis, and even death.\n                \nUntreated classical distal RTA causes growth retardation in children and progressive kidney and bone disease in adults. Restoring normal growth and preventing kidney stones are the major goals of therapy. If acidosis is corrected with sodium bicarbonate or sodium citrate, then low blood-potassium, salt depletion, and calcium leakage into urine will be corrected. This alkali therapy also helps decrease the development of kidney stones and stabilizes kidney function so kidney failure does not progress. Infants may need potassium supplements, but older children and adults rarely do because alkali therapy prevents the kidney from excreting potassium into the urine.\n                \nType 2: Proximal RTA\n                \nType 2 is also called proximal RTA. The word \"proximal,\" which means near, indicates that the defect is closer to the point where fluid and wastes from the blood enter the tubule.\n                \nThis form of RTA occurs most frequently in children as part of a disorder called Fanconi's syndrome. The features of Fanconi's syndrome include the abnormal excretion of glucose, amino acids, citrate, and phosphate into the urine, as well as vitamin D deficiency and low blood-potassium.\n                \nProximal RTA can also result from inherited disorders that disrupt the body's normal breakdown and use of nutrients. Examples include the rare disease cystinosis, in which cystine crystals are deposited in bones and other tissues; hereditary fructose intolerance; and Wilson disease.\n                \nProximal RTA also occurs in patients treated with ifosfamide, a drug used in chemotherapy. A few older drugssuch as acetazolamide or outdated tetracyclinecan also cause proximal RTA. In adults, proximal RTA may complicate diseases like multiple myeloma, or it may occur in people who experience chronic rejection of a transplanted kidney.\n                \nWhen possible, identifying and correcting the underlying causes are important steps in treating the acquired forms of proximal RTA. The diagnosis is based on the chemical analysis of blood and urine samples. Children with this disorder would likely receive large doses of an oral alkali, such as sodium bicarbonate or potassium citrate, to treat acidosis and prevent bone disorders, kidney stones, and growth failure. Correcting acidosis and low potassium levels restores normal growth patterns, allowing bone to mature while preventing further renal disease. Vitamin D supplements may also be needed to help prevent bone problems.\n                \nType 3\n                \nType 3 is rarely used as a classification because it is now thought to be a combination of type 1 and type 2.\n                \nType 4: Hyperkalemic RTA\n                \nType 4 is also called hyperkalemic RTA and is caused by a generalized transport abnormality of the distal tubule. The transport of electrolytes such as sodium, chloride, and potassium that normally occurs in the distal tubule is impaired. This form is distinguished from classical distal RTA and proximal RTA because it results in high levels of potassium in the blood instead of low levels. Either low potassiumhypokalemiaor high potassiumhyperkalemiacan be a problem because potassium is important in regulating heart rate.\n                \nType 4 RTA occurs when blood levels of the hormone aldosterone are low or when the kidneys do not respond to it. Aldosterone directs the kidneys to regulate the levels of sodium, potassium, and chloride in the blood. Type 4 RTA also occurs when the tubule transport of electrolytes such as sodium, chloride, and potassium is impaired due to an inherited disorder or the use of certain drugs.\n                \nDrugs that may cause type 4 RTA include\n                \n- diuretics used to treat congestive heart failure such as spironolactone or eplerenone  - blood pressure drugs called angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)  - the antibiotic trimethoprim  - the antibiotic pentamidine, which is used to treat pneumonia  - an agent called heparin that keeps blood from clotting  - a class of painkillers called nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)  - some immunosuppressive drugs used to prevent rejection\n                \nType 4 RTA may also result from diseases that alter kidney structure and function such as diabetic nephropathy, HIV/AIDS, Addison's disease, sickle cell disease, urinary tract obstruction, lupus, amyloidosis, removal or destruction of both adrenal glands, and kidney transplant rejection.\n                \nFor people who produce aldosterone but cannot use it, researchers have identified the genetic basis for their body's resistance to the hormone. To treat type 4 RTA successfully, patients may require alkaline agents to correct acidosis and medication to lower the potassium in their blood.\n                \nIf treated early, most people with any type of RTA will not develop permanent kidney failure. Therefore, the goal is early recognition and adequate therapy, which will need to be maintained and monitored throughout the person's lifetime.",

        "question_text": "What is (are) Renal Tubular Acidosis ?",
        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Renal Tubular Acidosis (RTA) is a group of conditions that affect the way your kidneys process blood waste. In RTA, your kidneys don't properly remove acids from your blood, which can lead to a variety of health problems. There are several types of RTA, but they all involve an imbalance of acid in the body. Symptoms can include fatigue, weakness, confusion, and, in severe cases, kidney failure. Treatment typically involves medications to help restore the proper acid-base balance in the body.",
        "original_answer": "Type 1: Classical Distal RTA\n                \nType 1 is also called classical distal RTA. \"Distal,\" which means distant, refers to the point in the urine-forming tube of the kidney where the defect occursrelatively distant from the point where fluid from the blood enters the tiny tube, or tubule, that collects fluid and wastes to form urine.\n                \nThis disorder may be inherited as a primary disorder or may be one symptom of a disease that affects many parts of the body. Researchers have discovered abnormal genes responsible for the inherited forms of the disease. More often, however, classical distal RTA occurs as a result of systemic diseasesdiseases that affect many organ systemslike the autoimmune disorders Sjgren's syndrome and lupus, which also attack the distal tubule.\n                \nOther diseases and conditions associated with classical distal RTA include sickle cell anemia, hyperparathyroidism, hyperthyroidism, chronic active hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, a hereditary form of deafness, analgesic nephropathy, rejection of a transplanted kidney, renal medullary cystic disease, obstructive uropathy, and chronic urinary tract infections. Many of these conditions cause abnormal calcium deposits to build up in the kidney and impair distal tubule function.\n                \nA major consequence of classical distal RTA is a low blood potassium level. The level drops if the kidneys excrete too much potassium into urine instead of returning it to the blood supply. Because potassium helps regulate nerve and muscle health and heart rate, low levels can cause extreme weakness, irregular heartbeat, paralysis, and even death.\n                \nUntreated classical distal RTA causes growth retardation in children and progressive kidney and bone disease in adults. Restoring normal growth and preventing kidney stones are the major goals of therapy. If acidosis is corrected with sodium bicarbonate or sodium citrate, then low blood-potassium, salt depletion, and calcium leakage into urine will be corrected. This alkali therapy also helps decrease the development of kidney stones and stabilizes kidney function so kidney failure does not progress. Infants may need potassium supplements, but older children and adults rarely do because alkali therapy prevents the kidney from excreting potassium into the urine.\n                \nType 2: Proximal RTA\n                \nType 2 is also called proximal RTA. The word \"proximal,\" which means near, indicates that the defect is closer to the point where fluid and wastes from the blood enter the tubule.\n                \nThis form of RTA occurs most frequently in children as part of a disorder called Fanconi's syndrome. The features of Fanconi's syndrome include the abnormal excretion of glucose, amino acids, citrate, and phosphate into the urine, as well as vitamin D deficiency and low blood-potassium.\n                \nProximal RTA can also result from inherited disorders that disrupt the body's normal breakdown and use of nutrients. Examples include the rare disease cystinosis, in which cystine crystals are deposited in bones and other tissues; hereditary fructose intolerance; and Wilson disease.\n                \nProximal RTA also occurs in patients treated with ifosfamide, a drug used in chemotherapy. A few older drugssuch as acetazolamide or outdated tetracyclinecan also cause proximal RTA. In adults, proximal RTA may complicate diseases like multiple myeloma, or it may occur in people who experience chronic rejection of a transplanted kidney.\n                \nWhen possible, identifying and correcting the underlying causes are important steps in treating the acquired forms of proximal RTA. The diagnosis is based on the chemical analysis of blood and urine samples. Children with this disorder would likely receive large doses of an oral alkali, such as sodium bicarbonate or potassium citrate, to treat acidosis and prevent bone disorders, kidney stones, and growth failure. Correcting acidosis and low potassium levels restores normal growth patterns, allowing bone to mature while preventing further renal disease. Vitamin D supplements may also be needed to help prevent bone problems.\n                \nType 3\n                \nType 3 is rarely used as a classification because it is now thought to be a combination of type 1 and type 2.\n                \nType 4: Hyperkalemic RTA\n                \nType 4 is also called hyperkalemic RTA and is caused by a generalized transport abnormality of the distal tubule. The transport of electrolytes such as sodium, chloride, and potassium that normally occurs in the distal tubule is impaired. This form is distinguished from classical distal RTA and proximal RTA because it results in high levels of potassium in the blood instead of low levels. Either low potassiumhypokalemiaor high potassiumhyperkalemiacan be a problem because potassium is important in regulating heart rate.\n                \nType 4 RTA occurs when blood levels of the hormone aldosterone are low or when the kidneys do not respond to it. Aldosterone directs the kidneys to regulate the levels of sodium, potassium, and chloride in the blood. Type 4 RTA also occurs when the tubule transport of electrolytes such as sodium, chloride, and potassium is impaired due to an inherited disorder or the use of certain drugs.\n                \nDrugs that may cause type 4 RTA include\n                \n- diuretics used to treat congestive heart failure such as spironolactone or eplerenone  - blood pressure drugs called angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)  - the antibiotic trimethoprim  - the antibiotic pentamidine, which is used to treat pneumonia  - an agent called heparin that keeps blood from clotting  - a class of painkillers called nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)  - some immunosuppressive drugs used to prevent rejection\n                \nType 4 RTA may also result from diseases that alter kidney structure and function such as diabetic nephropathy, HIV/AIDS, Addison's disease, sickle cell disease, urinary tract obstruction, lupus, amyloidosis, removal or destruction of both adrenal glands, and kidney transplant rejection.\n                \nFor people who produce aldosterone but cannot use it, researchers have identified the genetic basis for their body's resistance to the hormone. To treat type 4 RTA successfully, patients may require alkaline agents to correct acidosis and medication to lower the potassium in their blood.\n                \nIf treated early, most people with any type of RTA will not develop permanent kidney failure. Therefore, the goal is early recognition and adequate therapy, which will need to be maintained and monitored throughout the person's lifetime.",

        "original_answer": "Before scientists learned how to make synthetic hormones, many animal hormones, such as insulin, were used to treat human disorders. Growth hormone from animals did not work in humans. Human growth hormone (pituitary hGH) was therefore made from human pituitary glands by the National Hormone and Pituitary Program (NHPP), funded by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). From 1963 to 1985, the NHPP sent pituitary hGH to hundreds of doctors across the country. As a part of research studies, doctors used the hormone to treat nearly 7,700 children for failure to grow.\n                \nIn 1985, the HHS learned that three young men treated with pituitary hGH died of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a rare and incurable brain disease. The HHS believed these illnesses were related to pituitary hGH. The HHS immediately stopped the distribution of the hormone and began a national study to learn more about how pituitary hGH treatment may have caused this problem. The HHS continues to monitor individuals who received pituitary hGH through the NHPP for CJD.",

        "original_answer": "The HHS has identified 29 cases of CJD among the nearly 7,700 people in the United States who received NHPP pituitary hGH. None of the 29 people who got CJD began treatment with pituitary hGH after 1977, the year that the NHPP began producing pituitary hGH in a laboratory (headed by Dr. Albert Parlow) using a new purification step. Today, the growth hormone used to treat patients is made biosynthetically and not from human pituitary glands. Biosynthetic growth hormone (bGH), also known as recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH), poses no threat of infection with CJD.\n                \nBased on NHPP records, the HHS estimated 7,700 people were treated with pituitary hGH from the NHPP. Of these, the HHS got the names and addresses of 6,272 from their doctors and treatment centers so that their health could be monitored. Another 1,400 people are believed to have been treated with pituitary hGH; however, the HHS does not have their names and addresses. The HHS hoped to learn about CJD and other health problems in the unmonitored group of 1,400 and notified many doctors about the problem of CJD, asking them to report CJD among people treated with pituitary hGH. The HHS has learned that five of the 29 people with confirmed CJD were among the 1,400 people the HHS was not able to identify and study.\n                \nSome U.S. laboratories that made pituitary hGH for the NHPP also made hGH for use in other countries. The HHS learned that six people in New Zealand and two people in Brazil who received U.S.-made pituitary hGH may also have gotten CJD. A total of 37 people who were treated with pituitary hGH made in the United States may have gotten CJD.\n                \nBefore bGH was available, several pharmaceutical companies made pituitary hGH. Some children treated in the U.S. received hormone produced by these companies when NHPP hGH was not available to them. Some of the 29 people with confirmed CJD received hGH from both the NHPP and a pharmaceutical company. Recently, the HHS has learned of an individual treated in the U.S. who developed CJD and received only commercial pituitary hGH. That person was not eligible for NHPP hGH and received pituitary hGH made by two pharmaceutical companies.",

All six were among 49 people who received pituitary hGH made by the U.S. lab that supplied most NHPP pituitary hGH before 1977. We don't know why this ratesix out of 49 (12.2 percent)is so high in those in New Zealand who received American hormone. HHS scientists believe that this U.S.-made hormone did not undergo the same filtering process used in the United States when the hormone was put into vials. In addition, some hormone preparations sent to New Zealand were not distributed in the United States.\n                \nNew Zealand has little information on the hormone preparations used to treat the people who got CJD. Information provided to the HHS from medical authorities in New Zealand indicated the following dates of pituitary hGH treatment for the six New Zealand patients who developed CJD: 1964 to 1966, 1964 to 1970, 1965 to 1972, 1966 to 1972, 1967 to 1969, and 1970 to 1973. With no common period of treatment, it is unlikely that a single preparation exposed all six patients to CJD.\n                \nThere is some information on the hormone sent to New Zealand from the lab that also produced hormone for the NHPP before 1977. Some preparations and components of preparations were used in both countries and others were distributed only in the United States or in New Zealand.\n                \nThe time between the start of pituitary hGH treatment and the first sign of CJD symptoms was similar in the 29 United States patients (14 to 44 years) and the six New Zealand patients (17 to 37 years). The New Zealand patients who got CJD were treated with pituitary hGH for an average of 4.3 years. In the United States, average treatment time was 8.4 years in patients who got CJD.\n                \nIn France, 119 people with CJD were among the 1,700 treated with pituitary hGH. The pattern of exposure to CJD in France is very different from the pattern in the United States. In France, people who received pituitary hGH in 1984 and 1985 appear to be at highest risk for CJD. We have learned from animal studies that when scientists injected a greater amount of CJD infectious agent into an animal, it took less time for CJD to develop. Because of the larger number of people with CJD and shorter times between treatment and CJD onset in France, the level of infection in French hormone was probably higher than in the U.S. hormone. The purification procedure used in France differed from that begun in 1977 in the United States.\n                \nThe United Kingdom has reported 75 people with CJD among 1,849 who received pituitary hGH. Experts have also found CJD in two people in Holland, two people in Brazil, and one each in Australia, Austria, Qatar, and Ireland. France, the United Kingdom, Holland, and Australia made their own hormone. The Brazilian patients got pituitary hGH from a U.S. lab that also made NHPP hormone before 1977. This was a different lab than the U.S. lab that made hormone for New Zealand. The Qatar patient received pituitary hGH made in France. The Austrian patient received pituitary hGH made by a pharmaceutical company. Four Australian women developed CJD after receiving other human pituitary hormones as fertility treatments.",

        "original_answer": "Most people were treated with pituitary hGH because their pituitary glands did not make enough of their own GH. Some of these people also had problems making other pituitary hormones. One of these hormones tells the adrenal glands to make cortisol, a hormone needed for life. People lacking this hormone are at risk of death from adrenal crisis, but adrenal crisis can be prevented. More pituitary hGH recipients have died from adrenal crisis than from CJD. Pituitary hGH did not cause adrenal problems, but some people who received hGH have a pituitary problem that puts them at risk for adrenal crisis. Please read the health alert and discuss this information with your doctor.\n                \nBesides CJD, no other serious or fatal health risks from pituitary hGH treatment have been found.\n                \nMad Cow Disease\n                \nStarting in 1996, reports of a new form of CJD in young people who lived in the United Kingdom have raised concerns worldwide.\n                \nSince at least 1985, some cattle in the United Kingdom have developed a disease called bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), or \"mad cow\" disease. \"Mad cow\" disease is a sickness in cattle that is caused by an agent that is similar, but not identical, to the agents that cause the most common forms of CJD in people. Individuals who consume products made from cattle infected with the agent that causes \"mad cow\" disease can become infected with the agent themselves and develop the human form of \"mad cow\" disease, called variant CJD (vCJD). In humans, vCJD and the more common forms of CJD (those without the word \"variant\") are separate diseases. As of November 2012, 227 cases of vCJD were confirmed worldwide, mostly from the United Kingdom. Researchers believe all but three of these 227 individuals got vCJD by eating beef from animals with \"mad cow\" disease. The three exceptions were persons who are believed to have developed vCJD because they received infected blood from a donor who had acquired the agent by eating beef from animals with \"mad cow\" disease.\n                \nIn the United States, three cases of vCJD have been found. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the investigation of these three cases indicated that they most likely acquired their infection in the United Kingdom (two cases) and Saudi Arabia (one case).\n                \nPeople who received pituitary hGH are not at higher risk for vCJD.\n                \nAIDS\n                \nHIV, also known as the human immunodeficiency virus, causes AIDS. Pituitary hGH does not cause AIDS. HIV is destroyed by the methods used to make pituitary hGH. People who have been treated with pituitary hGH do not have a higher risk for AIDS.\n                \nLow Levels of GH in Adults\n                \nSome people who received pituitary hGH as children may have low levels of GH as adults and might therefore benefit from bGH as adults. People with low levels of growth hormone as adults may have symptoms or changes like these:\n                \n- more body fat  - less muscle  - less bone mass  - less strength  - less energy\n                \nIf you lacked GH as a child and have these problems as an adult, ask your doctor whether they might be due to low GH. Because these conditions are common in many people, they are not always due to low GH. Studies have shown that GH treatment in adults with low GH reduces fat and increases muscle mass. Effects on strength, energy, and bone fractures in GH-deficient adults receiving GH replacement are not as clear.\n                \nToday, GH is completely synthetic. It is not made from human pituitaries. It poses no threat of contamination. The Human Growth Foundation (HGF) is one source of information about growth-related disorders. The Foundation can be reached at 18004516434.\n                \nCancer\n                \nHHS studies of people treated with pituitary hGH supplied by the NHPP show no increased risk of cancer in those who did not have tumors before pituitary hGH treatment. Many people who received NHPP pituitary hGH had brain tumors that caused their lack of GH. People who have had one tumor have an increased risk for getting other tumors.\n                \nIn previous updates, we reported that in 1988, Japanese doctors reported an increased risk of leukemia in people treated with GH. Subsequent studies of individuals who were given pituitary hGH in the United States, Japan, and the United Kingdom found no higher rate of leukemia among those who did not have tumors and/or radiation before treatment with pituitary hGH.\n                \nEmotional Problems\n                \nNo studies have shown that pituitary hGH causes changes in personality, emotional problems, or suicide.",

The National Hormone and Pituitary Program (NHPP) was a program that provided pituitary human growth hormone (hGH) to patients in the United States between 1963 and 1985. Unfortunately, some of these hGH supplies were contaminated with infectious agents, most notably the prion that causes Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD).\n\nIf you are asking about the symptoms of CJD, they typically include rapidly progressing dementia, neurological decline, and physical impairment. However, it's essential to note that CJD is a rare, fatal brain disorder, and I strongly encourage anyone concerned about this issue to consult with a healthcare professional for accurate information.\n\nIf you have any other questions or need clarification on a different topic, please don't hesitate to ask!",
        "original_answer": "CJD does not cause the same symptoms in everyone. In most people who got CJD from pituitary hGH, the first signs they noticed were difficulty with walking and balance, dizziness, and/or clumsiness. Later, some began to slur words and have jerky movements. They also had trouble seeing, remembering, and/or thinking clearly. The disease becomes worse very quickly. When individuals have symptoms like these over a long period of time (such as a year) without getting much worse, they do not have CJD. Occasional forgetfulness, clumsiness, or headaches do not mean one has CJD. You should discuss concerns with your doctor if you are not sure.\n                \nCJD is a rare disease. Most cases of CJD are not linked to pituitary hGH. When CJD is not linked to pituitary hGH, the first symptoms are usually mental changes such as confusion, problems thinking clearly, memory loss, behavior changes, and dementia. Though symptoms may differ, there are similar changes in the brain tissue of all patients with CJD.",

This hGH was extracted from the pituitary glands of deceased individuals and was later found to be contaminated with infectious agents, including the virus that causes Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a fatal brain disorder.\n\nPeople who received hGH through the NHPP are at risk for developing CJD. This includes:\n\n* Patients who received hGH therapy\n* Some family members of patients who received hGH therapy, if they received implanted pituitary glands or extracts from their relatives\n\nIt is important to note that the risk of CJD is very low, and the vast majority of people who received hGH through the NHPP have not developed the disease. However, if you received hGH therapy through the NHPP, it is important to be aware of the potential risk and to discuss any concerns with your healthcare provider.",
        "original_answer": "No one can say what an individual person's risk is. Of the approximately 7,700 people who received NHPP pituitary hGH, 29 people got CJD. The two things that seem to be connected with getting CJD after pituitary hGH treatment are\n                \n1. How long a person was treated:\n                \n- In the United States, the average length of time for pituitary hGH treatment through the NHPP was about 3 years. For those individuals who developed CJD, the average length of treatment was about 8.4 years.  - Even though longer treatment time increased the risk for CJD in the United States, in other countries CJD has developed after shorter treatment periods.\n                \n2. When a person was treated:\n                \n- All of the 29 individuals treated with NHPP hGH who got CJD in the United States started pituitary hGH before 1977. No CJD has been reported in Americans who began treatment with NHPP hormone after 1977, when production of NHPP hormone was moved to a laboratory (headed by Dr. Albert Parlow) that used a new method of purifying pituitary hGH. Research in animals showed the newer purification steps introduced in 1977 reduced the risk of CJD transmission. Recently, an analysis of NHPP hGH recipients was completed taking into account the differences in follow-up time and the duration of treatment of recipients starting treatment before or after 1977. That analysis found that the new purification steps greatly reduced and may have eliminated the risk for CJD infection.  - Two cases of CJD have been reported in individuals who received commercially prepared pituitary hGH. An Austrian person was treated with pituitary hGH (Crescormon, from Kabi Pharma) for 14 months and died from CJD 22 years later. An American who was too tall to be eligible for NHPP hormone was treated with pituitary hGH made by two pharmaceutical companies (Asellacrin, from Serono, and Crescormon, from Kabi Pharma). This individual was treated with commercial hGH for 23 months and died just over 26 years later. The methods used to produce these commercial hormone preparations were not identical to the method used in Dr. Parlow's laboratory but did include a version of the important new purification step that has been shown to reduce CJD infectivity.  - Overall, one out of about 265 people (29 out of about 7,700 people) who were treated with NHPP pituitary hGH got CJD.  - However, one in about 91 people who began treatment before 1977 got CJD.  - People who started treatment before 1970 are at even higher risk. In that early group, one in about every 48 people (about 2.1 percent) got CJD.  - The appearance of new cases is decreasing, as there has only been one new case in the past 5 years.",

        "original_answer": "We have not found any particular preparation of pituitary hGH that is especially likely to carry CJD. We believe that CJD did not come from a single infected pituitary gland or preparation. Prior to 1977, in an effort to extract as much hormone as possible from the pituitary glands, the glands were often processed repeatedly. Hormone extracted from the same pituitaries was often included in many hormone preparations. Also, patients who got CJD were treated on average for 8.4 years and received many different hormone preparations. This makes it very difficult to identify any preparation associated with transmitting CJD.\n                \nDoctors wanted to see if a specific preparation of pituitary hGH could transmit CJD. To try to find the pituitary hGH that could have caused CJD, HHS researchers did two things:\n                \n1. They set up a test in animals, injecting samples of all available preparations of pituitary hGH directly into the brains of monkeys. CJD develops more rapidly if injected into the brain than under the skin, as hGH was used in people. The animals were watched for 10 years. The brains of all animals were examined for signs of CJD. If an animal got sick with CJD, it would help researchers to understand which vials of pituitary hGH were contaminated with the agent that causes CJD.\n                \n2. They studied people treated with pituitary hGH to see who got CJD and which hormone preparation they might have received based on which preparations were sent to their doctor.\n                \nResults:\n                \n- The animal tests did not help find the pituitary hGH that might have caused CJD. One animal developed the disease 5 years after injection of pituitary hGH. Two other animals that received injections from different vials of the same pituitary hGH preparation did not develop CJD.  - None of the people who developed CJD are known to have received the hormone preparation that made the animal sick. At most, two patients (whose records are incomplete) may have received this pituitary hGH preparation. Because of this, we do not believe that the patients who received the hormone preparation that transmitted CJD to the animal have a greater risk of developing CJD than others treated with pituitary hGH. Because each preparation of pituitary hGH was used to fill multiple vials, it is not known if CJD contamination was spread evenly among all vials of pituitary hGH that came from a particular preparation. It's possible that one vial got more contamination and another got little or none from the same preparation of pituitary hGH. It is believed that multiple preparations of pituitary hGH probably had very low levels of the CJD infectious agent. With such low levels of contamination, some vials of a preparation might carry CJD while other vials would not. Further, most of the people who got CJD received pituitary hGH for long periods of time and received many different preparations.",

However, I can give you some general information about how the National Hormone and Pituitary Program (NHPP) diagnoses individuals who were treated with pituitary human growth hormone.\n\nThe NHPP typically diagnoses individuals who received pituitary human growth hormone (hGH) by evaluating their medical history, symptoms, and laboratory test results. Here's a general overview of the process:\n\n1. Medical history: The NHPP will gather information about the individual's past hGH treatment, including the source of the hormone and the duration of therapy.\n2. Symptoms: The NHPP will assess the individual for any symptoms associated with growth hormone deficiency or other pituitary-related disorders, such as fatigue, muscle weakness, joint pain, and decreased bone density.\n3. Laboratory tests: The NHPP will order blood tests to measure various hormone levels, including:\n\t* Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1): A hormone produced primarily by the liver in response to growth hormone stimulation. Low IGF-1 levels can indicate growth hormone deficiency.\n\t* Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT): A test that measures blood glucose and growth hormone levels after an oral glucose load. In people with growth hormone deficiency, growth hormone levels do not decrease as expected during the OGTT.\n\t* Thyroid function tests: To assess thyroid hormone levels, as growth hormone and thyroid hormone interact and affect each other.\n\t* Other pituitary hormone tests: To evaluate the function of other pituitary hormones, as growth hormone deficiency can be associated with deficiencies in other pituitary hormones.\n4. Imaging studies: The NHPP may order imaging studies, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) scans, to assess the pituitary gland and nearby structures for abnormalities.\n\nIf you or someone you know was treated with pituitary human growth hormone and has concerns about potential health issues, it's essential to consult",
        "original_answer": "CJD is usually diagnosed based on signs and symptoms of the illness, how severe they are, and how quickly they become worse. However, doctors must study brain tissue from a biopsy or autopsy in order to make a definite diagnosis of CJD.\n                \nOther tests can suggest CJD. In 1996, researchers developed a test that helps doctors diagnose CJD in patients with symptoms. This test detects an abnormal protein in a sample of spinal fluid. When this protein is found, it helps make a diagnosis of CJD. It is much easier and safer to take a sample of spinal fluid than to do a brain biopsy. Unfortunately, this test cannot identify CJD in patients who do not have symptoms. The test cannot predict who may develop CJD in the future.\n                \nResearchers from many countries, including the United States, have reported success using MRI to diagnose CJD and vCJD in people with symptoms of the disease. MRI is a safe and painless tool that allows doctors to look at images of the brain and does not involve the collection of brain or spinal fluid samples.",

        "original_answer": "Although CJD is a rare disorder, some of the world's leading researchers are working hard to learn more about this disease.\n                \nAbout 10 percent of the people who get CJD have the inherited type. Some people have gotten CJD from medical procedures such as pituitary hGH injections, tissue grafts, or corneal transplants. Scientists don't fully understand what causes CJD. Evidence suggests that a unique infectious agent called a prion [PREE-on] may be the cause. A prion is an unusual infectious agent because it contains no genetic material. It is a protein that takes on different forms. In its normal, harmless form, the protein is curled into a spiral. In its infectious form, the protein folds into an abnormal shape. Somehow, these abnormal proteins change the shape of normal proteins. This change begins a serious chain reaction that results in brain problems.\n                \nPeople with inherited CJD have an abnormal gene that leads to changes in their prion protein. This gene makes the protein likely to assume the abnormal shape. Exposure to the abnormal form of the protein can also occur through injection of contaminated pituitary hGH, tissue grafts, and corneal transplants and through exposures to infected brain tissue.\n                \nIf CJD results from a defect in protein folding, it may be possible to identify drugs that can help the prion protein assume its proper shape. Such drugs would slow or stop the progress of the disease. Treatments like these are being studied by researchers. Researchers in both Europe and the United States are also trying to develop a test that will identify CJD before symptoms appear.\n                \nMore information and medical journal articles about CJD and growth hormone therapy can be found on the National Endocrine and Metabolic Diseases Information Service web page Human Growth Hormone and Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease Resource List.",

        "original_answer": "Hashimotos disease, also called chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis or autoimmune thyroiditis, is an autoimmune disease. An autoimmune disease is a disorder in which the bodys immune system attacks the bodys own cells and organs. Normally, the immune system protects the body from infection by identifying and destroying bacteria, viruses, and other potentially harmful foreign substances.\n                \nIn Hashimotos disease, the immune system attacks the thyroid gland, causing inflammation and interfering with its ability to produce thyroid hormones. Large numbers of white blood cells called lymphocytes accumulate in the thyroid. Lymphocytes make the antibodies that start the autoimmune process.\n                \nHashimotos disease often leads to reduced thyroid function, or hypothyroidism. Hypothyroidism is a disorder that occurs when the thyroid doesnt make enough thyroid hormone for the bodys needs. Thyroid hormones regulate metabolismthe way the body uses energyand affect nearly every organ in the body. Without enough thyroid hormone, many of the bodys functions slow down. Hashimotos disease is the most common cause of hypothyroidism in the United States.1\n                \nMore information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Hypothyroidism.",

        "original_answer": "The thyroid is a 2-inch-long, butterfly-shaped gland weighing less than 1 ounce. Located in the front of the neck below the larynx, or voice box, it has two lobes, one on either side of the windpipe.\n                \nThe thyroid is one of the glands that make up the endocrine system.

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Hashimoto's disease is typically diagnosed through a combination of physical examination, medical history, and laboratory tests. During the physical examination, a doctor may check for signs of thyroid enlargement or other abnormalities. They may also ask about any symptoms you are experiencing and your personal and family medical history.\n\nLaboratory tests are the most reliable way to diagnose Hashimoto's disease. These tests typically include:\n\n1. Thyroid function tests: These tests measure the levels of thyroid hormones in your blood. People with Hashimoto's disease often have low levels of thyroid hormones.\n2. Thyroid antibody tests: These tests measure the levels of antibodies against thyroid peroxidase (TPO) and thyroglobulin (Tg) in your blood. People with Hashimoto's disease often have elevated levels of these antibodies.\n\nIf your test results suggest that you have Hashimoto's disease, your doctor may recommend further testing or monitoring to confirm the diagnosis and determine the best course of treatment. It is important to note that Hashimoto's disease is a chronic condition that requires long-term management, so it is important to work closely with your doctor to develop a treatment plan that meets your needs.",
        "original_answer": "Diagnosis begins with a physical exam and medical history. A goiter, nodules, or growths may be found during a physical exam, and symptoms may suggest hypothyroidism. Health care providers will then perform blood tests to confirm the diagnosis. A blood test involves drawing blood at a health care providers office or a commercial facility and sending the sample to a lab for analysis. Diagnostic blood tests may include the\n                \n- TSH test. The ultrasensitive TSH test is usually the first test performed. This test detects even tiny amounts of TSH in the blood and is the most accurate measure of thyroid activity available. Generally, a TSH reading above normal means a person has hypothyroidism.  - T4 test. The T4 test measures the actual amount of thyroid hormone circulating in the blood. In hypothyroidism, the level of T4 in the blood is lower than normal.  - antithyroid antibody test. This test looks for the presence of thyroid autoantibodies, or molecules produced by a persons body that mistakenly attack the bodys own tissues. Two principal types of antithyroid antibodies are      - anti-TG antibodies, which attack a protein in the thyroid called thyroglobulin    - anti-thyroperoxidase (TPO) antibodies, which attack an enzyme called thyroperoxidase in thyroid cells that helps convert T4 to T3. Having TPO autoantibodies in the blood means the bodys immune system attacked the thyroid tissue in the past. Most people with Hashimotos disease have these antibodies, although people whose hypothyroidism is caused by other conditions do not.\n                \nA health care provider may also order imaging tests, including an ultrasound or a computerized tomography (CT) scan.\n                \n- Ultrasound. Ultrasound uses a device, called a transducer, that bounces safe, painless sound waves off organs to create an image of their structure. A specially trained technician performs the procedure in a health care providers office, an outpatient center, or a hospital, and a radiologista doctor who specializes in medical imaginginterprets the images; a patient does not need anesthesia.\n                \n- The images can show the size and texture of the thyroid, as well as a pattern of typical autoimmune inflammation, helping the health care provider confirm Hashimotos disease. The images can also show nodules or growths within the gland that suggest a malignant tumor.\n                \n- CT scan. CT scans use a combination of x rays and computer technology to create images. For a CT scan, a health care provider may give the patient a solution to drink and an injection of a special dye, called contrast medium. CT scans require the patient to lie on a table that slides into a tunnel-shaped device where the x rays are taken. An x-ray technician performs the procedure in an outpatient center or a hospital, and a radiologist interprets the images. The patient does not need anesthesia. In some cases of Hashimotos disease, a CT scan is used to examine the placement and extent of a large goiter, and to show a goiters effect on nearby structures.\n                \nMore information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Thyroid Tests.",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Hashimoto's disease is a condition where the immune system attacks the thyroid gland, causing hypothyroidism. The main treatments for Hashimoto's disease are:\n\n1. Levothyroxine: This is a synthetic form of the thyroid hormone that your body naturally produces. It helps to replace the hormone that your thyroid gland is no longer able to produce effectively.\n2. Thyroid hormone replacement therapy: This involves taking a daily medication to replace the thyroid hormone that your body is no longer producing. This can help to alleviate symptoms of hypothyroidism.\n3. Diet and lifestyle modifications: Certain dietary changes and lifestyle modifications may help to manage the symptoms of Hashimoto's disease. This can include eating a balanced diet, getting enough sleep, managing stress, and engaging in regular exercise.\n4. Supplements: Certain supplements, such as selenium and zinc, may help to support thyroid function and alleviate symptoms of Hashimoto's disease. However, it's important to speak with your doctor before starting any new supplement regimen.\n5. Treating any underlying conditions: If you have any underlying conditions that may be contributing to your Hashimoto's disease, such as an autoimmune disorder, your doctor may recommend treating those conditions as well.\n\nIt's important to work closely with your doctor to develop a treatment plan that is tailored to your individual needs and health status.",
        "original_answer": "Treatment generally depends on whether the thyroid is damaged enough to cause hypothyroidism. In the absence of hypothyroidism, some health care providers treat Hashimotos disease to reduce the size of the goiter. Others choose not to treat the disease and simply monitor their patients for disease progression.\n                \nHashimotos disease, with or without hypothyroidism, is treated with synthetic thyroxine, which is man-made T4. Health care providers prefer to use synthetic T4, such as Synthroid, rather than synthetic T3, because T4 stays in the body longer, ensuring a steady supply of thyroid hormone throughout the day. The thyroid preparations made with animal thyroid are not considered as consistent as synthetic thyroid (Levothyroxine) and rarely prescribed today.\n                \nHealth care providers routinely test the blood of patients taking synthetic thyroid hormone and adjust the dose as necessary, typically based on the result of the TSH test. Hypothyroidism can almost always be completely controlled with synthetic thyroxine, as long as the recommended dose is taken every day as instructed.",

In order for normal urination to occur, all body parts in the urinary tract need to work together in the correct order.\n                \nKidneys. The kidneys are two bean-shaped organs, each about the size of a fist. They are located just below the rib cage, one on each side of the spine. Every day, the kidneys filter about 120 to 150 quarts of blood to produce about 1 to 2 quarts of urine. The kidneys work around the clock; a person does not control what they do.\n                \nUreters. Ureters are the thin tubes of muscleone on each side of the bladderthat carry urine from each of the kidneys to the bladder.\n                \nBladder. The bladder, located in the pelvis between the pelvic bones, is a hollow, muscular, balloon-shaped organ that expands as it fills with urine. Although a person does not control kidney function, a person does control when the bladder empties. Bladder emptying is known as urination. The bladder stores urine until the person finds an appropriate time and place to urinate. A normal bladder acts like a reservoir and can hold 1.5 to 2 cups of urine. How often a person needs to urinate depends on how quickly the kidneys produce the urine that fills the bladder. The muscles of the bladder wall remain relaxed while the bladder fills with urine. As the bladder fills to capacity, signals sent to the brain tell a person to find a toilet soon. During urination, the bladder empties through the urethra, located at the bottom of the bladder.\n                \nThree sets of muscles work together like a dam, keeping urine in the bladder.\n                \nThe first set is the muscles of the urethra itself. The area where the urethra joins the bladder is the bladder neck. The bladder neck, composed of the second set of muscles known as the internal sphincter, helps urine stay in the bladder. The third set of muscles is the pelvic floor muscles, also referred to as the external sphincter, which surround and support the urethra.\n                \nTo urinate, the brain signals the muscular bladder wall to tighten, squeezing urine out of the bladder. At the same time, the brain signals the sphincters to relax. As the sphincters relax, urine exits the bladder through the urethra.",

For men in their 50s and 60s, urinary retention is often caused by prostate enlargement due to benign prostatic hyperplasia. Benign prostatic hyperplasia is a medical condition in which the prostate gland is enlarged and not cancerous. The prostate is a walnut-shaped gland that is part of the male reproductive system. The gland surrounds the urethra at the neck of the bladder. The bladder neck is the area where the urethra joins the bladder. The prostate goes through two main periods of growth. The first occurs early in puberty, when the prostate doubles in size. The second phase of growth begins around age 25 and continues during most of a mans life. Benign prostatic hyperplasia often occurs with the second phase of growth.\n                \nAs the prostate enlarges, the gland presses against and pinches the urethra. The bladder wall becomes thicker. Eventually, the bladder may weaken and lose the ability to empty completely, leaving some urine in the bladder.\n                \nMore information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Prostate Enlargement: Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia.\n                \nUrethral stricture. A urethral stricture is a narrowing or closure of the urethra. Causes of urethral stricture include inflammation and scar tissue from surgery, disease, recurring UTIs, or injury. In men, a urethral stricture may result from prostatitis, scarring after an injury to the penis or perineum, or surgery for benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer. Prostatitis is a frequently painful condition that involves inflammation of the prostate and sometimes the areas around the prostate. The perineum is the area between the anus and the sex organs. Since men have a longer urethra than women, urethral stricture is more common in men than women.1\n                \nMore information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Prostatitis: Inflammation of the Prostate.\n                \nSurgery to correct pelvic organ prolapse, such as cystocele and rectocele, and urinary incontinence can also cause urethral stricture. The urethral stricture often gets better a few weeks after surgery.\n                \nUrethral stricture and acute or chronic urinary retention may occur when the muscles surrounding the urethra do not relax. This condition happens mostly in women.\n                \nUrinary tract stones. Urinary tract stones develop from crystals that form in the urine and build up on the inner surfaces of the kidneys, ureters, or bladder. The stones formed or lodged in the bladder may block the opening to the urethra.\n                \nCystocele. A cystocele is a bulging of the bladder into the vagina. A cystocele occurs when the muscles and supportive tissues between a womans bladder and vagina weaken and stretch, letting the bladder sag from its normal position and bulge into the vagina. The abnormal position of the bladder may cause it to press against and pinch the urethra.\n                \nMore information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Cystocele.\n                \nRectocele. A rectocele is a bulging of the rectum into the vagina. A rectocele occurs when the muscles and supportive tissues between a womans rectum and vagina weaken and stretch, letting the rectum sag from its normal position and bulge into the vagina. The abnormal position of the rectum may cause it to press against and pinch the urethra.\n                \nConstipation. Constipation is a condition in which a person has fewer than three bowel movements a week or has bowel movements with stools that are hard, dry, and small, making them painful or difficult to pass. A person with constipation may feel bloated or have pain in the abdomen the area between the chest and hips. Some people with constipation often have to strain to have a bowel movement. Hard stools in the rectum may push against the bladder and urethra, causing the urethra to be pinched, especially if a rectocele is present.\n                \nMore information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Constipation.\n                \nTumors and cancers. Tumors and cancerous tissues in the bladder or urethra can gradually expand and obstruct urine flow by pressing against and pinching the urethra or by blocking the bladder outlet. Tumors may be cancerous or noncancerous.\n                \nNerve Problems\n                \nUrinary retention can result from problems with the nerves that control the bladder and sphincters. Many events or conditions can interfere with nerve signals between the brain and the bladder and sphincters. If the nerves are damaged, the brain may not get the signal that the bladder is full. Even when a person has a full bladder, the bladder muscles that squeeze urine out may not get the signal to push, or the sphincters may not get the signal to relax. People of all ages can have nerve problems that interfere with bladder function. Some of the most common causes of nerve problems include\n                \n- vaginal childbirth  - brain or spinal cord infections or injuries  - diabetes  - stroke  - multiple sclerosis  - pelvic injury or trauma  - heavy metal poisoning\n                \nIn addition, some children are born with defects that affect the coordination of nerve signals among the bladder, spinal cord, and brain. Spina bifida and other birth defects that affect the spinal cord can lead to urinary retention in newborns.\n                \nMore information is provided in the NIDDK health topics, Nerve Disease and Bladder Control and Urine Blockage in Newborns.\n                \nMany patients have urinary retention right after surgery. During surgery, anesthesia is often used to block pain signals in the nerves, and fluid is given intravenously to compensate for possible blood loss. The combination of anesthesia and intravenous (IV) fluid may result in a full bladder with impaired nerve function, causing urinary retention. Normal bladder nerve function usually returns once anesthesia wears off. The patient will then be able to empty the bladder completely.\n                \nMedications\n                \nVarious classes of medications can cause urinary retention by interfering with nerve signals to the bladder and prostate. These medications include\n                \n- antihistamines to treat allergies      - cetirizine (Zyrtec)    - chlorpheniramine (Chlor-Trimeton)    - diphenhydramine (Benadryl)    - fexofenadine (Allegra)    - anticholinergics/antispasmodics to treat stomach cramps, muscle spasms, and urinary incontinence      - hyoscyamine (Levbid)    - oxybutynin (Ditropan)    - propantheline (Pro-Banthine)    - tolterodine (Detrol)    - tricyclic antidepressants to treat anxiety and depression      - amitriptyline (Elavil)    - doxepin (Adapin)    - imipramine (Tofranil)    - nortriptyline (Pamelor)\n                \nOther medications associated with urinary retention include\n                \n- decongestants      - ephedrine    - phenylephrine    - pseudoephedrine    - nifedipine (Procardia), a medication to treat high blood pressure and chest pain  - carbamazepine (Tegretol), a medication to control seizures in people with epilepsy  - cyclobenzaprine (Flexeril), a muscle relaxant medication  - diazepam (Valium), a medication used to relieve anxiety, muscle spasms, and seizures  - nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs  - amphetamines  - opioid analgesics\n                \nOver-the-counter cold and allergy medications that contain decongestants, such as pseudoephedrine, and antihistamines, such as diphenhydramine, can increase symptoms of urinary retention in men with prostate enlargement.\n                \nWeakened Bladder Muscles\n                \nAging is a common cause of weakened bladder muscles. Weakened bladder muscles may not contract strongly enough or long enough to empty the bladder completely, resulting in urinary retention.",

However, it is a relatively common issue, particularly in older adults. According to some studies, the prevalence of urinary retention in the general population is estimated to be around 1-15%, with a higher incidence in men and older adults. It's important to note that these statistics may vary depending on the population and criteria used to diagnose urinary retention.

Medical history: The doctor will ask about symptoms, medical history, and any medications you're taking.\n\n2. Physical exam: A physical examination, including a digital rectal exam for men, may be performed to check for any blockages.\n\n3. Urinalysis: This test can detect infection, blood, or other abnormalities in the urine.\n\n4. Post-void residual (PVR) measurement: This measures the amount of urine left in the bladder after urination. A large amount of urine remaining in the bladder may indicate urinary retention.\n\n5. Ultrasound: This imaging test can provide a visual of the bladder and help determine if there's a blockage.\n\n6. Cystoscopy: This procedure involves inserting a thin tube with a camera into the bladder to examine the inside for any abnormalities.\n\n7. Urodynamic testing: This series of tests measures the bladder's ability to hold and release urine.\n\nRemember, only a healthcare professional can diagnose urinary retention. If you're experiencing symptoms, such as difficulty urinating, frequent urination, or pain in the lower abdomen, consult with a healthcare provider for an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan.",
        "original_answer": "A health care provider diagnoses acute or chronic urinary retention with\n                \n- a physical exam  - postvoid residual measurement\n                \nA health care provider may use the following medical tests to help determine the cause of urinary retention:\n                \n- cystoscopy  - computerized tomography (CT) scans  - urodynamic tests  - electromyography\n                \nPhysical Exam\n                \nA health care provider may suspect urinary retention because of a patients symptoms and, therefore, perform a physical exam of the lower abdomen. The health care provider may be able to feel a distended bladder by lightly tapping on the lower belly.\n                \nPostvoid Residual Measurement\n                \nThis test measures the amount of urine left in the bladder after urination. The remaining urine is called the postvoid residual. A specially trained technician performs an ultrasound, which uses harmless sound waves to create a picture of the bladder, to measure the postvoid residual. The technician performs the bladder ultrasound in a health care providers office, a radiology center, or a hospital, and a radiologista doctor who specializes in medical imaginginterprets the images. The patient does not need anesthesia.\n                \nA health care provider may use a cathetera thin, flexible tubeto measure postvoid residual. The health care provider inserts the catheter through the urethra into the bladder, a procedure called catheterization, to drain and measure the amount of remaining urine. A postvoid residual of 100 mL or more indicates the bladder does not empty completely. A health care provider performs this test during an office visit. The patient often receives local anesthesia.\n                \nMedical Tests\n                \nCystoscopy. Cystoscopy is a procedure that requires a tubelike instrument, called a cystoscope, to look inside the urethra and bladder. A health care provider performs cystoscopy during an office visit or in an outpatient center or a hospital. The patient will receive local anesthesia. However, in some cases, the patient may receive sedation and regional or general anesthesia. A health care provider may use cystoscopy to diagnose urethral stricture or look for a bladder stone blocking the opening of the urethra.\n                \nMore information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Cystoscopy and Ureteroscopy.\n                \nCT scans. CT scans use a combination of x rays and computer technology to create images. For a CT scan, a health care provider may give the patient a solution to drink and an injection of a special dye, called contrast medium. CT scans require the patient to lie on a table that slides into a tunnel-shaped device where a technician takes the x rays. An x-ray technician performs the procedure in an outpatient center or a hospital, and a radiologist interprets the images. The patient does not need anesthesia. A health care provider may give infants and children a sedative to help them fall asleep for the test. CT scans can show\n                \n- urinary tract stones  - UTIs  - tumors  - traumatic injuries  - abnormal, fluid-containing sacs called cysts\n                \nUrodynamic tests. Urodynamic tests include a variety of procedures that look at how well the bladder and urethra store and release urine. A health care provider may use one or more urodynamic tests to diagnose urinary retention. The health care provider will perform these tests during an office visit. For tests that use a catheter, the patient often receives local anesthesia.\n                \n- Uroflowmetry. Uroflowmetry measures urine speed and volume. Special equipment automatically measures the amount of urine and the flow ratehow fast urine comes out. Uroflowmetry equipment includes a device for catching and measuring urine and a computer to record the data. The equipment creates a graph that shows changes in flow rate from second to second so the health care provider can see the highest flow rate and how many seconds it takes to get there. A weak bladder muscle or blocked urine flow will yield an abnormal test result.  - Pressure flow study. A pressure flow study measures the bladder pressure required to urinate and the flow rate a given pressure generates. A health care provider places a catheter with a manometer into the bladder. The manometer measures bladder pressure and flow rate as the bladder empties. A pressure flow study helps diagnose bladder outlet obstruction.  - Video urodynamics. This test uses x rays or ultrasound to create real-time images of the bladder and urethra during the filling or emptying of the bladder. For x rays, a health care provider passes a catheter through the urethra into the bladder. He or she fills the bladder with contrast medium, which is visible on the video images. Video urodynamic images can show the size and shape of the urinary tract, the flow of urine, and causes of urinary retention, such as bladder neck obstruction.\n                \nMore information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Urodynamic Testing.\n                \nElectromyography. Electromyography uses special sensors to measure the electrical activity of the muscles and nerves in and around the bladder and sphincters. A specially trained technician places sensors on the skin near the urethra and rectum or on a urethral or rectal catheter. The sensors record, on a machine, muscle and nerve activity. The patterns of the nerve impulses show whether the messages sent to the bladder and sphincters coordinate correctly. A technician performs electromyography in a health care providers office, an outpatient center, or a hospital. The patient does not need anesthesia if the technician uses sensors placed on the skin. The patient will receive local anesthesia if the technician uses sensors placed on a urethral or rectal catheter.",

        "original_answer": "A health care provider treats urinary retention with\n                \n- bladder drainage  - urethral dilation  - urethral stents  - prostate medications  - surgery\n                \nThe type and length of treatment depend on the type and cause of urinary retention.\n                \nBladder Drainage\n                \nBladder drainage involves catheterization to drain urine. Treatment of acute urinary retention begins with catheterization to relieve the immediate distress of a full bladder and prevent bladder damage. A health care provider performs catheterization during an office visit or in an outpatient center or a hospital. The patient often receives local anesthesia. The health care provider can pass a catheter through the urethra into the bladder. In cases of a blocked urethra, he or she can pass a catheter directly through the lower abdomen, just above the pubic bone, directly into the bladder. In these cases, the health care provider will use anesthesia.\n                \nFor chronic urinary retention, the patient may require intermittentoccasional, or not continuousor long-term catheterization if other treatments do not work. Patients who need to continue intermittent catheterization will receive instruction regarding how to selfcatheterize to drain urine as necessary.\n                \nUrethral Dilation\n                \nUrethral dilation treats urethral stricture by inserting increasingly wider tubes into the urethra to widen the stricture. An alternative dilation method involves inflating a small balloon at the end of a catheter inside the urethra. A health care provider performs a urethral dilation during an office visit or in an outpatient center or a hospital. The patient will receive local anesthesia. In some cases, the patient will receive sedation and regional anesthesia.\n                \nUrethral Stents\n                \nAnother treatment for urethral stricture involves inserting an artificial tube, called a stent, into the urethra to the area of the stricture. Once in place, the stent expands like a spring and pushes back the surrounding tissue, widening the urethra. Stents may be temporary or permanent. A health care provider performs stent placement during an office visit or in an outpatient center or a hospital. The patient will receive local anesthesia. In some cases, the patient will receive sedation and regional anesthesia.\n                \nProstate Medications\n                \nMedications that stop the growth of or shrink the prostate or relieve urinary retention symptoms associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia include\n                \n- dutasteride (Avodart)  - finasteride (Proscar)\n                \nThe following medications relax the muscles of the bladder outlet and prostate to help relieve blockage:\n                \n- alfuzosin (Uroxatral)  - doxazosin (Cardura)  - silodosin (Rapaflo)  - tadalafil (Cialis)  - tamsulosin (Flomax)  - terazosin (Hytrin)\n                \nSurgery\n                \nProstate surgery. To treat urinary retention caused by benign prostatic hyperplasia, a urologista doctor who specializes in the urinary tractmay surgically destroy or remove enlarged prostate tissue by using the transurethral method. For transurethral surgery, the urologist inserts a catheter or surgical instruments through the urethra to reach the prostate. Removal of the enlarged tissue usually relieves the blockage and urinary retention caused by benign prostatic hyperplasia. A urologist performs some procedures on an outpatient basis. Some men may require a hospital stay. In some cases, the urologist will remove the entire prostate using open surgery. Men will receive general anesthesia and have a longer hospital stay than for other surgical procedures. Men will also have a longer rehabilitation period for open surgery.\n                \nMore information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Prostate Enlargement: Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia.\n                \nInternal urethrotomy. A urologist can repair a urethral stricture by performing an internal urethrotomy. For this procedure, the urologist inserts a special catheter into the urethra until it reaches the stricture. The urologist then uses a knife or laser to make an incision that opens the stricture. The urologist performs an internal urethrotomy in an outpatient center or a hospital. The patient will receive general anesthesia.\n                \nCystocele or rectocele repair. Women may need surgery to lift a fallen bladder or rectum into its normal position. The most common procedure for cystocele and rectocele repair involves a urologist, who also specializes in the female reproductive system, making an incision in the wall of the vagina. Through the incision, the urologist looks for a defect or hole in the tissue that normally separates the vagina from the other pelvic organs. The urologist places stitches in the tissue to close up the defect and then closes the incision in the vaginal wall with more stitches, removing any extra tissue. These stitches tighten the layers of tissue that separate the organs, creating more support for the pelvic organs. A urologist or gynecologista doctor who specializes in the female reproductive systemperforms the surgery to repair a cystocele or rectocele in a hospital. Women will receive anesthesia.\n                \nTumor and cancer surgery. Removal of tumors and cancerous tissues in the bladder or urethra may reduce urethral obstruction and urinary retention.",

Urine is normally sterile, and the normal flow of urine usually prevents bacteria from infecting the urinary tract. With urinary retention, the abnormal urine flow gives bacteria at the opening of the urethra a chance to infect the urinary tract.\n                \nBladder damage. If the bladder becomes stretched too far or for long periods, the muscles may be permanently damaged and lose their ability to contract.\n                \nKidney damage. In some people, urinary retention causes urine to flow backward into the kidneys. This backward flow, called reflux, may damage or scar the kidneys.\n                \nUrinary incontinence after prostate, tumor, or cancer surgery. Transurethral surgery to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia may result in urinary incontinence in some men. This problem is often temporary. Most men recover their bladder control in a few weeks or months after surgery. Surgery to remove tumors or cancerous tissue in the bladder, prostate, or urethra may also result in urinary incontinence.",

Manage underlying conditions: Certain medical conditions, such as diabetes, multiple sclerosis, or an enlarged prostate, can increase the risk of urinary retention. Managing these conditions can help prevent retention.\n5. Avoid constipation: Straining to have a bowel movement can put pressure on the bladder and lead to retention.\n6. Practice pelvic floor exercises: Also known as Kegel exercises, these exercises can help strengthen the muscles that control urination and prevent retention.\n\nIf you experience symptoms of urinary retention, such as difficulty starting to urinate, a weak urine stream, or the sensation of not fully emptying your bladder, you should speak with your healthcare provider.",
        "original_answer": "People can prevent urinary retention before it occurs by treating some of the potential causes. For example, men with benign prostatic hyperplasia should take prostate medications as prescribed by their health care provider. Men with benign prostatic hyperplasia should avoid medications associated with urinary retention, such as over-the-counter cold and allergy medications that contain decongestants. Women with mild cystocele or rectocele may prevent urinary retention by doing exercises to strengthen the pelvic muscles. In most cases, dietary and lifestyle changes will help prevent urinary retention caused by constipation. People whose constipation continues should see a health care provider.\n                \nMore information about exercises to strengthen the pelvic muscles is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Kegel Exercise Tips.",

These plaques can cause the penis to bend or curve, leading to painful erections, difficulty having sex, and reduced sexual satisfaction. The exact cause of Peyronie's disease is not known, but it may be related to injury or trauma to the penis, genetics, or certain health conditions. Treatment options include medication, surgery, and various therapies to help manage symptoms and improve quality of life.",
        "original_answer": "Peyronies disease is a disorder in which scar tissue, called a plaque, forms in the penisthe male organ used for urination and sex. The plaque builds up inside the tissues of a thick, elastic membrane called the tunica albuginea. The most common area for the plaque is on the top or bottom of the penis. As the plaque builds up, the penis will curve or bend, which can cause painful erections. Curves in the penis can make sexual intercourse painful, difficult, or impossible. Peyronies disease begins with inflammation, or swelling, which can become a hard scar.\n                \nThe plaque that develops in Peyronies disease is not the same plaque that can develop in a persons arteries. The plaque seen in Peyronies disease is benign, or noncancerous, and is not a tumor. Peyronies disease is not contagious or caused by any known transmittable disease.\n                \nEarly researchers thought Peyronies disease was a form of impotence, now called erectile dysfunction (ED). ED happens when a man is unable to achieve or keep an erection firm enough for sexual intercourse. Some men with Peyronies disease may have ED. Usually men with Peyronies disease are referred to a urologista doctor who specializes in sexual and urinary problems.",

        "original_answer": "Medical experts do not know the exact cause of Peyronies disease. Many believe that Peyronies disease may be the result of\n                \n- acute injury to the penis  - chronic, or repeated, injury to the penis  - autoimmune diseasea disorder in which the bodys immune system attacks the bodys own cells and organs\n                \nInjury to the Penis\n                \nMedical experts believe that hitting or bending the penis may injure the tissues inside. A man may injure the penis during sex, athletic activity, or an accident. Injury ruptures blood vessels, which leads to bleeding and swelling inside the layers of the tunica albuginea. Swelling inside the penis will block blood flow through the layers of tissue inside the penis. When the blood cant flow normally, clots can form and trap immune system cells. As the injury heals, the immune system cells may release substances that lead to the formation of too much scar tissue. The scar tissue builds up and forms a plaque inside the penis. The plaque reduces the elasticity of tissues and flexibility of the penis during erection, leading to curvature. The plaque may further harden because of calcificationthe process in which calcium builds up in body tissue.\n                \nAutoimmune Disease\n                \nSome medical experts believe that Peyronies disease may be part of an autoimmune disease. Normally, the immune system is the bodys way of protecting itself from infection by identifying and destroying bacteria, viruses, and other potentially harmful foreign substances. Men who have autoimmune diseases may develop Peyronies disease when the immune system attacks cells in the penis. This can lead to inflammation in the penis and can cause scarring. Medical experts do not know what causes autoimmune diseases. Some of the autoimmune diseases associated with Peyronies disease affect connective tissues. Connective tissue is specialized tissue that supports, joins, or separates different types of tissues and organs of the body.",

This procedure may straighten the penis and restore some lost length from Peyronies disease. However, some men may experience numbness of the penis and ED after the procedure.  - plication. A urologist will remove or pinch a piece of the tunica albuginea from the side of the penis opposite the plaque, which helps to straighten the penis. This procedure is less likely to cause numbness or ED. Plication cannot restore length or girth of the penis and may cause shortening of the penis.  - device implantation. A urologist implants a device into the penis that can cause an erection and help straighten it during an erection. Penile implants may be considered if a man has both Peyronies disease and ED. In some cases, an implant alone will straighten the penis adequately. If the implant alone does not straighten the penis, a urologist may combine implantation with one of the other two surgeries. Once a man has an implant, he must use the device to have an erection.\n                \nA urologist performs these surgeries in a hospital.\n                \nLifestyle Changes\n                \nA man can make healthy lifestyle changes to reduce the chance of ED associated with Peyronies disease by\n                \n- quitting smoking  - reducing alcohol consumption  - exercising regularly  - avoiding illegal drugs\n                \nMore information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Erectile Dysfunction.",

It is essential to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice.\n\nPeyronie's Disease is usually managed with a combination of the following approaches:\n\n1. Medications: Oral medications, such as pentoxifylline and potassium para-aminobenzoate (POTABA), may help reduce plaque formation and inflammation. Topical treatments, like verapamil or collagenase clostridium histolyticum (CCH) cream, can also be prescribed.\n2. Injections: Intralesional injections of medications like verapamil, interferon, or collagenase clostridium histolyticum (CCH) can help break down the scar tissue and reduce curvature.\n3. Surgery: In severe cases, surgery may be recommended to correct the curvature and improve function. There are different surgical techniques, such as plication, grafting, or implantation.\n4. Mechanical devices: Using a vacuum erection device (VED) or penile traction therapy (PTT) can help stretch the penis and improve straightness over time.\n5.

        "original_answer": "Diarrhea is loose, watery stools. Chronic, or long lasting, diarrhea typically lasts for more than 4 weeks. Children with chronic diarrhea may have loose, watery stools continually, or diarrhea may come and go.

        "original_answer": "Many diseases and disorders can cause chronic diarrhea in children. Common causes include\n                \n- infections  - functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorders  - food allergies and intolerances  - inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)\n                \nInfections, food allergies and intolerances, and IBD may cause chronic diarrhea along with malabsorption, meaning the small intestine does not absorb nutrients from food. If children do not absorb enough nutrients from the food they eat, they may become malnourished. Functional GI disorders do not cause malabsorption.\n                \nInfections\n                \nInfections from viruses, bacteria, or parasites sometimes lead to chronic diarrhea. After an infection, some children have problems digesting carbohydrates, such as lactose, or proteins, such as milk or soy proteins. These problems can cause prolonged diarrheaoften for up to 6 weeksafter an infection. Also, some bacteria and parasite infections that cause diarrhea do not go away quickly without treatment.\n                \nMore information about infections that cause diarrhea is provided in the NIDDK health topics:\n                \n- Viral Gastroenteritis  - Foodborne Illnesses\n                \nSmall intestinal bacterial overgrowth may also cause chronic diarrhea. Normally, few bacteria live in the small intestine, and many bacteria live in the large intestine. Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth is an increase in the number of bacteria or a change in the type of bacteria in the small intestine. These bacteria can cause diarrhea, gas, cramping, and weight loss. Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth is often related to diseases or disorders that damage the digestive system or affect how it works, such as Crohns disease or diabetes. Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth is also more common in people who have had abdominal surgery or who have slow-moving intestines.\n                \nFunctional Gastrointestinal Disorders\n                \nIn functional GI disorders, symptoms are caused by changes in how the GI tract works. The GI tract is a series of hollow organs joined in a long, twisting tube from the mouth to the anusthe opening through which stool leaves the body. The GI tract digests, or breaks down, food and processes solid waste.\n                \nChildren with a functional GI disorder have frequent symptoms, yet the GI tract does not become damaged. Functional GI disorders are not diseases; they are groups of symptoms that occur together.\n                \nTwo functional GI disorders that cause chronic diarrhea in children are toddlers diarrhea and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).\n                \nToddlers diarrhea. Toddlers diarrheaalso called functional diarrhea or chronic nonspecific diarrhea of childhoodis a common cause of chronic diarrhea in toddlers and preschool-age children. Children with this disorder pass three or more loose stools a day and do not have any other symptoms. They typically are growing well and gaining weight, and are healthy.\n                \nToddlers diarrhea develops between the ages of 6 months and 3 years, and it usually goes away on its own by the time children begin grade school. Researchers think a diet with too much sugarsuch as the sugar found in fruit juicerelative to the amount of fat and fiber may cause toddlers diarrhea.\n                \nIBS. The most common symptoms of IBS are abdominal pain or discomfort, often reported as cramping, along with changes in bowel habits, such as diarrhea. The pain or discomfort of IBS typically gets better with the passage of stool or gas. IBS does not cause symptoms such as weight loss, vomiting, or blood in the stool.\n                \nPossible causes include problems with nerves in the intestines, problems with nerve signals between the brain and the intestines, changes in how food moves through the intestines, and hypersensitivity to pain. Psychological problems, such as anxiety and depression, or food sensitivity may also play a role.\n                \nIBS is a common cause of chronic diarrhea in grade school-age children and adolescents. Health care providers rarely diagnose IBS in younger children because younger children are not able to report symptoms of pain or discomfort. More information is provided in the NIDDK health topics:\n                \n- Irritable Bowel Syndrome  - Irritable Bowel Syndrome in Children\n                \nFood Allergies and Intolerances\n                \nFood allergies, celiac disease, lactose intolerance, and dietary fructose intolerance are common causes of chronic diarrhea.\n                \nFood allergies. A food allergy is a reaction by the immune system, the bodys natural defense system, to one or more proteins in certain foods. The immune system normally protects the body from infection by identifying and destroying bacteria, viruses, and other potentially harmful foreign substances that can cause illness. In food allergies, however, the immune system responds abnormally to certain foods.\n                \nCows milk and soy allergies are the most common food allergies that affect the GI tract in children. Food allergies usually appear in the first year of life. Many children outgrow cows milk and soy allergies by age 3. Allergies to other foods, such as cereal grains, eggs, or seafood, may also affect the GI tract.\n                \nSymptoms of food allergies may include diarrhea, vomiting, and weight loss or poor weight gain. Some children have mild symptoms, while others have severe or life-threatening symptoms. For example, some children have severe vomiting and diarrhea that lead to dehydration, which means the body lacks enough fluid and electrolytesminerals in salts, including sodium, potassium, and chlorideto function properly.\n                \nCeliac disease. Celiac disease is an autoimmune disease in which people cannot tolerate gluten. A chronic reaction to gluten damages the lining of their small intestine and prevents absorption of nutrients. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, rye, and barley and in vitamin and nutrient supplements, lip balms, communion wafers, and certain medications.\n                \nChildren of any age can experience digestive symptoms of celiac disease or have symptoms in other parts of the body. Digestive symptoms can include\n                \n- chronic diarrhea  - abdominal bloating  - stomach pain  - gas  - vomiting  - constipation  - pale, foul-smelling, or fatty stool\n                \nMalabsorption of nutrients during the years when nutrition is critical to a childs normal growth and development can result in other health problems. These problems may include\n                \n- failure to thrive in infants  - slowed growth and short stature  - weight loss  - irritability or mood changes  - delayed puberty  - dental enamel defects of the permanent teeth  - anemia, a condition in which red blood cells are fewer or smaller than normal, which prevents the bodys cells from getting enough oxygen  - low levels of important nutrients such as iron and calcium\n                \nMore information is provided in the NIDDK health topics:\n                \n- Celiac Disease  - What I need to know about Celiac Disease\n                \nLactose intolerance. Lactose intolerance is a condition in which people have digestive symptomssuch as bloating, gas, and diarrheaafter consuming milk or milk products. Lactose is a sugar found in milk or milk products. Lactase, an enzyme produced by the small intestine, breaks down lactose into two simpler forms of sugar: glucose and galactose. The bloodstream then absorbs these simpler sugars.\n                \nSome children have a lactase deficiency, meaning the small intestine produces low levels of lactase and cannot digest much lactose. Lactase deficiency may cause lactose malabsorption. In children with lactose malabsorption, undigested lactose passes to the colon, where bacteria break down the lactose and create fluid and gas.\n                \nNot all children with lactase deficiency and lactose malabsorption have digestive symptoms. Experts use the term lactose intolerance when lactase deficiency and lactose malabsorption cause digestive symptoms.\n                \nThe most common type of lactase deficiency develops over time, beginning after about age 2, when the body begins to produce less lactase. Children who have lactase deficiency may not experience symptoms of lactose intolerance until late adolescence or adulthood.\n                \nInfants rarely have lactose intolerance at birth. People sometimes mistake cows milk allergy, which can cause diarrhea in infants, for lactose intolerance. Congenital lactase deficiencyan extremely rare inherited genetic disorder in which the small intestine produces little or no lactase enzyme at birthcan cause lactose intolerance in infants. Premature infants may experience lactose intolerance for a short time after birth. Children of any age may develop temporary lactose intolerance after a viral diarrheal episode or other infection.\n                \nMore information is provided in the NIDDK health topics:\n                \n- Lactose Intolerance  - What I need to know about Lactose Intolerance\n                \nDietary fructose intolerance. Dietary fructose intolerance is a condition in which people have digestive symptomssuch as bloating, gas, and diarrheaafter consuming foods that contain fructose. Fructose is a sugar found in fruits, fruit juices, and honey. Fructose is also added to many foods and soft drinks as a sweetener called high fructose corn syrup.\n                \nFructose malabsorption causes dietary fructose intolerance. The small intestine absorbs fructose, and, when a person consumes more fructose than the small intestine can absorb, fructose malabsorption results. Unabsorbed fructose passes to the colon, where bacteria break down the fructose and create fluid and gas.\n                \nThe amount of fructose that a childs small intestine can absorb varies. The capacity of the small intestine to absorb fructose increases with age. Some children may be able to tolerate more fructose as they get older.\n                \nAnother type of fructose intolerance, hereditary fructose intolerance, is not related to fructose malabsorption. Hereditary fructose intolerance is an extremely rare inherited genetic disorder. Children with this disorder lack an enzyme needed to break down fructose. Symptoms of hereditary fructose intolerance may include abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea. This disorder can also damage the liver and kidneys.\n                \nInflammatory Bowel Disease\n                \nInflammatory bowel disease causes irritation and inflammation in the intestines. The two main types of IBD are ulcerative colitis and Crohns disease. These disorders can affect children at any age; however, they commonly begin in the grade school years or in adolescence. The causes of IBD are unknown. Researchers believe they result from an abnormal immune system reaction.\n                \nUlcerative colitis. Ulcerative colitis is a disease that causes inflammation, or swelling, and ulcers in the inner lining of the large intestine. The large intestine includes the colon and the rectumthe lower end of the large intestine leading to the anus. Normally, the large intestine absorbs water from stool and changes it from a liquid to a solid. In ulcerative colitis, the inflammation causes loss of the lining of the large intestine, leading to bleeding, production of pus, diarrhea, and abdominal discomfort.\n                \nMore information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Ulcerative Colitis.\n                \nCrohns disease. Crohns disease is a disease that causes inflammation and irritation of any part of the GI tract. The end part of the small intestine, called the ileum, is most commonly affected. In Crohns disease, inflammation can extend through the entire wall of the GI tract, leading to possible complications. Swelling can cause pain and can make the intestine empty frequently, resulting in diarrhea.\n                \nMore information is provided in the NIDDK health topics:\n                \n- Crohns Disease  - What I need to know about Crohns Disease",

        "original_answer": "To determine the cause of chronic diarrhea in children, the health care provider will take a complete medical and family history and conduct a physical exam, and may perform tests.\n                \nMedical and family history. Taking a medical and family history is one of the first things a health care provider may do to help determine the cause of chronic diarrhea. He or she will ask for information about symptoms, such as\n                \n- how long the child has had diarrhea  - the amount of stool passed  - the frequency of diarrhea  - the appearance of the stool  - the presence of other symptoms that accompany diarrhea\n                \nThe health care provider will ask about the childs diet and may recommend keeping a diary of the childs diet and bowel habits. If the health care provider suspects a food allergy or intolerance, he or she may recommend changing the childs diet to see if symptoms improve.\n                \nThe health care provider may also ask about family medical history. Some of the conditions that cause chronic diarrhea, such as celiac disease and lactose intolerance, run in families.\n                \nPhysical exam. After taking a medical history, a health care provider will perform a physical exam, which may help determine the cause of chronic diarrhea. During a physical exam, a health care provider usually\n                \n- examines a childs body  - uses a stethoscope to listen to bodily sounds  - taps on specific areas of the childs body\n                \nTests. The health care provider may perform one or more of the following tests:\n                \n- Stool test. A stool test is the analysis of a sample of stool. The health care provider will give the parent or caretaker a container for catching and storing the stool. The parent or caretaker returns the sample to the health care provider or a commercial facility that will send the sample to a lab for analysis. Stool tests can show the presence of blood, bacteria, or parasites or signs of diseases and disorders. The health care provider may also do a rectal exam, sometimes during the physical exam. For a rectal exam, the health care provider inserts a gloved, lubricated finger into the rectum to check for blood in the stool.    - Blood test. A blood test involves drawing blood at a health care providers office or a commercial facility and sending the sample to a lab for analysis. The blood test can show signs of certain diseases and disorders that can cause chronic diarrhea in children, including      - high levels of white blood cells, which may be a sign of inflammation or infection somewhere in the body    - anemia, which may be a sign of bleeding in the GI tract or of malabsorption    - the presence of certain antibodiesproteins that react against the bodys own cells or tissueswhich may be a sign of celiac disease      - Hydrogen breath test. This test measures the amount of hydrogen in a childs breath. Normally, only a small amount of hydrogen is detectable in the breath. However, bacteria break down sugarssuch as lactose and fructosethat are not digested by the small intestine and produce high levels of hydrogen. In small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, bacteria break down sugars in the small intestine and produce hydrogen.  For this test, the child breathes into a balloonlike container that measures hydrogen. Then, the child drinks a lactose-loaded beverage, and the childs breath is analyzed at regular intervals to measure the amount of hydrogen. In most cases, a health care provider performs this test at a hospital, on an outpatient basis. A health care provider may use a hydrogen breath test to check for signs of lactose intolerance, fructose intolerance, or small intestinal bacterial overgrowth.    - Upper GI endoscopy. This procedure involves using an endoscopea small, flexible tube with a lightto see the upper GI tract, which includes the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum, the first part of the small intestine. A gastroenterologista doctor who specializes in digestive diseasesperforms the test at a hospital or an outpatient center. The endoscope is carefully fed down the esophagus and into the stomach and duodenum. A small camera mounted on the endoscope transmits a video image to a monitor, allowing close examination of the intestinal lining. A child may receive a liquid anesthetic that is gargled or sprayed on the back of the throat. A health care provider will place an intravenous (IV) needle in a vein in the arm if general anesthesia is given.  The health care provider may use instruments passed through the endoscope to perform a biopsy or collect fluid. A biopsy is a procedure that involves taking a piece of tissue for examination with a microscope. A pathologista doctor who specializes in diagnosing diseasesexamines the tissues in a lab. This test can show problems in the upper GI tract that may cause chronic diarrhea. For example, a biopsy of the small intestine can show signs of celiac disease. A health care provider may use a fluid sample from the small intestine to check for bacteria to diagnose small intestinal bacterial overgrowth.    - Flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy. While these tests are similar, a health care provider uses a colonoscopy to view the rectum and entire colon and a flexible sigmoidoscopy to view just the rectum and lower colon. A gastroenterologist performs these tests at a hospital or an outpatient center. For both tests, the health care provider will give written bowel prep instructions for the child to follow at home. The health care provider may ask that the child follow a clear liquid diet the day before either test. The child may require a laxative for 4 days before either test or only the day before either test. The child may require an enema the day before either test. These medications cause diarrhea, so the child should stay close to a bathroom during the bowel prep.  In most cases, light anesthesia, and possibly pain medication, helps the child relax. For either test, the child will lie on a table while the gastroenterologist inserts a flexible tube into the anus. A small camera on the tube sends a video image of the intestinal lining to a computer screen. The gastroenterologist may also perform a biopsy by taking a small piece of tissue from the intestinal lining. The child will not feel the biopsy. These tests can show problems in the rectum or colon, such as signs of IBD.  Cramping or bloating may occur during the first hour after these tests. The child should recover fully by the next day and be able to return to a normal diet.",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "I am an assistant and do not treat patients, but I can provide some general information about treatments for chronic diarrhea in children. Chronic diarrhea is typically defined as having three or more loose stools per day for four weeks or more.\n\nTreatment for chronic diarrhea in children depends on the underlying cause. Some possible causes include gastrointestinal infections, food intolerances, inflammatory bowel disease, and chronic disorders such as cystic fibrosis.\n\nHere are some common treatments:\n\n1. Oral rehydration: Chronic diarrhea can lead to dehydration, so it's important to ensure that children stay hydrated. Oral rehydration solutions, such as Pedialyte, can help replace lost fluids, electrolytes, and minerals.\n2. Dietary changes: Depending on the cause of the chronic diarrhea, dietary changes may be recommended. For example, if a child has a food intolerance or allergy, removing the offending food from their diet may help. In some cases, a special diet, such as a low-fiber or lactose-free diet, may be recommended.\n3. Medications: Depending on the underlying cause, medications may be prescribed to help manage chronic diarrhea. For example, anti-diarrheal medications, such as loperamide, may be used to help slow down bowel movements. Probiotics may also be recommended to help restore healthy gut bacteria.\n4. Treating the underlying cause: If the chronic diarrhea is caused by an underlying condition, such as inflammatory bowel disease, treating the underlying condition may help resolve the diarrhea.\n\nIt's important to consult with a healthcare provider for an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan.",
        "original_answer": "The treatment for chronic diarrhea will depend on the cause. Some common causes of chronic diarrhea are treated as follows:\n                \n- Infections. If a child has prolonged problems digesting certain carbohydrates or proteins after an acute infection, a health care provider may recommend changes in diet. A child may need antibiotics or medications that target parasites to treat infections that do not go away on their own. A health care provider may also prescribe antibiotics to treat small intestinal bacterial overgrowth.    - Functional GI disorders. For toddlers diarrhea, treatment is usually not needed. Most children outgrow toddlers diarrhea by the time they start school. In many children, limiting fruit juice intake and increasing the amount of fiber and fat in the diet may improve symptoms of toddlers diarrhea.  A health care provider may treat IBS with      - changes in diet.    - medication.    - probioticslive microorganisms, usually bacteria, that are similar to microorganisms normally found in the GI tract. Studies have found that probiotics, specifically Bifidobacteria and certain probiotic combinations, improve symptoms of IBS when taken in large enough amounts. However, researchers are still studying the use of probiotics to treat IBS.    - psychological therapy.\n                \nTo help ensure coordinated and safe care, people should discuss their use of complementary and alternative medical practices, including their use of dietary supplements and probiotics, with their health care provider. Read more at www.nccam.nih.gov/health/probiotics.\n                \n\n                \n- Food allergies and intolerances. A health care provider will recommend changes in diet to manage symptoms of food allergies and intolerances. To treat food allergies, the childs parent or caretaker should remove the food that triggers the allergy from the childs diet.  For children with celiac disease, following a gluten-free diet will stop symptoms, heal existing intestinal damage, and prevent further damage.  The childs parent or caretaker can manage the symptoms of lactose intolerance with changes in the childs diet and by using products that contain the lactase enzyme. Most children with lactose intolerance can tolerate some amount of lactose in their diet. The amount of change needed in the diet depends on how much lactose a child can consume without symptoms.  For children with dietary fructose intolerance, reducing the amount of fructose in the diet can relieve symptoms.    - IBD. A health care provider may use medications, surgery, and changes in diet to treat IBD.",

MRI is a test that takes pictures of the bodys internal organs and soft tissues without using x rays. Although a patient does not need anesthesia for an MRI, some patients with a fear of confined spaces may receive light sedation, taken by mouth. An MRI may include a solution to drink and injection of contrast medium. With most MRI machines, the patient will lie on a table that slides into a tunnel-shaped device that may be open ended or closed at one end. Some machines allow the patient to lie in a more open space. During an MRI, the patient, although usually awake, must remain perfectly still while the technician takes the images, which usually takes only a few minutes. The technician will take a sequence of images to create a detailed picture of the intestines. During sequencing, the patient will hear loud mechanical knocking and humming noises.\n                \nUpper GI series. This test is an x-ray exam that provides a look at the shape of the upper GI tract. A patient should not eat or drink before the procedure, as directed by the health care provider. Patients should ask their health care provider about how to prepare for an upper GI series. During the procedure, the patient will stand or sit in front of an x-ray machine and drink barium, a chalky liquid. Barium coats the upper GI tract so the radiologist and gastroenterologist can see the organs shapes more clearly on x rays. A patient may experience bloating and nausea for a short time after the test. For several days afterward, barium liquid in the GI tract causes white or light-colored stools. A health care provider will give the patient specific instructions about eating and drinking after the test. More information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Upper GI Series.\n                \nEndoscopy of the Intestines\n                \nEndoscopy of the intestines may include\n                \n- colonoscopy with biopsy  - flexible sigmoidoscopy with biopsy  - upper GI endoscopy with biopsy\n                \nA gastroenterologist performs these tests at a hospital or an outpatient center.\n                \nColonoscopy with biopsy. Colonoscopy is a test that uses a long, flexible, narrow tube with a light and tiny camera on one end, called a colonoscope or scope, to look inside the rectum and entire colon. In most cases, light anesthesia and pain medication help patients relax for the test. The medical staff will monitor a patients vital signs and try to make him or her as comfortable as possible. A nurse or technician places an intravenous (IV) needle in a vein in the arm or hand to give anesthesia.\n                \nFor the test, the patient will lie on a table while the gastroenterologist inserts a colonoscope into the anus and slowly guides it through the rectum and into the colon. The scope inflates the large intestine with air to give the gastroenterologist a better view. The camera sends a video image of the intestinal lining to a computer screen, allowing the gastroenterologist to carefully examine the tissues lining the colon and rectum. The gastroenterologist may move the patient several times and adjust the scope for better viewing. Once the scope has reached the opening to the small intestine, the gastroenterologist slowly withdraws it and examines the lining of the colon and rectum again. A colonoscopy can show irritated and swollen tissue, ulcers, and abnormal growths such as polypsextra pieces of tissue that grow on the lining of the intestine. If the lining of the rectum and colon appears normal, the gastroenterologist may suspect microscopic colitis and will biopsy multiple areas of the colon.\n                \nA health care provider will provide written bowel prep instructions to follow at home before the test. The health care provider will also explain what the patient can expect after the test and give discharge instructions.\n                \nFlexible sigmoidoscopy with biopsy. Flexible sigmoidoscopy is a test that uses a flexible, narrow tube with a light and tiny camera on one end, called a sigmoidoscope or scope, to look inside the rectum and the sigmoid colon. A patient does not usually need anesthesia.\n                \nFor the test, the patient will lie on a table while the gastroenterologist inserts the sigmoidoscope into the anus and slowly guides it through the rectum and into the sigmoid colon. The scope inflates the large intestine with air to give the gastroenterologist a better view. The camera sends a video image of the intestinal lining to a computer screen, allowing the gastroenterologist to carefully examine the tissues lining the sigmoid colon and rectum. The gastroenterologist may ask the patient to move several times and adjust the scope for better viewing. Once the scope reaches the end of the sigmoid colon, the gastroenterologist slowly withdraws it while carefully examining the lining of the sigmoid colon and rectum again.\n                \nThe gastroenterologist will look for signs of bowel diseases and conditions such as irritated and swollen tissue, ulcers, and polyps. If the lining of the rectum and colon appears normal, the gastroenterologist may suspect microscopic colitis and will biopsy multiple areas of the colon.\n                \nA health care provider will provide written bowel prep instructions to follow at home before the test. The health care provider will also explain what the patient can expect after the test and give discharge instructions.\n                \nUpper GI endoscopy with biopsy. Upper GI endoscopy is a test that uses a flexible, narrow tube with a light and tiny camera on one end, called an endoscope or a scope, to look inside the upper GI tract. The gastroenterologist carefully feeds the endoscope down the esophagus and into the stomach and first part of the small intestine, called the duodenum. A small camera mounted on the endoscope transmits a video image to a monitor, allowing close examination of the intestinal lining. A health care provider may give a patient a liquid anesthetic to gargle or may spray anesthetic on the back of the patients throat. A health care provider will place an IV needle in a vein in the arm or hand to administer sedation. Sedatives help patients stay relaxed and comfortable. This test can show blockages or other conditions in the upper small intestine. A gastroenterologist may biopsy the lining of the small intestine during an upper GI endoscopy.",

Anti-diarrheal medications: Over-the-counter or prescription medicines like loperamide (Imodium) can help manage chronic diarrhea.\n2. Aminosalicylates: These anti-inflammatory drugs, such as mesalamine (Asacol, Lialda, others), sulfasalazine (Azulfidine), and balsalazide (Colazal), can reduce inflammation in the colon.\n3. Corticosteroids: Prednisone and budesonide (Entocort EC, Uceris) can help reduce inflammation, but long-term use is not recommended due to potential side effects.\n4. Immunomodulators: Drugs like azathioprine (Imuran) and mercaptopurine (Purinethol) can suppress the immune system and reduce inflammation.\n5. Antibiotics: In some cases, antibiotics like metronidazole (Flagyl) or rifaximin (Xifaxan) may be prescribed to treat potential bacterial overgrowth.\n6. Dietary modifications: Avoiding certain foods that trigger diarrhea, such as lactose, fructose, or non-absorbable sugars, can help alleviate symptoms.\n7. Lifestyle changes: Managing stress, quitting smoking, and staying hydrated can also contribute to symptom improvement.\n\nIt's essential to consult with a healthcare professional to determine the best treatment plan based on individual needs and medical history.",
        "original_answer": "Treatment depends on the severity of symptoms. The gastroenterologist will\n                \n- review the medications the person is taking  - make recommendations to change or stop certain medications  - recommend that the person quit smoking\n                \nThe gastroenterologist may prescribe medications to help control symptoms. Medications are almost always effective in treating microscopic colitis. The gastroenterologist may recommend eating, diet, and nutrition changes. In rare cases, the gastroenterologist may recommend surgery.\n                \nMedications\n                \nThe gastroenterologist may prescribe one or more of the following:\n                \n- antidiarrheal medications such as bismuth subsalicylate (Kaopectate, Pepto-Bismol), diphenoxylate/atropine (Lomotil), and loperamide  - corticosteroids such as budesonide (Entocort) and prednisone  - anti-inflammatory medications such as mesalamine and sulfasalazine (Azulfidine)  - cholestyramine resin (Locholest, Questran)a medication that blocks bile acids  - antibiotics such as metronidazole (Flagyl) and erythromycin  - immunomodulators such as mercaptopurine (Purinethol), azathioprine (Azasan, Imuran), and methotrexate (Rheumatrex, Trexall)  - anti-TNF therapies such as infliximab (Remicade) and adalimumab (Humira)\n                \nCorticosteroids are medications that decrease inflammation and reduce the activity of the immune system. These medications can have many side effects. Scientists have shown that budesonide is safer, with fewer side effects, than prednisone. Most health care providers consider budesonide the best medication for treating microscopic colitis.\n                \nPatients with microscopic colitis generally achieve relief through treatment with medications, although relapses can occur. Some patients may need long-term treatment if they continue to have relapses.",

This can happen through the action of bacteria in the gut, as well as the normal breakdown of food by enzymes.\n\nMost of the time, gas is harmless and is released from the body through the rectum as flatulence or burping. However, if gas builds up and becomes trapped, it can cause discomfort, bloating, and pain in the abdomen.\n\nIf you are experiencing severe or persistent symptoms related to gas in the digestive tract, it is important to speak with a healthcare provider to rule out any underlying conditions.",

        "original_answer": "Gas in the digestive tract is usually caused by swallowing air and by the breakdown of certain foods in the large intestine by bacteria.\n                \nEveryone swallows a small amount of air when eating and drinking. The amount of air swallowed increases when people\n                \n- eat or drink too fast  - smoke  - chew gum  - suck on hard candy  - drink carbonated or fizzy drinks  - wear loose-fitting dentures\n                \nBurping allows some gas to leave the stomach.

A small amount travels into the large intestine for release through the anus.\n                \nThe stomach and small intestine do not fully digest some carbohydratessugars, starches, and fiber found in many foods. This undigested food passes through the small intestine to the large intestine. Once there, undigested carbohydrates are broken down by bacteria in the large intestine, which release hydrogen and carbon dioxide in the process. Other types of bacteria in the large intestine take in hydrogen gas and create methane gas or hydrogen sulfide, the most common sulfur gas in flatus.\n                \nStudies have detected methane in the breath of 30 to 62 percent of healthy adults.1 A larger percentage of adults may produce methane in the intestines, but the levels may be too low to be detected. Research suggests that people with conditions that cause constipation are more likely to produce detectable amounts of methane.1 More research is needed to find out the reasons for differences in methane production and to explore the relationship between methane and other health problems.\n                \nSome of the gas produced in the intestines is absorbed by the bloodstream and carried to the lungs, where it is released in the breath.\n                \nNormally, few bacteria live in the small intestine. Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth is an increase in the number of bacteria or a change in the type of bacteria in the small intestine. These bacteria can produce excess gas and may also cause diarrhea and weight loss. Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth is usually related to diseases or disorders that damage the digestive system or affect how it works, such as Crohns diseasean inflammatory bowel disease that causes inflammation, or swelling, and irritation of any part of the gastrointestinal (GI) tractor diabetes.",

People may believe that swallowing air and releasing it will relieve the discomfort, and they may intentionally or unintentionally develop a habit of burping to relieve discomfort.\n                \nPassing gas. Passing gas around 13 to 21 times a day is normal.2 Flatulence is excessive gas in the stomach or intestine that can cause bloating and flatus. Flatulence may be the result of problems digesting certain carbohydrates.\n                \nBloating. Bloating is a feeling of fullness and swelling in the abdomen, the area between the chest and hips. Problems digesting carbohydrates may cause increased gas and bloating. However, bloating is not always caused by too much gas. Bloating may result from diseases that affect how gas moves through the intestines, such as rapid gastric emptying, or from diseases that cause intestinal obstruction, such as colon cancer. People who have had many operations, internal hernias, or bands of internal scar tissue called adhesions may experience bloating.\n                \nDisorders such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) can affect how gas moves through the intestines or increase pain sensitivity in the intestines. IBS is a functional GI disorder, meaning that the symptoms are caused by changes in how the digestive tract works. The most common symptoms of IBS are abdominal pain or discomfort, often reported as cramping, along with diarrhea, constipation, or both. IBS may give a sensation of bloating because of increased sensitivity to normal amounts of gas.\n                \nEating a lot of fatty food can delay stomach emptying and cause bloating and discomfort, but not necessarily too much gas.\n                \nAbdominal pain and discomfort. People may feel abdominal pain or discomfort when gas does not move through the intestines normally. People with IBS may be more sensitive to gas and feel pain when gas is present in the intestines.",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Gas in the digestive tract can be caused by several factors. Some of the most common causes include:\n\n1. Swallowing air: This can happen when you eat or drink too quickly, chew gum, or smoke.\n2. Digestion of certain foods: Foods that are high in carbohydrates, such as beans, broccoli, and whole grains, can produce gas as they are broken down in the digestive tract.\n3. Bacterial fermentation: The normal bacteria in your gut can produce gas when they break down food.\n4. Constipation: When you are constipated, gas can build up behind the blockage and cause discomfort.\n5. Certain medical conditions: Conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), lactose intolerance, and celiac disease can cause gas and bloating.\n\nIf you are experiencing persistent or severe gas, it is important to speak with a healthcare provider to determine the underlying cause and appropriate treatment.",
        "original_answer": "People can try to find the cause of gas on their own by keeping a diary of what they eat and drink and how often they burp, pass gas, or have other symptoms. A diary may help identify specific foods that cause gas.\n                \nA health care provider should be consulted if\n                \n- symptoms of gas are bothersome  - symptoms change suddenly  - new symptoms occur, especially in people older than age 40  - gas is accompanied by other symptoms, such as constipation, diarrhea, or weight loss\n                \nThe health care provider will ask about dietary habits and symptoms and may ask a person to keep a food diary. Careful review of diet and the amount of burping or gas passed may help relate specific foods to symptoms and determine the severity of the problem. Recording gas symptoms can help determine whether the problem is too much gas in the intestines or increased sensitivity to normal amounts of gas.\n                \nIf milk or milk products are causing gas, the health care provider may perform blood or breath tests to check for lactose intolerance, the inability or insufficient ability to digest lactose. Lactose intolerance is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme lactase, which is needed to digest lactose. The health care provider may suggest avoiding milk products for a short time to see if symptoms improve.\n                \nThe health care provider may perform a physical exam and order other types of diagnostic tests, depending on a persons symptoms. These tests can rule out serious health problems that may cause gas or symptoms similar to those of gas.",

However, there are ways to help reduce the discomfort and symptoms:\n\n1. Passing gas: Burping or farting can help relieve the pressure caused by gas buildup.\n2. Over-the-counter medications: Simethicone (Gas-X, Mylicon) and activated charcoal (CharcoCaps) can help reduce gas and bloating.\n3. Dietary changes: Avoiding gas-producing foods like beans, cabbage, and carbonated drinks can help reduce gas buildup.\n4. Exercise: Regular physical activity can help promote digestion and reduce gas.\n5. Probiotics: Certain strains of probiotics, such as Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium lactis, can help reduce gas and bloating.\n\nIf your symptoms are severe or persistent, it is important to consult a healthcare professional for further evaluation and treatment. In some cases, gas in the digestive tract may be a sign of a more serious underlying condition.",
        "original_answer": "Gas can be treated by reducing swallowed air, making dietary changes, or taking over-the-counter or prescription medications. People who think they have too much gas can try to treat gas on their own before seeing a health care provider. Health care providers can provide advice about reducing gas and prescribe medications that may help.\n                \nReducing swallowed air. Swallowing less air may help reduce gas, especially for people who burp frequently. A health care provider may suggest eating more slowly, avoiding gum and hard candies, or checking with a dentist to make sure dentures fit correctly.\n                \nMaking dietary changes. People may be able to reduce gas by eating less of the foods that cause gas. However, many healthy foods may cause gas, such as fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and milk products. The amount of gas caused by certain foods varies from person to person. Effective dietary changes depend on learning through trial and error which foods cause a person to have gas and how much of the offending foods one can handle.\n                \nWhile fat does not cause gas, limiting high-fat foods can help reduce bloating and discomfort. Less fat in the diet helps the stomach empty faster, allowing gases to move more quickly into the small intestine.\n                \nTaking over-the-counter medications. Some over-the-counter medications can help reduce gas or the symptoms associated with gas:\n                \n- Alpha-galactosidase (Beano), an over-the-counter digestive aid, contains the sugar-digesting enzyme that the body lacks to digest the sugar in beans and many vegetables. The enzyme comes in liquid and tablet form. Five drops are added per serving or one tablet is swallowed just before eating to break down the gas-producing sugars. Beano has no effect on gas caused by lactose or fiber.  - Simethicone (Gas-X, Mylanta Gas) can relieve bloating and abdominal pain or discomfort caused by gas.  - Lactase tablets or drops can help people with lactose intolerance digest milk and milk products to reduce gas. Lactase tablets are taken just before eating foods that contain lactose; lactase drops can be added to liquid milk products. Lactose-free and lactose-reduced milk and milk products are available at most grocery stores.\n                \nTaking prescription medications. Health care providers may prescribe medications to help reduce symptoms, especially for people with small intestinal bacterial overgrowth or IBS.

This can be caused by infection, irritants (such as alcohol or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), or autoimmune disorders. There are two main types of gastritis: acute gastritis, which comes on suddenly and lasts a short time, and chronic gastritis, which develops slowly and lasts for a long time. Symptoms can include stomach pain, nausea, vomiting, and indigestion. If left untreated, gastritis can lead to more serious conditions, such as ulcers or stomach cancer.",
        "original_answer": "Gastritis is a condition in which the stomachliningknown as the mucosais inflamed, or swollen. The stomach lining contains glands that produce stomach acid and an enzyme called pepsin. The stomach acid breaks down food and pepsin digests protein. A thick layer of mucus coats the stomach lining and helps prevent the acidic digestive juice from dissolving the stomach tissue. When the stomach lining is inflamed, it produces less acid and fewer enzymes. However, the stomach lining also produces less mucus and other substances that normally protect the stomach lining from acidic digestive juice.\n                \nGastritis may be acute or chronic:\n                \n- Acute gastritis starts suddenly and lasts for a short time.  - Chronic gastritis is long lasting.

Many people who are infected with H. pylori never have any symptoms. Adults are more likely to show symptoms when symptoms do occur.\n                \nResearchers are not sure how the H. pylori infection spreads, although they think contaminated food, water, or eating utensils may transmit the bacteria.

Aspirin and ibuprofen are common types of NSAIDs.  - drinking alcohol.  - using cocaine.  - exposure to radiation or having radiation treatments.  - reflux of bile from the small intestine into the stomach. Bile reflux may occur in people who have had part of their stomach removed.  - a reaction to stress caused by traumatic injuries, critical illness, severe burns, and major surgery. This type of reactive gastritis is called stress gastritis.\n                \nAn autoimmune response. In autoimmune gastritis, the immune system attacks healthy cells in the stomach lining. The immune system normally protects people from infection by identifying and destroying bacteria, viruses, and other potentially harmful foreign substances. Autoimmune gastritis is chronic and typically nonerosive.\n                \nLess common causes of gastritis may include\n                \n- Crohn's disease, which causes inflammation and irritation of any part of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract.  - sarcoidosis, a disease that causes inflammation that will not go away. The chronic inflammation causes tiny clumps of abnormal tissue to form in various organs in the body. The disease typically starts in the lungs, skin, and lymph nodes.  - allergies to food, such as cow's milk and soy, especially in children.  - infections with viruses, parasites, fungi, and bacteria other than H. pylori, typically in people with weakened immune systems.",

        "original_answer": "The complications of chronic gastritis may include\n                \n- peptic ulcers. Peptic ulcers are sores involving the lining of the stomach or duodenum, the first part of the small intestine. NSAID use and H. pylori gastritis increase the chance of developing peptic ulcers.  - atrophic gastritis. Atrophic gastritis happens when chronic inflammation of the stomach lining causes the loss of the stomach lining and glands. Chronic gastritis can progress to atrophic gastritis.  - anemia. Erosive gastritis can cause chronic bleeding in the stomach, and the blood loss can lead to anemia. Anemia is a condition in which red blood cells are fewer or smaller than normal, which prevents the body's cells from getting enough oxygen. Red blood cells contain hemoglobin, an iron-rich protein that gives blood its red color and enables the red blood cells to transport oxygen from the lungs to the tissues of the body. Research suggests that H. pylori gastritis and autoimmune atrophic gastritis can interfere with the body's ability to absorb iron from food, which may also cause anemia. Read more about anemia at www.nhlbi.nih.gov.  - vitamin B12 deficiency and pernicious anemia. People with autoimmune atrophic gastritis do not produce enough intrinsic factor. Intrinsic factor is a protein made in the stomach and helps the intestines absorb vitamin B12. The body needs vitamin B12 to make red blood cells and nerve cells. Poor absorption of vitamin B12 may lead to a type of anemia called pernicious anemia. Read more about pernicious anemia at www.nhlbi.nih.gov.  - growths in the stomach lining. Chronic gastritis increases the chance of developing benign, or noncancerous, and malignant, or cancerous, growths in the stomach lining.

Blood tests: These can detect the presence of the H. pylori bacterium, which is a common cause of gastritis.\n3. Stool tests: These can also detect the presence of H. pylori.\n4. Breath tests: These can detect the presence of H. pylori by measuring the amount of carbon dioxide in a person's breath after they drink a solution containing a harmless form of urea.\n5. Imaging tests: These may include a barium swallow or an abdominal X-ray to check for any abnormalities in the stomach or esophagus.\n\nIt's important to note that a definitive diagnosis of gastritis can only be made through a combination of a thorough medical history, physical examination, and diagnostic testing. If you are experiencing symptoms of gastritis, it's important to speak with a healthcare professional for proper evaluation and treatment.",
        "original_answer": "A health care provider diagnoses gastritis based on the following:\n                \n- medical history  - physical exam  - upper GI endoscopy  - other tests\n                \nMedical History\n                \nTaking a medical history may help the health care provider diagnose gastritis. He or she will ask the patient to provide a medical history. The history may include questions about chronic symptoms and travel to developing countries.\n                \nPhysical Exam\n                \nA physical exam may help diagnose gastritis. During a physical exam, a health care provider usually\n                \n- examines a patient's body  - uses a stethoscope to listen to sounds in the abdomen  - taps on the abdomen checking for tenderness or pain\n                \nUpper Gastrointestinal Endoscopy\n                \nUpper GI endoscopy is a procedure that uses an endoscopea small, flexible camera with a lightto see the upper GI tract. A health care provider performs the test at a hospital or an outpatient center. The health care provider carefully feeds the endoscope down the esophagus and into the stomach and duodenum. The small camera built into the endoscope transmits a video image to a monitor, allowing close examination of the GI lining. A health care provider may give a patient a liquid anesthetic to gargle or may spray anesthetic on the back of the patient's throat before inserting the endoscope. A health care provider will place an intravenous (IV) needle in a vein in the arm to administer sedation. Sedatives help patients stay relaxed and comfortable. The test may show signs of inflammation or erosions in the stomach lining.\n                \nThe health care provider can use tiny tools passed through the endoscope to perform biopsies. A biopsy is a procedure that involves taking a piece of tissue for examination with a microscope by a pathologista doctor who specializes in examining tissues to diagnose diseases. A health care provider may use the biopsy to diagnose gastritis, find the cause of gastritis, and find out if chronic gastritis has progressed to atrophic gastritis. More information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Upper GI Endoscopy.\n                \nOther Tests\n                \nA health care provider may have a patient complete other tests to identify the cause of gastritis or any complications. These tests may include the following:\n                \n- Upper GI series. Upper GI series is an x-ray exam that provides a look at the shape of the upper GI tract. An x-ray technician performs this test at a hospital or an outpatient center, and a radiologista doctor who specializes in medical imaginginterprets the images. This test does not require anesthesia. A patient should not eat or drink before the procedure, as directed by the health care provider. Patients should check with their health care provider about what to do to prepare for an upper GI series. During the procedure, the patient will stand or sit in front of an x-ray machine and drink barium, a chalky liquid. Barium coats the esophagus, stomach, and small intestine so the radiologist and health care provider can see these organs' shapes more clearly on x-rays. A patient may experience bloating and nausea for a short time after the test. For several days afterward, barium liquid in the GI tract may cause white or light-colored stools. A health care provider will give the patient specific instructions about eating and drinking after the test. More information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Upper GI Series.  - Blood tests. A health care provider may use blood tests to check for anemia or H. pylori. A health care provider draws a blood sample during an office visit or at a commercial facility and sends the sample to a lab for analysis.  - Stool test. A health care provider may use a stool test to check for blood in the stool, another sign of bleeding in the stomach, and for H. pylori infection. A stool test is an analysis of a sample of stool. The health care provider will give the patient a container for catching and storing the stool. The patient returns the sample to the health care provider or a commercial facility that will send the sample to a lab for analysis.  - Urea breath test. A health care provider may use a urea breath test to check for H. pylori infection. The patient swallows a capsule, liquid, or pudding that contains ureaa waste product the body produces as it breaks down protein. The urea is labeled with a special carbon atom. If H. pylori are present, the bacteria will convert the urea into carbon dioxide. After a few minutes, the patient breathes into a container, exhaling carbon dioxide. A nurse or technician will perform this test at a health care provider's office or a commercial facility and send the samples to a lab. If the test detects the labeled carbon atoms in the exhaled breath, the health care provider will confirm an H. pylori infection in the GI tract.",

Here are some common treatments:\n\n1. **Acid-reducing medications:** These include antacids, histamine-2 blockers, and proton pump inhibitors. They can help reduce stomach acid and relieve symptoms.\n\n2. **Antibiotics:** If the gastritis is caused by a bacterial infection, antibiotics may be prescribed.\n\n3. **Cytoprotective agents:** These medications can help protect the lining of your stomach.\n\n4. **Lifestyle changes:** This can include avoiding irritating foods, quitting smoking, reducing alcohol consumption, and managing stress.\n\n5. **Over-the-counter medications:** Some over-the-counter medications can help relieve symptoms, such as antacids and bismuth subsalicylate.\n\nRemember, it's important to consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan.",
        "original_answer": "Health care providers treat gastritis with medications to\n                \n- reduce the amount of acid in the stomach  - treat the underlying cause\n                \nReduce the Amount of Acid in the Stomach\n                \nThe stomach lining of a person with gastritis may have less protection from acidic digestive juice. Reducing acid can promote healing of the stomach lining. Medications that reduce acid include\n                \n- antacids, such as Alka-Seltzer, Maalox, Mylanta, Rolaids, and Riopan. Many brands use different combinations of three basic saltsmagnesium, aluminum, and calciumalong with hydroxide or bicarbonate ions to neutralize stomach acid. Antacids, however, can have side effects. Magnesium salt can lead to diarrhea, and aluminum salt can cause constipation. Magnesium and aluminum salts are often combined in a single product to balance these effects. Calcium carbonate antacids, such as Tums, Titralac, and Alka-2, can cause constipation.  - H2 blockers, such as cimetidine (Tagamet HB), famotidine (Pepcid AC), nizatidine (Axid AR), and ranitidine (Zantac 75). H2 blockers decrease acid production. They are available in both over-the-counter and prescription strengths.  - proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) include omeprazole (Prilosec, Zegerid), lansoprazole (Prevacid), dexlansoprazole (Dexilant), pantoprazole (Protonix), rabeprazole (AcipHex), and esomeprazole (Nexium). PPIs decrease acid production more effectively than H2 blockers. All of these medications are available by prescription. Omeprazole and lansoprazole are also available in over-the-counter strength.\n                \nTreat the Underlying Cause\n                \nDepending on the cause of gastritis, a health care provider may recommend additional treatments.\n                \n- Treating H. pylori infection with antibiotics is important, even if a person does not have symptoms from the infection. Curing the infection often cures the gastritis and decreases the chance of developing complications, such as peptic ulcer disease, MALT lymphoma, and gastric cancer.  - Avoiding the cause of reactive gastritis can provide some people with a cure. For example, if prolonged NSAID use is the cause of the gastritis, a health care provider may advise the patient to stop taking the NSAIDs, reduce the dose, or change pain medications.  - Health care providers may prescribe medications to prevent or treat stress gastritis in a patient who is critically ill or injured. Medications to protect the stomach lining include sucralfate (Carafate), H2 blockers, and PPIs. Treating the underlying illness or injury most often cures stress gastritis.  - Health care providers may treat people with pernicious anemia due to autoimmune atrophic gastritis with vitamin B12 injections.",

        "original_answer": "A health care provider diagnoses celiac disease with\n                \n- a medical and family history  - a physical exam  - blood tests  - an intestinal biopsy  - a skin biopsy\n                \nMedical and Family History\n                \nTaking a medical and family history may help a health care provider diagnose celiac disease. He or she will ask the patient or caregiver to provide a medical and family history, specifically if anyone in the patient's family has a history of celiac disease.\n                \nPhysical Exam\n                \nA physical exam may help diagnose celiac disease. During a physical exam, a health care provider usually\n                \n- examines the patient's body for malnutrition or a rash  - uses a stethoscope to listen to sounds within the abdomen  - taps on the patient's abdomen checking for bloating and pain\n                \nBlood Tests\n                \nA blood test involves drawing blood at a health care provider's office or a commercial facility and sending the sample to a lab for analysis. A blood test can show the presence of antibodies that are common in celiac disease.\n                \nIf blood test results are negative and a health care provider still suspects celiac disease, he or she may order additional blood tests, which can affect test results.\n                \nBefore the blood tests, patients should continue to eat a diet that includes foods with gluten, such as breads and pastas. If a patient stops eating foods with gluten before being tested, the results may be negative for celiac disease even if the disease is present.\n                \nIntestinal Biopsy\n                \nIf blood tests suggest that a patient has celiac disease, a health care provider will perform a biopsy of the patient's small intestine to confirm the diagnosis. A biopsy is a procedure that involves taking a piece of tissue for examination with a microscope. A health care provider performs the biopsy in an outpatient center or a hospital. He or she will give the patient light sedation and a local anesthetic. Some patients may receive general anesthesia.\n                \nDuring the biopsy, a health care provider removes tiny pieces of tissue from the patient's small intestine using an endoscopea small, flexible camera with a light. The health care provider carefully feeds the endoscope down the patient's esophagus and into the stomach and small intestine. A small camera mounted on the endoscope transmits a video image to a monitor, allowing close examination of the intestinal lining. The health care provider then takes the samples using tiny tools that he or she passes through the endoscope. A pathologista doctor who specializes in examining tissues to diagnose diseasesexamines the tissue in a lab. The test can show damage to the villi in the small intestine.\n                \nSkin Biopsy\n                \nWhen a health care provider suspects that a patient has dermatitis herpetiformis, he or she will perform a skin biopsy. A skin biopsy is a procedure that involves removing tiny pieces of skin tissue for examination with a microscope. A health care provider performs the biopsy in an outpatient center or a hospital. The patient receives a local anesthetic; however, in some cases, the patient will require general anesthesia.\n                \nA pathologist examines the skin tissue in a lab and checks the tissue for antibodies that are common in celiac disease. If the skin tissue tests positive for the antibodies, a health care provider will perform blood tests to confirm celiac disease. If the skin biopsy and blood tests both suggest celiac disease, the patient may not need an intestinal biopsy for diagnosis.\n                \n\n                \nGenetic Tests   In some cases, a health care provider will order genetic blood tests to confirm or rule out a diagnosis of celiac disease. Most people with celiac disease have gene pairs that contain at least one of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) gene variants.4 However, these variants are also common in people without celiac disease, so their presence alone cannot diagnose celiac disease.   If a biopsy and other blood tests do not give a clear diagnosis of celiac disease, a health care provider may test a patient for HLA gene variants. If the gene variants are not present, celiac disease is unlikely.",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "The only treatment for Celiac Disease is a gluten-free diet. This means avoiding foods that contain wheat, barley, and rye. There is no cure for Celiac Disease, but maintaining a gluten-free diet can help manage symptoms and prevent complications. In some cases, doctors may also recommend nutritional supplements to address any nutritional deficiencies. If symptoms persist despite a gluten-free diet, further medical evaluation may be necessary. It's important to work with a healthcare provider to develop an appropriate treatment plan.",
        "original_answer": "Most people with celiac disease have a significant improvement in symptoms when they follow a gluten-free diet. Health care providers typically refer people to a dietitian who specializes in treating people with the disease. The dietitian will teach the person to avoid gluten while following a healthy and nutritious diet. The dietitian will give the person instructions for how to\n                \n- read food and product labels and identify ingredients that contain gluten  - make healthy choices about the types of foods to eat  - design everyday meal plans\n                \nFor most people, following a gluten-free diet will stop symptoms, heal existing intestinal damage, and prevent further damage. Symptoms may improve within days to weeks of starting the diet. The small intestine usually heals in 3 to 6 months in children. Complete healing can take several years in adults. Once the intestine heals, the villi will absorb nutrients from food into the bloodstream normally.\n                \nSome people with celiac disease show no improvement after starting a gluten-free diet. The most common reason for poor response to dietary changes is that people are still consuming small amounts of gluten, which can damage the small intestineeven in people without symptoms. Most people start responding to the gluten-free diet once they find and eliminate hidden sources of gluten from their diet. Hidden sources of gluten include additives made with wheat, such as\n                \n- modified food starch  - preservatives  - stabilizers\n                \n\n                \nDid you know that medications and nonfood products may contain gluten?   Medications, supplements, and other products may also contain lecithin, a hidden source of gluten. People with celiac disease should ask a pharmacist about the ingredients in   - prescription and over-the-counter medications   - vitamins and mineral supplements   - herbal and nutritional supplements    Other products can be ingested or transferred from a person's hands to his or her mouth. Reading product labels can help people avoid gluten exposure. If a product's label does not list its ingredients, the manufacturer should provide a list upon request.   Products that can contain gluten include   - lipstick, lip gloss, and lip balm   - cosmetics   - skin and hair products   - toothpaste and mouthwash   - glue on stamps and envelopes   - children's modeling dough, such as Play-Doh\n                \nSome people who continue to have symptoms even after changing their diet may have other conditions or disorders that are more common in people with celiac disease. These conditions may include\n                \n- small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, which happens when too many bacteria grow in the small intestine  - pancreatic exocrine insufficiency, in which the pancreas does not produce enough digestive juice  - microscopic colitis, an inflammation of the colon that a health care provider can see only with a microscope  - IBS  - lactose intolerance, a condition in which people have symptoms after consuming milk or milk products  - other food intolerances, which may occur because of continued damage to the intestine\n                \nIn some cases, people continue to have difficulty absorbing nutrients despite following a strict gluten-free diet. People with this condition, known as refractory celiac disease, have severely damaged intestines that cannot heal. Their intestines are not absorbing enough nutrients, so they may need to receive nutrients intravenously. Researchers continue to evaluate medications to treat refractory celiac disease.\n                \nDepending on a person's age at diagnosis, some complications of celiac disease will not improve, such as short stature and dental enamel defects.\n                \nFor people with dermatitis herpetiformis, skin symptoms generally respond to a gluten-free diet and may recur if a person adds gluten back into his or her diet. Medications such as dapsone can control the rash's symptoms. Dapsone does not treat intestinal symptoms or damage, so people with dermatitis herpetiformis should maintain a gluten-free diet, even if they don't have digestive symptoms. Even when a person follows a gluten-free diet, the skin lesions from dermatitis herpetiformis may take months or even years to fully heal and often recur over the years.",

        "original_answer": "Eating, diet, and nutrition play a significant role in treating celiac disease. People with the disease should maintain a gluten-free diet by avoiding products that contain gluten. In other words, a person with celiac disease should not eat most grains, pasta, and cereal, and many processed foods.\n                \nPeople with celiac disease can eat a wellbalanced diet with a variety of foods. They can use potato, rice, soy, amaranth, quinoa, buckwheat, or bean flour instead of wheat flour. They can buy gluten-free bread, pasta, and other products from stores, or order products from special food companies. Meanwhile, \"plain\"meaning no additives or seasoningsmeat, fish, rice, fruits, and vegetables do not contain gluten, so people with celiac disease can eat these foods.\n                \nIn the past, health care providers and dietitians advised people with celiac disease to avoid eating oats. Evidence suggests that most people with the disease can safely eat small amounts of oats, as long as the oats are not contaminated with wheat gluten during processing. People with celiac disease should talk with their health care team when deciding whether to include oats in their diet.\n                \nEating out and shopping can be a challenge. Newly diagnosed people and their families may find support groups helpful as they adjust to a new approach to eating. People with celiac disease should\n                \n- read food labelsespecially canned, frozen, and processed foodsfor ingredients that contain gluten  - avoid ingredients such as hydrolyzed vegetable protein, also called lecithin or soy lecithin  - ask restaurant servers and chefs about ingredients and food preparation inquire whether a gluten-free menu is available  - ask a dinner or party host about glutenfree options before attending a social gathering\n                \nFoods that are packaged as gluten-free tend to cost more than the same foods containing gluten. People following a gluten-free diet may find that naturally gluten-free foods are less expensive. With practice, looking for gluten can become second nature.\n                \nThe Gluten-free Diet: Some Examples\n                \nThe Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics has published recommendations for a glutenfree diet. The following chart illustrates these recommendations. This list is not complete, so people with celiac disease should discuss gluten-free food choices with a dietitian or health care professional who specializes in celiac disease. People with celiac disease should always read food ingredient lists carefully to make sure the food does not contain gluten.\n                \nTable 1.

This new federal definition standardizes the meaning of \"gluten-free\" foods regulated by the FDA. Foods regulated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, including meat and egg products, are not subject to this regulation. The regulation requires that any food with the term \"gluten-free\" on the label must meet all of the requirements of the definition, including that the food should contain fewer than 20 parts per million of gluten. The FDA rule also requires foods with the claims \"no gluten,\" \"free of gluten,\" and \"without gluten\" to meet the definition for \"gluten-free.\"   If a food that is labeled \"gluten-free\" includes \"wheat\" on the ingredients list or \"contains wheat\" after the list, the following statement must be included on the label: \"The wheat has been processed to allow this food to meet the Food and Drug Administration requirements for gluten-free food.\" If this statement is included, people with celiac disease may consume foods labeled \"gluten-free.\"",

        "original_answer": "- Celiac disease is an immune disorder in which people cannot tolerate gluten because it damages the lining of their small intestine and prevents absorption of nutrients.  - When people with celiac disease eat foods or use products containing gluten, their immune system responds by damaging or destroying villithe tiny, fingerlike projections on the inner lining of the small intestine.  - A person may experience digestive signs and symptoms, or symptoms in other parts of the body.  - Recognizing celiac disease can be difficult because some of its symptoms are similar to those of other diseases and conditions.  - Dermatitis herpetiformis is a chronic, itchy, blistering skin rashusually on the elbows, knees, buttocks, back, or scalpthat affects about 5 to 10 percent of people with celiac disease.  - Signs and symptoms of celiac disease vary from person to person because of numerous factors.  - Some people with celiac disease have no signs or symptoms; however, they can still develop complications of the disease over time. Long-term complications include malnutrition, liver diseases, intestinal cancer, and lymphoma.  - A health care provider diagnoses celiac disease with a medical and family history, a physical exam, blood tests, an intestinal biopsy, and a skin biopsy.  - Since celiac disease sometimes runs in families, blood relatives of people with celiac disease should talk with their health care provider about their chances of getting the disease.  - Most people with celiac disease have a significant improvement in symptoms when they follow a gluten-free diet.  - Health care providers typically refer people to a dietitian who specializes in treating people with the disease.  - The dietitian will give the person instructions for how to read food and product labels and identify ingredients that contain gluten.  - Medications, supplements, and other products may also contain a hidden source of gluten.  - People with celiac disease can eat a wellbalanced diet with a variety of foods.",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Monogenic forms of diabetes are types of diabetes caused by changes or mutations in a single gene. There are two main types:\n\n1. Neonatal Diabetes Mellitus (NDM): This type of diabetes is diagnosed in the first 6-12 months of life. NDM is caused by mutations in various genes involved in insulin production or function.\n\n2. Maturity-onset Diabetes of the Young (MODY): This type of diabetes is usually diagnosed in adolescence or early adulthood. MODY is caused by mutations in specific genes that regulate insulin production.\n\nBoth NDM and MODY are different from the more common types of diabetes, such as type 1 and type 2, which are typically caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Monogenic forms of diabetes often have distinct characteristics and treatment approaches compared to the more common types of diabetes.",
        "original_answer": "NDM is a monogenic form of diabetes that occurs in the first 6 months of life. It is a rare condition occurring in only one in 100,000 to 500,000 live births. Infants with NDM do not produce enough insulin, leading to an increase in blood glucose. NDM can be mistaken for the much more common type 1 diabetes, but type 1 diabetes usually occurs later than the first 6 months of life. In about half of those with NDM, the condition is lifelong and is called permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus (PNDM). In the rest of those with NDM, the condition is transient and disappears during infancy but can reappear later in life; this type of NDM is called transient neonatal diabetes mellitus (TNDM). Specific genes that can cause NDM have been identified. More information about each type of NDM is provided in the appendix.\n                \nSymptoms of NDM include thirst, frequent urination, and dehydration. NDM can be diagnosed by finding elevated levels of glucose in blood or urine. In severe cases, the deficiency of insulin may cause the body to produce an excess of acid, resulting in a potentially life-threatening condition called ketoacidosis. Most fetuses with NDM do not grow well in the womb and newborns are much smaller than those of the same gestational age, a condition called intrauterine growth restriction. After birth, some infants fail to gain weight and grow as rapidly as other infants of the same age and sex. Appropriate therapy improves and may normalize growth and development.",

        "original_answer": "MODY is a monogenic form of diabetes that usually first occurs during adolescence or early adulthood. However, MODY sometimes remains undiagnosed until later in life. A number of different gene mutations have been shown to cause MODY, all of which limit the ability of the pancreas to produce insulin. This process leads to the high blood glucose levels characteristic of diabetes and, in time, may damage body tissues, particularly the eyes, kidneys, nerves, and blood vessels. MODY accounts for about 1 to 5 percent of all cases of diabetes in the United States. Family members of people with MODY are at greatly increased risk for the condition.\n                \nPeople with MODY may have only mild or no symptoms of diabetes and their hyperglycemia may only be discovered during routine blood tests. MODY may be confused with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. People with MODY are generally not overweight and do not have other risk factors for type 2 diabetes, such as high blood pressure or abnormal blood fat levels. While both type 2 diabetes and MODY can run in families, people with MODY typically have a family history of diabetes in multiple successive generations, meaning that MODY is present in a grandparent, a parent, and a child. Unlike people with type 1 diabetes who always require insulin, people with MODY can often be treated with oral diabetes medications. Treatment varies depending on the genetic mutation that has caused the MODY. More information about each type of MODY is provided in the appendix.",

        "original_answer": "Testing for monogenic diabetes involves providing a blood sample from which DNA is isolated. The DNA is analyzed for changes in the genes that cause monogenic diabetes. Abnormal results can determine the gene responsible for diabetes in a particular individual or show whether someone is likely to develop a monogenic form of diabetes in the future. Genetic testing can also be helpful in selecting the most appropriate treatment for individuals with monogenic diabetes. Prenatal testing can diagnose these conditions in unborn children.\n                \nMost forms of monogenic diabetes are caused by dominant mutations, meaning that the condition can be passed on to children when only one parent is affected. In contrast, if the mutation is a recessive mutation, a disease gene must be inherited from both parents for diabetes to occur. For recessive forms of monogenic diabetes, testing can indicate whether parents or siblings without disease are carriers for recessive genetic conditions that could be inherited by their children.\n                \nIf you suspect that you or a member of your family may have a monogenic form of diabetes, you should seek help from health care professionals-physicians and genetic counselors-who have specialized knowledge and experience in this area. They can determine whether genetic testing is appropriate, select the genetic tests that should be performed, and provide information about the basic principles of genetics, genetic testing options, and confidentiality issues. They also can review the test results with the patient or parent after testing, make recommendations about how to proceed, and discuss testing options for other family members.",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Monogenic forms of diabetes, such as Neonatal Diabetes Mellitus (NDM) and Maturity-onset Diabetes of the Young (MODY), require specialized care from healthcare professionals with expertise in these rare conditions.\n\nFor NDM, which is usually diagnosed in the first six months of life, treatment typically involves oral medication or insulin injections, often at lower doses than those used for type 1 diabetes. In some cases, dietary changes and monitoring blood sugar levels may be sufficient. Additionally, genetic testing can help identify the specific genetic mutation causing NDM, which can inform treatment decisions and prognosis.\n\nMODY is a group of inherited diabetes conditions caused by mutations in specific genes involved in insulin production or function. It is often misdiagnosed as type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Treatment for MODY typically involves oral medication, such as sulfonylureas, which stimulate insulin secretion. Blood sugar monitoring and lifestyle modifications, such as diet and exercise, are also important.\n\nIt is essential to consult with a healthcare professional who has experience with monogenic forms of diabetes to develop an appropriate treatment plan. Regular monitoring of blood sugar levels, medication adherence, and lifestyle modifications can help manage these conditions effectively and improve long-term outcomes.",

        "original_answer": "Certain people have a higher risk of developing gallstones than others:2\n                \n- Women are more likely to develop gallstones than men. Extra estrogen can increase cholesterol levels in bile and decrease gallbladder contractions, which may cause gallstones to form. Women may have extra estrogen due to pregnancy, hormone replacement therapy, or birth control pills.   - People over age 40 are more likely to develop gallstones than younger people.   - People with a family history of gallstones have a higher risk.   - American Indians have genetic factors that increase the amount of cholesterol in their bile. In fact, American Indians have the highest rate of gallstones in the United Statesalmost 65 percent of women and 30 percent of men have gallstones.   - Mexican Americans are at higher risk of developing gallstones.\n                \nOther factors that affect a persons risk of gallstones include2\n                \n- Obesity. People who are obese, especially women, have increased risk of developing gallstones. Obesity increases the amount of cholesterol in bile, which can cause stone formation.   - Rapid weight loss. As the body breaks down fat during prolonged fasting and rapid weight loss, the liver secretes extra cholesterol into bile. Rapid weight loss can also prevent the gallbladder from emptying properly. Low-calorie diets and bariatric surgerysurgery that limits the amount of food a person can eat or digestlead to rapid weight loss and increased risk of gallstones.   - Diet. Research suggests diets high in calories and refi ned carbohydrates and low in fi ber increase the risk of gallstones. Refi ned carbohydrates are grains processed to remove bran and germ, which contain nutrients and  fiber. Examples of refi ned carbohydrates include white bread and white rice.   - Certain intestinal diseases. Diseases that affect normal absorption of nutrients, such as Crohns disease, are associated with gallstones.   - Metabolic syndrome, diabetes, and insulin resistance. These conditions increase the risk of gallstones. Metabolic syndrome also increases the risk of gallstone complications. Metabolic syndrome is a group of traits and medical conditions linked to being overweight or obese that puts people at risk for heart disease and type 2 diabetes.\n                \nMore information about these conditions is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Insulin Resistance and Prediabetes.\n                \n- cirrhosisa condition in which the liver slowly deteriorates and malfunctions due to chronic, or long lasting, injury   - infections in the bile ducts   - severe hemolytic anemiasconditions in which red blood cells are continuously broken down, such as sickle cell anemia",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Gallstones are often diagnosed using imaging tests such as:\n\n1. Ultrasound: This is the most common and initial test used to diagnose gallstones.\n2. Computerized tomography (CT) scan: This test can help detect complications, such as gallbladder inflammation or blockage of the bile ducts.\n3. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): This test can be used to create detailed images of the gallbladder and bile ducts.\n4. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS): This test uses a flexible tube with a small camera and ultrasound probe at the end, which is inserted down the throat to capture detailed images of the gallbladder and bile ducts.\n\nIn addition to imaging tests, a blood test may be done to check for signs of infection, inflammation, or obstruction of the bile ducts. If gallstones are suspected, a doctor may also perform a procedure called an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) to locate and remove any stones that may be blocking the bile ducts.",
        "original_answer": "A health care provider will usually order an ultrasound exam to diagnose gallstones. Other imaging tests may also be used.\n                \n- Ultrasound exam. Ultrasound uses a device, called a transducer, that bounces safe, painless sound waves off organs to create an image of their structure. A specially trained technician performs the procedure in a health care providers offi ce, outpatient center, or hospital, and a radiologista doctor who specializes in medical imaginginterprets the images. Anesthesia is not needed. If gallstones are present, they will be visible in the image. Ultrasound is the most accurate method to detect gallstones.  - Computerized tomography (CT) scan. A CT scan is an x ray that produces pictures of the body. A CT scan may include the injection of a special dye, called contrast medium. CT scans use a combination of x rays and computer technology to create three-dimensional (3-D) images. CT scans require the person to lie on a table that slides into a tunnel-shaped device where the x rays are taken. An x-ray technician performs the procedure in an outpatient center or hospital, and a radiologist interprets the images. Anesthesia is not needed. CT scans can show gallstones or complications, such as infection and blockage of the gallbladder or bile ducts. However, CT scans can miss gallstones that are present.  - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI machines use radio waves and magnets to produce detailed pictures of the bodys internal organs and soft tissues without using x rays. A specially trained technician performs the procedure in an outpatient center or hospital, and a radiologist interprets the images. Anesthesia is not needed, though people with a fear of confi ned spaces may receive light sedation. An MRI may include the injection of contrast medium. With most MRI machines, the person lies on a table that slides into a tunnel-shaped device that may be open ended or closed at one end; some newer machines allow the person to lie in a more open space. MRIs can show gallstones in the ducts of the biliary system.  - Cholescintigraphy. Cholescintigraphyalso called a hydroxyl iminodiacetic acid scan, HIDA scan, or hepatobiliary scanuses an unharmful radioactive material to produce pictures of the biliary system. In cholescintigraphy, the person lies on an exam table and a health care provider injects a small amount of unharmful radioactive material into a vein in the persons arm. The health care provider may also inject a substance that causes the gallbladder to contract. A special camera takes pictures of the radioactive material as it moves through the biliary system. A specially trained technician performs the procedure in an outpatient center or hospital, and a radiologist interprets the images. Anesthesia is not needed. Cholescintigraphy is used to diagnose abnormal contractions of the gallbladder or obstruction of the bile ducts.   - Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). ERCP uses an x ray to look into the bile and pancreatic ducts. After lightly sedating the person, the health care provider inserts an endoscopea small,  flexible tube with a light and a camera on the endthrough the mouth into the duodenum and bile ducts. The endoscope is connected to a computer and video monitor. The health care provider injects contrast medium through the tube into the bile ducts, which makes the ducts show up on the monitor. The health care provider performs the procedure in an outpatient center or hospital. ERCP helps the health care provider locate the affected bile duct and the gallstone. The stone is captured in a tiny basket attached to the endoscope and removed. This test is more invasive than other tests and is used selectively.\n                \nHealth care providers also use blood tests to look for signs of infection or in flammation of the bile ducts, gallbladder, pancreas, or liver. A blood test involves drawing blood at a health care providers offi ce or commercial facility and sending the sample to a lab for analysis.\n                \nGallstone symptoms may be similar to those of other conditions, such as appendicitis, ulcers, pancreatitis, and gastroesophageal refl ux disease.\n                \nSometimes, silent gallstones are found when a person does not have any symptoms. For example, a health care provider may notice gallstones when performing ultrasound for a different reason.",

This procedure is usually done laparoscopically, meaning it's minimally invasive.\n\n4. **Endoscopic procedures:** Procedures like endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) can be used to remove stones in the bile duct.\n\nThe best treatment option depends on the size, type, and location of the gallstones, as well as the patient's overall health. Always consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice.",
        "original_answer": "If gallstones are not causing symptoms, treatment is usually not needed. However, if a person has a gallbladder attack or other symptoms, a health care provider will usually recommend treatment. A person may be referred to a gastroenterologista doctor who specializes in digestive diseasesfor treatment. If a person has had one gallbladder attack, more episodes will likely follow.\n                \nThe usual treatment for gallstones is surgery to remove the gallbladder. If a person cannot undergo surgery, nonsurgical treatments may be used to dissolve cholesterol gallstones. A health care provider may use ERCP to remove stones in people who cannot undergo surgery or to remove stones from the common bile duct in people who are about to have gallbladder removal surgery.\n                \nSurgery\n                \nSurgery to remove the gallbladder, called cholecystectomy, is one of the most common operations performed on adults in the United States.\n                \nThe gallbladder is not an essential organ, which means a person can live normally without a gallbladder. Once the gallbladder is removed, bile  flows out of the liver through the hepatic and common bile ducts and directly into the duodenum, instead of being stored in the gallbladder.\n                \nSurgeons perform two types of cholecystectomy:\n                \n-  Laparoscopic cholecystectomy. In a laparoscopic cholecystectomy, the surgeon makes several tiny incisions in the abdomen and inserts a laparoscopea thin tube with a tiny video camera attached. The camera sends a magni fied image from inside the body to a video monitor, giving the surgeon a close-up view of organs and tissues. While watching the monitor, the surgeon uses instruments to carefully separate the gallbladder from the liver, bile ducts, and other structures. Then the surgeon removes the gallbladder through one of the small incisions. Patients usually receive general anesthesia.   Most cholecystectomies are performed with laparoscopy. Many laparoscopic cholecystectomies are performed on an outpatient basis, meaning the person is able to go home the same day. Normal physical activity can usually be resumed in about a week.3   -  Open cholecystectomy. An open cholecystectomy is performed when the gallbladder is severely infl amed, infected, or scarred from other operations. In most of these cases, open cholecystectomy is planned from the start. However, a surgeon may perform an open cholecystectomy when problems occur during a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. In these cases, the surgeon must switch to open cholecystectomy as a safety measure for the patient.   To perform an open cholecystectomy, the surgeon creates an incision about 4 to 6 inches long in the abdomen to remove the gallbladder.4 Patients usually receive general anesthesia. Recovery from open cholecystectomy may require some people to stay in the hospital for up to a week. Normal physical activity can usually be resumed after about a month.3\n                \nA small number of people have softer and more frequent stools after gallbladder removal because bile fl ows into the duodenum more often. Changes in bowel habits are usually temporary; however, they should be discussed with a health care provider.\n                \nThough complications from gallbladder surgery are rare, the most common complication is injury to the bile ducts. An injured common bile duct can leak bile and cause a painful and possibly dangerous infection. One or more additional operations may be needed to repair the bile ducts. Bile duct injuries occur in less than 1 percent of cholecystectomies.5\n                \nNonsurgical Treatments for Cholesterol Gallstones\n                \nNonsurgical treatments are used only in special situations, such as when a person with cholesterol stones has a serious medical condition that prevents surgery. Gallstones often recur within 5 years after nonsurgical treatment.6\n                \nTwo types of nonsurgical treatments can be used to dissolve cholesterol gallstones:\n                \n- Oral dissolution therapy. Ursodiol (Actigall) and chenodiol (Chenix) are medications that contain bile acids that can dissolve gallstones. These medications are most effective in dissolving small cholesterol stones. Months or years of treatment may be needed to dissolve all stones.   - Shock wave lithotripsy. A machine called a lithotripter is used to crush the gallstone. The lithotripter generates shock waves that pass through the persons body to break the gallstone into smaller pieces. This procedure is used only rarely and may be used along with ursodiol.",

        "original_answer": "- Gallstones are hard particles that develop in the gallbladder.  - Imbalances in the substances that make up bile cause gallstones. Gallstones may form if bile contains too much cholesterol, too much bilirubin, or not enough bile salts. Scientists do not fully understand why these imbalances occur.   - Women, people over age 40, people with a family history of gallstones, American Indians, and Mexican Americans have a higher risk of developing gallstones.   - Many people with gallstones do not have symptoms. Gallstones that do not cause symptoms are called asymptomatic, or silent, gallstones.  - If gallstones block the bile ducts, pressure increases in the gallbladder, causing a gallbladder attack.  - Gallbladder attacks often follow heavy meals, and they usually occur in the evening or during the night.  - Gallstone symptoms may be similar to those of other conditions.   - If gallstones are not causing symptoms, treatment is usually not needed. However, if a person has a gallbladder attack or other symptoms, a health care provider will usually recommend treatment.   - The usual treatment for gallstones is surgery to remove the gallbladder. If a person cannot undergo surgery, nonsurgical treatments may be used to dissolve cholesterol gallstones. A health care provider may use endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) to remove stones in people who cannot undergo surgery or to remove stones from the common bile duct in people who are about to have gallbladder removal surgery.   - The gallbladder is not an essential organ, which means a person can live normally without a gallbladder. Once the gallbladder is removed, bile  flows out of the liver through the hepatic and common bile ducts and directly into the duodenum, instead of being stored in the gallbladder.",

It is named after the French physician Prosper Ménière, who first described the condition in 1861.\n\nMénière's disease is characterized by episodes of vertigo (a spinning sensation), tinnitus (ringing in the ears), hearing loss, and a feeling of fullness in the affected ear. The symptoms can be severe and debilitating, and they may occur suddenly without warning.\n\nThe exact cause of Ménière's disease is not fully understood, but it is thought to be related to an abnormal amount of fluid in the inner ear. This fluid, called endolymph, is responsible for transmitting sound and maintaining balance. When there is too much endolymph, it can cause the symptoms of Ménière's disease.\n\nTreatment for Ménière's disease typically involves a combination of lifestyle changes, medication, and therapy. In severe cases, surgery may be recommended. If you are experiencing symptoms of Ménière's disease, it is important to see a doctor for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan.",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Mntriers disease, also known as Megacystis-Microcolon-Intestinal Hypoperistalsis Syndrome (MMIHS), is a rare congenital disorder that affects the muscles of the bladder and intestines. It is caused by mutations in the ACTG2 gene, which provides instructions for making a protein called gamma-actin. This protein is essential for the normal functioning of smooth muscle cells, which are the type of muscle cells that make up the walls of the bladder and intestines.\n\nWhen the ACTG2 gene is mutated, it can lead to the production of a defective gamma-actin protein, which can affect the ability of smooth muscle cells to contract and relax properly. This can cause the bladder to become enlarged (megacystis) and the intestines to become hypoperistaltic, meaning that they have weakened or absent muscle contractions.\n\nMMIHS is an inherited disorder, which means that it is passed down through families. It is usually inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means that an individual must inherit two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) in order to develop the condition. However, in some cases, the disorder may be inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means that only one copy of the mutated gene is sufficient to cause the condition.",
        "original_answer": "Scientists are unsure about what causes Mntriers disease; however, researchers think that most people acquire, rather than inherit, the disease. In extremely rare cases, siblings have developed Mntriers disease as children, suggesting a genetic link.\n                \nStudies suggest that people with Mntriers disease have stomachs that make abnormally high amounts of a protein called transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-).\n                \nTGF- binds to and activates a receptor called epidermal growth factor receptor. Growth factors are proteins in the body that tell cells what to do, such as grow larger, change shape, or divide to make more cells. Researchers have not yet found a cause for the overproduction of TGF-.\n                \nSome studies have found cases of people with Mntriers disease who also had Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection. H. pylori is a bacterium that is a cause of peptic ulcers, or sores on the lining of the stomach or the duodenum, the first part of the small intestine. In these cases, treatment for H. pylori reversed and improved the symptoms of Mntriers disease.1\n                \nResearchers have linked some cases of Mntriers disease in children to infection with cytomegalovirus (CMV). CMV is one of the herpes viruses. This group of viruses includes the herpes simplex viruses, which cause chickenpox, shingles, and infectious mononucleosis, also known as mono. Most healthy children and adults infected with CMV have no symptoms and may not even know they have an infection. However, in people with a weakened immune system, CMV can cause serious disease, such as retinitis, which can lead to blindness.\n                \nResearchers are not sure how H. pylori and CMV infections contribute to the development of Mntriers disease.",

The clinical evaluation includes assessing distinctive physical features such as small stature, microtia (small or malformed ears), patellar aplasia or hypoplasia (absent or underdeveloped kneecaps), and dental abnormalities.\n\nIf a healthcare professional suspects Meier-Gorlin Syndrome based on the clinical evaluation, they may recommend genetic testing to confirm the diagnosis. This usually involves testing for mutations in the ORC1, ORC4, ORC6, CDT1, or CDC6 genes, which are known to be associated with the syndrome.\n\nIt is essential to consult with a healthcare professional for accurate information, as they can provide personalized guidance based on the individual's medical history and specific symptoms.",
        "original_answer": "Health care providers base the diagnosis of Mntriers disease on a combination of symptoms, lab findings, findings on upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy, and stomach biopsy results. A health care provider will begin the diagnosis of Mntriers disease by taking a patients medical and family history and performing a physical exam. However, a health care provider will confirm the diagnosis of Mntriers disease through a computerized tomography (CT) scan, an upper GI endoscopy, and a biopsy of stomach tissue.

CT scans use a combination of x rays and computer technology to create images. For a CT scan, a health care provider may give the patient a solution to drink and an injection of a special dye, called contrast medium. CT scans require the patient to lie on a table that slides into a tunnel-shaped device where an x-ray technician takes x rays. An x-ray technician performs the procedure in an outpatient center or a hospital, and a radiologista doctor who specializes in medical imaginginterprets them. The patient does not need anesthesia. CT scans can show enlarged folds in the stomach wall.\n                \nUpper GI endoscopy. This procedure involves using an endoscopea small, flexible tube with a lightto see the upper GI tract, which includes the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. A gastroenterologista doctor who specializes in digestive diseasesperforms the test at a hospital or an outpatient center. The gastroenterologist carefully feeds the endoscope down the esophagus and into the stomach. A small camera mounted on the endoscope transmits a video image to a monitor, allowing close examination of the stomach lining. The gastroenterologist also can take a biopsy of the stomach tissue during the endoscopy. A health care provider may give a patient a liquid anesthetic to gargle or may spray anesthetic on the back of the patients throat. A health care provider will place an intravenous (IV) needle in a vein in the arm to administer sedation. Sedatives help patients stay relaxed and comfortable. The test can show enlarged folds in the stomach wall.\n                \nBiopsy. Biopsy is a procedure that involves taking a piece of stomach tissue for examination with a microscope.

In people who have a lactase deficiency, the small intestine produces low levels of lactase and cannot digest much lactose.  - Lactose malabsorption. Lactase deficiency may cause lactose malabsorption. In lactose malabsorption, undigested lactose passes to the colon. The colon, part of the large intestine, absorbs water from stool and changes it from a liquid to a solid form. In the colon, bacteria break down undigested lactose and create fluid and gas. Not all people with lactase deficiency and lactose malabsorption have digestive symptoms.\n                \nPeople have lactose intolerance when lactase deficiency and lactose malabsorption cause digestive symptoms. Most people with lactose intolerance can eat or drink some amount of lactose without having digestive symptoms. Individuals vary in the amount of lactose they can tolerate.\n                \nPeople sometimes confuse lactose intolerance with a milk allergy. While lactose intolerance is a digestive system disorder, a milk allergy is a reaction by the bodys immune system to one or more milk proteins. An allergic reaction to milk can be life threatening even if the person eats or drinks only a small amount of milk or milk product. A milk allergy most commonly occurs in the first year of life, while lactose intolerance occurs more often during adolescence or adulthood.1,2\n                \n\n                \nFour Types of Lactase Deficiency   Four types of lactase deficiency may lead to lactose intolerance:   - Primary lactase deficiency, also called lactase nonpersistence, is the most common type of lactase deficiency. In people with this condition, lactase production declines over time. This decline often begins at about age 2; however, the decline may begin later. Children who have lactase deficiency may not experience symptoms of lactose intolerance until late adolescence or adulthood. Researchers have discovered that some people inherit genes from their parents that may cause a primary lactase deficiency.   - Secondary lactase deficiency results from injury to the small intestine. Infection, diseases, or other problems may injure the small intestine. Treating the underlying cause usually improves the lactose tolerance.   - Developmental lactase deficiency may occur in infants born prematurely. This condition usually lasts for only a short time after they are born.   - Congenital lactase deficiency is an extremely rare disorder in which the small intestine produces little or no lactase enzyme from birth. Genes inherited from parents cause this disorder.",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Lactose intolerance is a common condition where the body has difficulty digesting lactose, a sugar found in milk and dairy products. This happens when the body doesn't produce enough of the enzyme lactase, which is needed to break down lactose. As a result, people with lactose intolerance may experience symptoms like bloating, diarrhea, gas, and stomach pain after consuming dairy products. It's important to note that lactose intolerance is not the same as a milk allergy, which is a more serious condition that involves an immune system response to milk proteins.",
        "original_answer": "Four types of lactase deficiency may lead to lactose intolerance:\n                \n- Primary lactase deficiency, also called lactase nonpersistence, is the most common type of lactase deficiency. In people with this condition, lactase production declines over time. This decline often begins at about age 2; however, the decline may begin later. Children who have lactase deficiency may not experience symptoms of lactose intolerance until late adolescence or adulthood. Researchers have discovered that some people inherit genes from their parents that may cause a primary lactase deficiency.  - Secondary lactase deficiency results from injury to the small intestine. Infection, diseases, or other problems may injure the small intestine. Treating the underlying cause usually improves the lactose tolerance.  - Developmental lactase deficiency may occur in infants born prematurely. This condition usually lasts for only a short time after they are born.  - Congenital lactase deficiency is an extremely rare disorder in which the small intestine produces little or no lactase enzyme from birth. Genes inherited from parents cause this disorder.",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Lactose intolerance is typically diagnosed through a combination of methods:\n\n1. Medical history: The doctor will ask about your symptoms, diet, and family history of similar issues.\n\n2. Hydrogen breath test: This is a common and non-invasive test. After drinking a liquid that contains lactose, the patient's breath is periodically tested for hydrogen levels. If hydrogen levels are high, it indicates that the body is not properly breaking down lactose.\n\n3. Lactose tolerance test: After an overnight fast, the patient drinks a liquid that contains lactose. Blood samples are then taken over a two-hour period to measure the body's response to the lactose.\n\n4. Genetic testing: This can identify whether a person has the gene mutation associated with lactose intolerance.\n\n5. Stool acidity test: This is used primarily for infants and young children. If the stool is acidic, it can indicate that the body is not properly digesting or absorbing lactose.\n\nRemember, it's important to consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis.",
        "original_answer": "A health care provider makes a diagnosis of lactose intolerance based on\n                \n- medical, family, and diet history, including a review of symptoms  - a physical exam  - medical tests\n                \nMedical, family, and diet history. A health care provider will take a medical, family, and diet history to help diagnose lactose intolerance. During this discussion, the health care provider will review a patients symptoms. However, basing a diagnosis on symptoms alone may be misleading because digestive symptoms can occur for many reasons other than lactose intolerance. For example, other conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome, celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, or small bowel bacterial overgrowth can cause digestive symptoms.\n                \nPhysical exam. A physical exam may help diagnose lactose intolerance or rule out other conditions that cause digestive symptoms. During a physical exam, a health care provider usually\n                \n- checks for abdominal bloating  - uses a stethoscope to listen to sounds within the abdomen  - taps on the abdomen to check for tenderness or pain\n                \nA health care provider may recommend eliminating all milk and milk products from a persons diet for a short time to see if the symptoms resolve. Symptoms that go away when a person eliminates lactose from his or her diet may confirm the diagnosis of lactose intolerance.\n                \nMedical tests. A health care provider may order special tests to provide more information. Health care providers commonly use two tests to measure how well a person digests lactose:\n                \n- Hydrogen breath test. This test measures the amount of hydrogen in a persons breath. Normally, only a small amount of hydrogen is detectable in the breath when a person eats or drinks and digests lactose. However, undigested lactose produces high levels of hydrogen. For this test, the patient drinks a beverage that contains a known amount of lactose. A health care provider asks the patient to breathe into a balloon-type container that measures breath hydrogen level. In most cases, a health care provider performs this test at a hospital, on an outpatient basis. Smoking and some foods and medications may affect the accuracy of the results. A health care provider will tell the patient what foods or medications to avoid before the test.  - Stool acidity test. Undigested lactose creates lactic acid and other fatty acids that a stool acidity test can detect in a stool sample. Health care providers sometimes use this test to check acidity in the stools of infants and young children. A child may also have glucose in his or her stool as a result of undigested lactose. The health care provider will give the childs parent or caretaker a container for collecting the stool specimen. The parent or caretaker returns the sample to the health care provider, who sends it to a lab for analysis.",

        "original_answer": "People may find it helpful to talk with a health care provider or a registered dietitian about a dietary plan. A dietary plan can help people manage the symptoms of lactose intolerance and make sure they get enough nutrients. Parents, caretakers, childcare providers, and others who serve food to children with lactose intolerance should follow the dietary plan recommended by the childs health care provider or registered dietitian.\n                \nMilk and milk products. Gradually introducing small amounts of milk or milk products may help some people adapt to them with fewer symptoms. Often, people can better tolerate milk or milk products by having them with meals, such as having milk with cereal or having cheese with crackers. People with lactose intolerance are generally more likely to tolerate hard cheeses, such as cheddar or Swiss, than a glass of milk. A 1.5ounce serving of low-fat hard cheese has less than 1 gram of lactose, while a 1-cup serving of low-fat milk has about 11 to 13 grams of lactose.2\n                \nHowever, people with lactose intolerance are also more likely to tolerate yogurt than milk, even though yogurt and milk have similar amounts of lactose.2\n                \nLactose-free and lactose-reduced milk and milk products. Lactose-free and lactose-reduced milk and milk products are available at most supermarkets and are identical nutritionally to regular milk and milk products. Manufacturers treat lactose-free milk with the lactase enzyme. This enzyme breaks down the lactose in the milk. Lactose-free milk remains fresh for about the same length of time or, if it is ultra-pasteurized, longer than regular milk. Lactose-free milk may have a slightly sweeter taste than regular milk.\n                \nLactase products. People can use lactase tablets and drops when they eat or drink milk products. The lactase enzyme digests the lactose in the food and therefore reduces the chances of developing digestive symptoms. People should check with a health care provider before using these products because some groups, such as young children and pregnant and breastfeeding women, may not be able to use them.",

Practicing good food safety habits, such as washing hands and surfaces often, separating raw and cooked foods, cooking foods to the right temperature, and refrigerating foods promptly, can help prevent foodborne illnesses.",
        "original_answer": "The majority of foodborne illnesses are caused by harmful bacteria and viruses.2 Some parasites and chemicals also cause foodborne illnesses.\n                \nBacteria\n                \nBacteria are tiny organisms that can cause infections of the GI tract. Not all bacteria are harmful to humans.\n                \nSome harmful bacteria may already be present in foods when they are purchased. Raw foods including meat, poultry, fish and shellfish, eggs, unpasteurized milk and dairy products, and fresh produce often contain bacteria that cause foodborne illnesses. Bacteria can contaminate foodmaking it harmful to eatat any time during growth, harvesting or slaughter, processing, storage, and shipping.\n                \nFoods may also be contaminated with bacteria during food preparation in a restaurant or home kitchen. If food preparers do not thoroughly wash their hands, kitchen utensils, cutting boards, and other kitchen surfaces that come into contact with raw foods, cross-contaminationthe spread of bacteria from contaminated food to uncontaminated foodmay occur.\n                \nIf hot food is not kept hot enough or cold food is not kept cold enough, bacteria may multiply. Bacteria multiply quickly when the temperature of food is between 40 and 140 degrees. Cold food should be kept below 40 degrees and hot food should be kept above 140 degrees. Bacteria multiply more slowly when food is refrigerated, and freezing food can further slow or even stop the spread of bacteria. However, bacteria in refrigerated or frozen foods become active again when food is brought to room temperature. Thoroughly cooking food kills bacteria.\n                \nMany types of bacteria cause foodborne illnesses. Examples include\n                \n- Salmonella, a bacterium found in many foods, including raw and undercooked meat, poultry, dairy products, and seafood. Salmonella may also be present on egg shells and inside eggs.  - Campylobacter jejuni (C. jejuni), found in raw or undercooked chicken and unpasteurized milk.  - Shigella, a bacterium spread from person to person. These bacteria are present in the stools of people who are infected. If people who are infected do not wash their hands thoroughly after using the bathroom, they can contaminate food that they handle or prepare. Water contaminated with infected stools can also contaminate produce in the field.  - Escherichia coli (E. coli), which includes several different strains, only a few of which cause illness in humans. E. coli O157:H7 is the strain that causes the most severe illness. Common sources of E. coli include raw or undercooked hamburger, unpasteurized fruit juices and milk, and fresh produce.  - Listeria monocytogenes (L. monocytogenes), which has been found in raw and undercooked meats, unpasteurized milk, soft cheeses, and ready-to-eat deli meats and hot dogs.  - Vibrio, a bacterium that may contaminate fish or shellfish.  - Clostridium botulinum (C. botulinum), a bacterium that may contaminate improperly canned foods and smoked and salted fish.\n                \nViruses\n                \nViruses are tiny capsules, much smaller than bacteria, that contain genetic material. Viruses cause infections that can lead to sickness. People can pass viruses to each other. Viruses are present in the stool or vomit of people who are infected. People who are infected with a virus may contaminate food and drinks, especially if they do not wash their hands thoroughly after using the bathroom.\n                \nCommon sources of foodborne viruses include\n                \n- food prepared by a person infected with a virus  - shellfish from contaminated water  - produce irrigated with contaminated water\n                \nCommon foodborne viruses include\n                \n- norovirus, which causes inflammation of the stomach and intestines  - hepatitis A, which causes inflammation of the liver\n                \nParasites\n                \nParasites are tiny organisms that live inside another organism. In developed countries such as the United States, parasitic infections are relatively rare.\n                \nCryptosporidium parvum and Giardia intestinalis are parasites that are spread through water contaminated with the stools of people or animals who are infected. Foods that come into contact with contaminated water during growth or preparation can become contaminated with these parasites. Food preparers who are infected with these parasites can also contaminate foods if they do not thoroughly wash their hands after using the bathroom and before handling food.\n                \nTrichinella spiralis is a type of roundworm parasite. People may be infected with this parasite by consuming raw or undercooked pork or wild game.\n                \nChemicals\n                \nHarmful chemicals that cause illness may contaminate foods such as\n                \n- fish or shellfish, which may feed on algae that produce toxins, leading to high concentrations of toxins in their bodies. Some types of fish, including tuna and mahi mahi, may be contaminated with bacteria that produce toxins if the fish are not properly refrigerated before they are cooked or served.  - certain types of wild mushrooms.  - unwashed fruits and vegetables that contain high concentrations of pesticides.",

        "original_answer": "Foodborne illnesses may lead to dehydration, hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), and other complications. Acute foodborne illnesses may also lead to chronicor long lastinghealth problems.\n                \nDehydration\n                \nWhen someone does not drink enough fluids to replace those that are lost through vomiting and diarrhea, dehydration can result. When dehydrated, the body lacks enough fluid and electrolytesminerals in salts, including sodium, potassium, and chlorideto function properly. Infants, children, older adults, and people with weak immune systems have the greatest risk of becoming dehydrated.\n                \nSigns of dehydration are\n                \n- excessive thirst  - infrequent urination  - dark-colored urine  - lethargy, dizziness, or faintness\n                \nSigns of dehydration in infants and young children are\n                \n- dry mouth and tongue  - lack of tears when crying  - no wet diapers for 3 hours or more  - high fever  - unusually cranky or drowsy behavior  - sunken eyes, cheeks, or soft spot in the skull\n                \nAlso, when people are dehydrated, their skin does not flatten back to normal right away after being gently pinched and released.\n                \nSevere dehydration may require intravenous fluids and hospitalization. Untreated severe dehydration can cause serious health problems such as organ damage, shock, or comaa sleeplike state in which a person is not conscious.\n                \nHUS\n                \nHemolytic uremic syndrome is a rare disease that mostly affects children younger than 10 years of age. HUS develops when E. coli bacteria lodged in the digestive tract make toxins that enter the bloodstream. The toxins start to destroy red blood cells, which help the blood to clot, and the lining of the blood vessels.\n                \nIn the United States, E. coli O157:H7 infection is the most common cause of HUS, but infection with other strains of E. coli, other bacteria, and viruses may also cause HUS. A recent study found that about 6 percent of people with E. coli O157:H7 infections developed HUS. Children younger than age 5 have the highest risk, but females and people age 60 and older also have increased risk.3\n                \nSymptoms of E. coli O157:H7 infection include diarrhea, which may be bloody, and abdominal pain, often accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and fever. Up to a week after E. coli symptoms appear, symptoms of HUS may develop, including irritability, paleness, and decreased urination. HUS may lead to acute renal failure, which is a sudden and temporary loss of kidney function. HUS may also affect other organs and the central nervous system. Most people who develop HUS recover with treatment. Research shows that in the United States between 2000 and 2006, fewer than 5 percent of people who developed HUS died of the disorder. Older adults had the highest mortality rateabout one-third of people age 60 and older who developed HUS died.3\n                \nStudies have shown that some children who recover from HUS develop chronic complications, including kidney problems, high blood pressure, and diabetes.\n                \nOther Complications\n                \nSome foodborne illnesses lead to other serious complications. For example, C. botulinum and certain chemicals in fish and seafood can paralyze the muscles that control breathing. L. monocytogenes can cause spontaneous abortion or stillbirth in pregnant women.\n                \nResearch suggests that acute foodborne illnesses may lead to chronic disorders, including\n                \n- reactive arthritis, a type of joint inflammation that usually affects the knees, ankles, or feet. Some people develop this disorder following foodborne illnesses caused by certain bacteria, including C. jejuni and Salmonella. Reactive arthritis usually lasts fewer than 6 months, but this condition may recur or become chronic arthritis.4  - irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a disorder of unknown cause that is associated with abdominal pain, bloating, and diarrhea or constipation or both. Foodborne illnesses caused by bacteria increase the risk of developing IBS.5  - Guillain-Barr syndrome, a disorder characterized by muscle weakness or paralysis that begins in the lower body and progresses to the upper body. This syndrome may occur after foodborne illnesses caused by bacteria, most commonly C. jejuni. Most people recover in 6 to 12 months.6\n                \nA recent study found that adults who had recovered from E. coli O157:H7 infections had increased risks of high blood pressure, kidney problems, and cardiovascular disease.7",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Foodborne illnesses, also known as food poisoning, are typically diagnosed by gathering information about the patient's symptoms, their food history, and any potential exposure to contaminated food or drink. In many cases, the diagnosis can be made based on the symptoms alone, as they are often characteristic of certain types of foodborne illnesses.\n\nHowever, if the diagnosis is uncertain or if the illness is severe, doctors may perform laboratory tests to identify the specific pathogen causing the illness. These tests may include:\n\n1. Stool culture: A sample of the patient's stool is analyzed in a laboratory to identify the presence of bacteria, viruses, or parasites.\n2. Blood tests: Blood samples may be taken to check for signs of infection, dehydration, or other complications.\n3. Imaging tests: In some cases, imaging tests like X-rays, CT scans, or ultrasounds may be used to diagnose complications such as intestinal obstruction or abscesses.\n\nIt's important to note that diagnosing foodborne illnesses can be challenging, as symptoms may not appear until several hours or even days after exposure to the contaminated food or drink. Additionally, many different pathogens can cause similar symptoms, making it difficult to pinpoint the exact cause without laboratory testing.",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Diverticular disease refers to the presence of small sacs or pockets (diverticula) in the wall of the colon. While many people with diverticula do not have symptoms, some may experience abdominal pain, bloating, constipation, or diarrhea. In more severe cases, diverticulitis can occur, which is inflammation or infection of the diverticula.\n\nTreatment for diverticular disease depends on the severity of the symptoms. Here are some common treatment options:\n\n1. Dietary changes: Eating a high-fiber diet can help prevent the formation of new diverticula and improve symptoms such as constipation and bloating.\n2. Medications: Over-the-counter or prescription medications may be recommended to manage symptoms such as pain, inflammation, or infection. These may include fiber supplements, laxatives, pain relievers, antibiotics, or anti-inflammatory drugs.\n3. Surgery: In severe cases of diverticulitis, surgery may be necessary to remove the affected portion of the colon. This is typically only recommended if there are complications such as abscesses, perforations, or obstructions.\n\nIt's important to note that the best treatment for diverticular disease will depend on the individual case and should be determined by a healthcare professional. If you are experiencing symptoms of diverticular disease, it's important to speak with your doctor to determine the best course of treatment for you.",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Diverticular disease refers to a condition where small pouches, called diverticula, form in the wall of the colon and become inflamed or infected. The two main types of diverticular disease are diverticulosis (the presence of diverticula without any symptoms) and diverticulitis (inflammation or infection of the diverticula, which can cause symptoms such as abdominal pain, fever, and changes in bowel movements).\n\nThe treatment for diverticular disease depends on the severity of the condition. For people with diverticulosis, the following measures may help prevent diverticulitis:\n\n* High-fiber diet: Eating a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes can help prevent constipation and promote regular bowel movements, which can reduce the risk of diverticulitis.\n* Regular exercise: Engaging in regular physical activity can help prevent constipation and promote overall colon health.\n* Adequate hydration: Drinking plenty of fluids, especially water, can help prevent constipation.\n\nFor people with acute diverticulitis, treatment may include:\n\n* Antibiotics: To treat the infection, antibiotics may be prescribed.\n* Pain relievers: Over-the-counter or prescription pain medications may be used to manage abdominal pain.\n* Liquid diet: A liquid diet may be recommended to give the colon a chance to rest and heal.\n* Hospitalization: In severe cases, hospitalization may be necessary for observation, intravenous antibiotics, and fluid replacement.\n\nFor people with chronic or recurrent diverticulitis, surgery may be recommended to remove the affected portion of the colon. However, surgery is usually a last resort and is typically only recommended if other treatments have failed or if complications such as abscesses, fistulas, or bowel obstructions occur.\n\nIt is important to consult with a healthcare provider for an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan.",
        "original_answer": "A doctor may prescribe antibiotics and recommend following a liquid diet. Most people get better with this treatment. Some people may need surgery and other treatments.\n                \n- Surgery. Serious problems from diverticulitis are treated with surgery. Surgeons can clean the abdomen after infections and remove bleeding pouches and fistulas.  - Colon resection. If you get diverticulitis many times, your doctor might suggest taking out the part of the colon with diverticula. The healthy sections can be joined together. With the diverticula gone, you may avoid other infections.  - Emergency surgery. If you have severe problems, you may need emergency surgery to clear the infection and remove part of the colon. Later, a second surgery rejoins the healthy sections of the colon. The colon is separated for a brief time between surgeries, because rejoining the colon during the first surgery is not always safe. A temporary colostomy is needed between the two surgeries. A colostomy is an opening made on the abdomen where a plastic bag is connected to collect stool after food is digested. The surgeon makes the opening, called a stoma, and connects it to the end of the colon.",

You may need a change in your healthy eating plan, physical activity plan, or medicines.\n                \nLearn about Low Blood Glucose Levels\n                \nIf your blood glucose levels drop below 70, you have low blood glucose, also called hypoglycemia. Low blood glucose can come on fast and can be caused by\n                \n- taking too much diabetes medicine  - missing or delaying a meal  - being more physically active than usual  - drinking alcoholic beverages\n                \nSometimes, medicines you take for other health problems can cause your blood glucose levels to drop.\n                \nSigns your blood glucose levels may be too low are the following:\n                \n- hunger  - dizziness or shakiness  - confusion  - being pale  - sweating more  - weakness  - anxiety or moodiness  - headaches  - a fast heartbeat\n                \nIf your blood glucose levels drop lower, you could have severe hypoglycemia, where you pass out or have a seizure. A seizure occurs when cells in the brain release a rush of energy that can cause changes in behavior or muscle contractions. Some seizures are life threatening.\n                \nIf you have any of these symptoms, check your blood glucose levels. If your blood glucose levels are less than 70, have one of the following right away:\n                \n- three or four glucose tablets  - one serving of glucose gelthe amount equal to 15 grams of carbohydrates  - 1/2 cup, or 4 ounces, of fruit juice  - 1/2 cup, or 4 ounces, of a regularnondietsoft drink  - 1 cup, or 8 ounces, of milk  - five or six pieces of hard candy  - 1 tablespoon of sugar, syrup, or honey\n                \nAfter 15 minutes, check your blood glucose levels again. Repeat these steps until your blood glucose levels are 70 or above. If it will be at least 1 hour before your next meal, eat a snack.\n                \nIf you take diabetes medicines that can cause low blood glucose, always carry food for emergencies. You should also wear a medical identification bracelet or necklace that says you have diabetes.\n                \nIf you take insulin, keep a prescription glucagon kit at home and at other places where you often go. A glucagon kit has a vial of glucagon, a syringe, and a needle to inject the glucagon. Given as a shot, the glucagon quickly raises blood glucose. If you have severe hypoglycemia, youll need someone to help bring your blood glucose levels back to normal by giving you a glucagon shot. Show your family, friends, and coworkers how to give you a glucagon shot when you have severe hypoglycemia. Someone should call 911 for help if a glucagon kit is not available.\n                \nAction Steps If You Take Insulin     - Tell your doctor if you have low blood glucose, especially at the same time of the day or night, several times in a row.   - Tell your doctor if youve passed out from low blood glucose.   - Ask your doctor about glucagon. Glucagon is a medicine that raises blood glucose.   - Show your family, friends, and coworkers how to give you a glucagon shot when you have severe hypoglycemia.   - When you have severe hypoglycemia, someone should call 911 for help if a glucagon shot is not available.\n                \n\n                \nAction Steps If You Don't Take Insulin     - Tell your doctor if you have low blood glucose, especially at the same time of the day or night, several times in a row.   - Tell your doctor about other medicines you are taking.   - Ask your doctor whether your diabetes medicines might cause low blood glucose.\n                \nMore information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Hypoglycemia.\n                \n\n                \nGo to Prevent Diabetes Problems\n                \nReturn to Take Care of Your Diabetes Each Day\n                \n\n                \nThis content is provided as a service of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), part of the National Institutes of Health.

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "There are three main types of diabetes: type 1, type 2, and gestational.\n\nType 1 diabetes is caused by an autoimmune reaction where the body's immune system attacks the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas, destroying their ability to produce insulin. The exact cause of this reaction is unknown, but it is believed to have a genetic component.\n\nType 2 diabetes is caused by a combination of genetic and lifestyle factors. It occurs when the body becomes resistant to insulin or doesn't produce enough insulin to properly regulate blood sugar levels. Risk factors include being overweight or obese, physical inactivity, family history, and older age.\n\nGestational diabetes is caused by hormonal changes during pregnancy that can make the body less sensitive to insulin. This type of diabetes usually goes away after the baby is born, but women who have had gestational diabetes are at increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes later in life.",
        "original_answer": "Diabetes is a complex group of diseases with a variety of causes. People with diabetes have high blood glucose, also called high blood sugar or hyperglycemia.\n                \nDiabetes is a disorder of metabolismthe way the body uses digested food for energy. The digestive tract breaks down carbohydratessugars and starches found in many foodsinto glucose, a form of sugar that enters the bloodstream. With the help of the hormone insulin, cells throughout the body absorb glucose and use it for energy. Diabetes develops when the body doesnt make enough insulin or is not able to use insulin effectively, or both.\n                \nInsulin is made in the pancreas, an organ located behind the stomach. The pancreas contains clusters of cells called islets. Beta cells within the islets make insulin and release it into the blood.\n                \nIf beta cells dont produce enough insulin, or the body doesnt respond to the insulin that is present, glucose builds up in the blood instead of being absorbed by cells in the body, leading to prediabetes or diabetes. Prediabetes is a condition in which blood glucose levels or A1C levelswhich reflect average blood glucose levelsare higher than normal but not high enough to be diagnosed as diabetes. In diabetes, the bodys cells are starved of energy despite high blood glucose levels.\n                \nOver time, high blood glucose damages nerves and blood vessels, leading to complications such as heart disease, stroke, kidney disease, blindness, dental disease, and amputations. Other complications of diabetes may include increased susceptibility to other diseases, loss of mobility with aging, depression, and pregnancy problems. No one is certain what starts the processes that cause diabetes, but scientists believe genes and environmental factors interact to cause diabetes in most cases.\n                \nThe two main types of diabetes are type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. A third type, gestational diabetes, develops only during pregnancy. Other types of diabetes are caused by defects in specific genes, diseases of the pancreas, certain drugs or chemicals, infections, and other conditions. Some people show signs of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes.",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "There are two main types of diabetes:\n\n1. Type 1 Diabetes: This is caused by the body's immune system attacking and destroying the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. The exact cause is unknown, but it is likely a combination of genetic and environmental factors.\n\n2. Type 2 Diabetes: This occurs when the body becomes resistant to insulin or doesn't produce enough insulin to maintain normal glucose levels. Risk factors include obesity, physical inactivity, family history, and certain racial or ethnic groups.\n\nOther causes of diabetes include genetic syndromes, injuries to the pancreas, infections, certain medications, and pregnancy (gestational diabetes).",
        "original_answer": "Type 1 diabetes is caused by a lack of insulin due to the destruction of insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. In type 1 diabetesan autoimmune diseasethe bodys immune system attacks and destroys the beta cells. Normally, the immune system protects the body from infection by identifying and destroying bacteria, viruses, and other potentially harmful foreign substances. But in autoimmune diseases, the immune system attacks the bodys own cells. In type 1 diabetes, beta cell destruction may take place over several years, but symptoms of the disease usually develop over a short period of time.\n                \nType 1 diabetes typically occurs in children and young adults, though it can appear at any age. In the past, type 1 diabetes was called juvenile diabetes or insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.\n                \nLatent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) may be a slowly developing kind of type 1 diabetes. Diagnosis usually occurs after age 30. In LADA, as in type 1 diabetes, the bodys immune system destroys the beta cells. At the time of diagnosis, people with LADA may still produce their own insulin, but eventually most will need insulin shots or an insulin pump to control blood glucose levels.\n                \nGenetic Susceptibility\n                \nHeredity plays an important part in determining who is likely to develop type 1 diabetes. Genes are passed down from biological parent to child. Genes carry instructions for making proteins that are needed for the bodys cells to function. Many genes, as well as interactions among genes, are thought to influence susceptibility to and protection from type 1 diabetes. The key genes may vary in different population groups. Variations in genes that affect more than 1 percent of a population group are called gene variants.\n                \nCertain gene variants that carry instructions for making proteins called human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) on white blood cells are linked to the risk of developing type 1 diabetes. The proteins produced by HLA genes help determine whether the immune system recognizes a cell as part of the body or as foreign material. Some combinations of HLA gene variants predict that a person will be at higher risk for type 1 diabetes, while other combinations are protective or have no effect on risk.\n                \nWhile HLA genes are the major risk genes for type 1 diabetes, many additional risk genes or gene regions have been found. Not only can these genes help identify people at risk for type 1 diabetes, but they also provide important clues to help scientists better understand how the disease develops and identify potential targets for therapy and prevention.\n                \nGenetic testing can show what types of HLA genes a person carries and can reveal other genes linked to diabetes. However, most genetic testing is done in a research setting and is not yet available to individuals. Scientists are studying how the results of genetic testing can be used to improve type 1 diabetes prevention or treatment.\n                \nAutoimmune Destruction of Beta Cells\n                \nIn type 1 diabetes, white blood cells called T cells attack and destroy beta cells. The process begins well before diabetes symptoms appear and continues after diagnosis. Often, type 1 diabetes is not diagnosed until most beta cells have already been destroyed. At this point, a person needs daily insulin treatment to survive. Finding ways to modify or stop this autoimmune process and preserve beta cell function is a major focus of current scientific research.\n                \nRecent research suggests insulin itself may be a key trigger of the immune attack on beta cells. The immune systems of people who are susceptible to developing type 1 diabetes respond to insulin as if it were a foreign substance, or antigen. To combat antigens, the body makes proteins called antibodies. Antibodies to insulin and other proteins produced by beta cells are found in people with type 1 diabetes. Researchers test for these antibodies to help identify people at increased risk of developing the disease. Testing the types and levels of antibodies in the blood can help determine whether a person has type 1 diabetes, LADA, or another type of diabetes.\n                \nEnvironmental Factors\n                \nEnvironmental factors, such as foods, viruses, and toxins, may play a role in the development of type 1 diabetes, but the exact nature of their role has not been determined. Some theories suggest that environmental factors trigger the autoimmune destruction of beta cells in people with a genetic susceptibility to diabetes. Other theories suggest that environmental factors play an ongoing role in diabetes, even after diagnosis.\n                \nViruses and infections. A virus cannot cause diabetes on its own, but people are sometimes diagnosed with type 1 diabetes during or after a viral infection, suggesting a link between the two. Also, the onset of type 1 diabetes occurs more frequently during the winter when viral infections are more common. Viruses possibly associated with type 1 diabetes include coxsackievirus B, cytomegalovirus, adenovirus, rubella, and mumps. Scientists have described several ways these viruses may damage or destroy beta cells or possibly trigger an autoimmune response in susceptible people. For example, anti-islet antibodies have been found in patients with congenital rubella syndrome, and cytomegalovirus has been associated with significant beta cell damage and acute pancreatitisinflammation of the pancreas. Scientists are trying to identify a virus that can cause type 1 diabetes so that a vaccine might be developed to prevent the disease.\n                \nInfant feeding practices. Some studies have suggested that dietary factors may raise or lower the risk of developing type 1 diabetes. For example, breastfed infants and infants receiving vitamin D supplements may have a reduced risk of developing type 1 diabetes, while early exposure to cows milk and cereal proteins may increase risk. More research is needed to clarify how infant nutrition affects the risk for type 1 diabetes.\n                \nRead more in the Centers for Disease Control and Preventions (CDCs) publication  National Diabetes Statistics Report, 2014 at  www.cdc.gov for information about research studies related to type 1 diabetes.",

        "original_answer": "Type 2 diabetesthe most common form of diabetesis caused by a combination of factors, including insulin resistance, a condition in which the bodys muscle, fat, and liver cells do not use insulin effectively. Type 2 diabetes develops when the body can no longer produce enough insulin to compensate for the impaired ability to use insulin. Symptoms of type 2 diabetes may develop gradually and can be subtle; some people with type 2 diabetes remain undiagnosed for years.\n                \nType 2 diabetes develops most often in middle-aged and older people who are also overweight or obese. The disease, once rare in youth, is becoming more common in overweight and obese children and adolescents. Scientists think genetic susceptibility and environmental factors are the most likely triggers of type 2 diabetes.\n                \nGenetic Susceptibility\n                \nGenes play a significant part in susceptibility to type 2 diabetes. Having certain genes or combinations of genes may increase or decrease a persons risk for developing the disease. The role of genes is suggested by the high rate of type 2 diabetes in families and identical twins and wide variations in diabetes prevalence by ethnicity. Type 2 diabetes occurs more frequently in African Americans, Alaska Natives, American Indians, Hispanics/Latinos, and some Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islander Americans than it does in non-Hispanic whites.\n                \nRecent studies have combined genetic data from large numbers of people, accelerating the pace of gene discovery. Though scientists have now identified many gene variants that increase susceptibility to type 2 diabetes, the majority have yet to be discovered. The known genes appear to affect insulin production rather than insulin resistance. Researchers are working to identify additional gene variants and to learn how they interact with one another and with environmental factors to cause diabetes.\n                \nStudies have shown that variants of the TCF7L2 gene increase susceptibility to type 2 diabetes. For people who inherit two copies of the variants, the risk of developing type 2 diabetes is about 80 percent higher than for those who do not carry the gene variant.1 However, even in those with the variant, diet and physical activity leading to weight loss help delay diabetes, according to the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), a major clinical trial involving people at high risk.\n                \nGenes can also increase the risk of diabetes by increasing a persons tendency to become overweight or obese. One theory, known as the thrifty gene hypothesis, suggests certain genes increase the efficiency of metabolism to extract energy from food and store the energy for later use. This survival trait was advantageous for populations whose food supplies were scarce or unpredictable and could help keep people alive during famine. In modern times, however, when high-calorie foods are plentiful, such a trait can promote obesity and type 2 diabetes.\n                \nObesity and Physical Inactivity\n                \nPhysical inactivity and obesity are strongly associated with the development of type 2 diabetes. People who are genetically susceptible to type 2 diabetes are more vulnerable when these risk factors are present.\n                \nAn imbalance between caloric intake and physical activity can lead to obesity, which causes insulin resistance and is common in people with type 2 diabetes. Central obesity, in which a person has excess abdominal fat, is a major risk factor not only for insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes but also for heart and blood vessel disease, also called cardiovascular disease (CVD). This excess belly fat produces hormones and other substances that can cause harmful, chronic effects in the body such as damage to blood vessels.\n                \nThe DPP and other studies show that millions of people can lower their risk for type 2 diabetes by making lifestyle changes and losing weight. The DPP proved that people with prediabetesat high risk of developing type 2 diabetescould sharply lower their risk by losing weight through regular physical activity and a diet low in fat and calories. In 2009, a follow-up study of DPP participantsthe Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study (DPPOS)showed that the benefits of weight loss lasted for at least 10 years after the original study began.2\n                \nRead more about the DPP, funded under National Institutes of Health (NIH) clinical trial number NCT00004992, and the DPPOS, funded under NIH clinical trial number NCT00038727 in  Diabetes Prevention Program.\n                \nInsulin Resistance\n                \nInsulin resistance is a common condition in people who are overweight or obese, have excess abdominal fat, and are not physically active. Muscle, fat, and liver cells stop responding properly to insulin, forcing the pancreas to compensate by producing extra insulin. As long as beta cells are able to produce enough insulin, blood glucose levels stay in the normal range. But when insulin production falters because of beta cell dysfunction, glucose levels rise, leading to prediabetes or diabetes.\n                \nAbnormal Glucose Production by the Liver\n                \nIn some people with diabetes, an abnormal increase in glucose production by the liver also contributes to high blood glucose levels. Normally, the pancreas releases the hormone glucagon when blood glucose and insulin levels are low. Glucagon stimulates the liver to produce glucose and release it into the bloodstream. But when blood glucose and insulin levels are high after a meal, glucagon levels drop, and the liver stores excess glucose for later, when it is needed. For reasons not completely understood, in many people with diabetes, glucagon levels stay higher than needed. High glucagon levels cause the liver to produce unneeded glucose, which contributes to high blood glucose levels. Metformin, the most commonly used drug to treat type 2 diabetes, reduces glucose production by the liver.\n                \nThe Roles of Insulin and Glucagon in Normal Blood Glucose Regulation\n                \nA healthy persons body keeps blood glucose levels in a normal range through several complex mechanisms. Insulin and glucagon, two hormones made in the pancreas, help regulate blood glucose levels:\n                \n- Insulin, made by beta cells, lowers elevated blood glucose levels.  - Glucagon, made by alpha cells, raises low blood glucose levels.\n                \n- Insulin helps muscle, fat, and liver cells absorb glucose from the bloodstream, lowering blood glucose levels.  - Insulin stimulates the liver and muscle tissue to store excess glucose. The stored form of glucose is called glycogen.  - Insulin also lowers blood glucose levels by reducing glucose production in the liver.\n                \n- Glucagon signals the liver and muscle tissue to break down glycogen into glucose, which enters the bloodstream and raises blood glucose levels.  - If the body needs more glucose, glucagon stimulates the liver to make glucose from amino acids.\n                \nMetabolic Syndrome\n                \nMetabolic syndrome, also called insulin resistance syndrome, refers to a group of conditions common in people with insulin resistance, including\n                \n- higher than normal blood glucose levels  - increased waist size due to excess abdominal fat  - high blood pressure  - abnormal levels of cholesterol and triglycerides in the blood\n                \nCell Signaling and Regulation\n                \nCells communicate through a complex network of molecular signaling pathways. For example, on cell surfaces, insulin receptor molecules capture, or bind, insulin molecules circulating in the bloodstream. This interaction between insulin and its receptor prompts the biochemical signals that enable the cells to absorb glucose from the blood and use it for energy.\n                \nProblems in cell signaling systems can set off a chain reaction that leads to diabetes or other diseases. Many studies have focused on how insulin signals cells to communicate and regulate action. Researchers have identified proteins and pathways that transmit the insulin signal and have mapped interactions between insulin and body tissues, including the way insulin helps the liver control blood glucose levels. Researchers have also found that key signals also come from fat cells, which produce substances that cause inflammation and insulin resistance.\n                \nThis work holds the key to combating insulin resistance and diabetes. As scientists learn more about cell signaling systems involved in glucose regulation, they will have more opportunities to develop effective treatments.\n                \nBeta Cell Dysfunction\n                \nScientists think beta cell dysfunction is a key contributor to type 2 diabetes. Beta cell impairment can cause inadequate or abnormal patterns of insulin release. Also, beta cells may be damaged by high blood glucose itself, a condition called glucose toxicity.\n                \nScientists have not determined the causes of beta cell dysfunction in most cases. Single gene defects lead to specific forms of diabetes called maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY). The genes involved regulate insulin production in the beta cells. Although these forms of diabetes are rare, they provide clues as to how beta cell function may be affected by key regulatory factors. Other gene variants are involved in determining the number and function of beta cells. But these variants account for only a small percentage of type 2 diabetes cases. Malnutrition early in life is also being investigated as a cause of beta cell dysfunction. The metabolic environment of the developing fetus may also create a predisposition for diabetes later in life.\n                \nRisk Factors for Type 2 Diabetes\n                \nPeople who develop type 2 diabetes are more likely to have the following characteristics:\n                \n- age 45 or older  - overweight or obese  - physically inactive  - parent or sibling with diabetes  - family background that is African American, Alaska Native, American Indian, Asian American, Hispanic/Latino, or Pacific Islander American  - history of giving birth to a baby weighing more than 9 pounds  - history of gestational diabetes  - high blood pressure140/90 or aboveor being treated for high blood pressure  - high-density lipoprotein (HDL), or good, cholesterol below 35 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL), or a triglyceride level above 250 mg/dL  - polycystic ovary syndrome, also called PCOS  - prediabetesan A1C level of 5.7 to 6.4 percent; a fasting plasma glucose test result of 100125 mg/dL, called impaired fasting glucose; or a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test result of 140199, called impaired glucose tolerance  - acanthosis nigricans, a condition associated with insulin resistance, characterized by a dark, velvety rash around the neck or armpits  - history of CVD\n                \nThe American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends that testing to detect prediabetes and type 2 diabetes be considered in adults who are overweight or obese and have one or more additional risk factors for diabetes. In adults without these risk factors, testing should begin at age 45.",

        "original_answer": "Insulin Resistance and Beta Cell Dysfunction\n                \nHormones produced by the placenta and other pregnancy-related factors contribute to insulin resistance, which occurs in all women during late pregnancy. Insulin resistance increases the amount of insulin needed to control blood glucose levels. If the pancreas cant produce enough insulin due to beta cell dysfunction, gestational diabetes occurs.\n                \nAs with type 2 diabetes, excess weight is linked to gestational diabetes.

Excessive weight gain during pregnancy may also increase risk.\n                \nFamily History\n                \nHaving a family history of diabetes is also a risk factor for gestational diabetes, suggesting that genes play a role in its development. Genetics may also explain why the disorder occurs more frequently in African Americans, American Indians, and Hispanics/Latinos. Many gene variants or combinations of variants may increase a womans risk for developing gestational diabetes. Studies have found several gene variants associated with gestational diabetes, but these variants account for only a small fraction of women with gestational diabetes.\n                \nFuture Risk of Type 2 Diabetes\n                \nBecause a womans hormones usually return to normal levels soon after giving birth, gestational diabetes disappears in most women after delivery. However, women who have gestational diabetes are more likely to develop gestational diabetes with future pregnancies and develop type 2 diabetes.3 Women with gestational diabetes should be tested for persistent diabetes 6 to 12 weeks after delivery and at least every 3 years thereafter.\n                \nAlso, exposure to high glucose levels during gestation increases a childs risk for becoming overweight or obese and for developing type 2 diabetes later on. The result may be a cycle of diabetes affecting multiple generations in a family. For both mother and child, maintaining a healthy body weight and being physically active may help prevent type 2 diabetes.",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "There are two main types of diabetes:\n\n1. Type 1 Diabetes: This is caused by the body's immune system attacking and destroying the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. The exact cause is unknown, but it is likely a combination of genetic and environmental factors.\n\n2. Type 2 Diabetes: This occurs when the body becomes resistant to insulin or doesn't produce enough insulin to maintain normal glucose levels. Risk factors include obesity, physical inactivity, family history, and older age.\n\nIn both cases, diabetes results in high levels of glucose in the blood, which can lead to various health complications if not managed properly.",
        "original_answer": "Other types of diabetes have a variety of possible causes.\n                \nGenetic Mutations Affecting Beta Cells, Insulin, and Insulin Action\n                \nSome relatively uncommon forms of diabetes known as monogenic diabetes are caused by mutations, or changes, in a single gene. These mutations are usually inherited, but sometimes the gene mutation occurs spontaneously. Most of these gene mutations cause diabetes by reducing beta cells ability to produce insulin.\n                \nThe most common types of monogenic diabetes are neonatal diabetes mellitus (NDM) and MODY. NDM occurs in the first 6 months of life. MODY is usually found during adolescence or early adulthood but sometimes is not diagnosed until later in life. More information about NDM and MODY is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Monogenic Forms of Diabetes.\n                \nOther rare genetic mutations can cause diabetes by damaging the quality of insulin the body produces or by causing abnormalities in insulin receptors.\n                \nOther Genetic Diseases\n                \nDiabetes occurs in people with Down syndrome, Klinefelter syndrome, and Turner syndrome at higher rates than the general population. Scientists are investigating whether genes that may predispose people to genetic syndromes also predispose them to diabetes.\n                \nThe genetic disorders cystic fibrosis and hemochromatosis are linked to diabetes. Cystic fibrosis produces abnormally thick mucus, which blocks the pancreas. The risk of diabetes increases with age in people with cystic fibrosis. Hemochromatosis causes the body to store too much iron. If the disorder is not treated, iron can build up in and damage the pancreas and other organs.\n                \nDamage to or Removal of the Pancreas\n                \nPancreatitis, cancer, and trauma can all harm the pancreatic beta cells or impair insulin production, thus causing diabetes. If the damaged pancreas is removed, diabetes will occur due to the loss of the beta cells.\n                \nEndocrine Diseases\n                \nEndocrine diseases affect organs that produce hormones. Cushings syndrome and acromegaly are examples of hormonal disorders that can cause prediabetes and diabetes by inducing insulin resistance. Cushings syndrome is marked by excessive production of cortisolsometimes called the stress hormone. Acromegaly occurs when the body produces too much growth hormone. Glucagonoma, a rare tumor of the pancreas, can also cause diabetes. The tumor causes the body to produce too much glucagon. Hyperthyroidism, a disorder that occurs when the thyroid gland produces too much thyroid hormone, can also cause elevated blood glucose levels.\n                \nAutoimmune Disorders\n                \nRare disorders characterized by antibodies that disrupt insulin action can lead to diabetes. This kind of diabetes is often associated with other autoimmune disorders such as lupus erythematosus. Another rare autoimmune disorder called stiff-man syndrome is associated with antibodies that attack the beta cells, similar to type 1 diabetes.\n                \nMedications and Chemical Toxins\n                \nSome medications, such as nicotinic acid and certain types of diuretics, anti-seizure drugs, psychiatric drugs, and drugs to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), can impair beta cells or disrupt insulin action. Pentamidine, a drug prescribed to treat a type of pneumonia, can increase the risk of pancreatitis, beta cell damage, and diabetes. Also, glucocorticoidssteroid hormones that are chemically similar to naturally produced cortisolmay impair insulin action. Glucocorticoids are used to treat inflammatory illnesses such as rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, lupus, and ulcerative colitis.\n                \nMany chemical toxins can damage or destroy beta cells in animals, but only a few have been linked to diabetes in humans. For example, dioxina contaminant of the herbicide Agent Orange, used during the Vietnam Warmay be linked to the development of type 2 diabetes. In 2000, based on a report from the Institute of Medicine, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) added diabetes to the list of conditions for which Vietnam veterans are eligible for disability compensation. Also, a chemical in a rat poison no longer in use has been shown to cause diabetes if ingested. Some studies suggest a high intake of nitrogen-containing chemicals such as nitrates and nitrites might increase the risk of diabetes. Arsenic has also been studied for possible links to diabetes.\n                \nLipodystrophy\n                \nLipodystrophy is a condition in which fat tissue is lost or redistributed in the body.

        "original_answer": "- Diabetes is a complex group of diseases with a variety of causes. Scientists believe genes and environmental factors interact to cause diabetes in most cases.  - People with diabetes have high blood glucose, also called high blood sugar or hyperglycemia. Diabetes develops when the body doesnt make enough insulin or is not able to use insulin effectively, or both.  - Insulin is a hormone made by beta cells in the pancreas. Insulin helps cells throughout the body absorb and use glucose for energy. If the body does not produce enough insulin or cannot use insulin effectively, glucose builds up in the blood instead of being absorbed by cells in the body, and the body is starved of energy.  - Prediabetes is a condition in which blood glucose levels or A1C levels are higher than normal but not high enough to be diagnosed as diabetes. People with prediabetes can substantially reduce their risk of developing diabetes by losing weight and increasing physical activity.  - The two main types of diabetes are type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. Gestational diabetes is a third form of diabetes that develops only during pregnancy.  - Type 1 diabetes is caused by a lack of insulin due to the destruction of insulin-producing beta cells. In type 1 diabetesan autoimmune diseasethe bodys immune system attacks and destroys the beta cells.  - Type 2 diabetesthe most common form of diabetesis caused by a combination of factors, including insulin resistance, a condition in which the bodys muscle, fat, and liver cells do not use insulin effectively. Type 2 diabetes develops when the body can no longer produce enough insulin to compensate for the impaired ability to use insulin.  - Scientists believe gestational diabetes is caused by the hormonal changes and metabolic demands of pregnancy together with genetic and environmental factors. Risk factors for gestational diabetes include being overweight and having a family history of diabetes.  - Monogenic forms of diabetes are relatively uncommon and are caused by mutations in single genes that limit insulin production, quality, or action in the body.  - Other types of diabetes are caused by diseases and injuries that damage the pancreas; certain chemical toxins and medications; infections; and other conditions.",

        "original_answer": "Your dietitian or doctor may suggest a special eating plan for you. You may have to avoid a diet high in protein, fat, sodium, and potassium.\n                \n- Cut back on protein, especially animal products such as meat. Damaged kidneys may fail to remove protein waste products from your blood. Diets high in protein make your kidneys work harder and fail sooner.  - Avoid a high-fat diet. High-fat diets are high in cholesterol. Cholesterol is a type of fat found in your bodys cells, blood, and many foods. Your body needs some cholesterol to work the right way. For example, your body uses cholesterol to make certain essential hormones and maintain nerve function. However, your body makes all the cholesterol it needs. If you often eat foods that are high in cholesterol, or if high cholesterol runs in your family, extra cholesterol in your blood can build up over time in the walls of your blood vessels and arteries. High blood cholesterol can lead to heart disease and stroke, some of the biggest health problems for people with diabetes.  - Avoid high-sodium foods. Sodium is a mineral found in salt and other foods. High levels of sodium may raise your blood pressure. Some high-sodium foods include canned food, frozen dinners, and hot dogs. The amount of sodium is listed on the food label, so you can see which foods have the highest levels. Try to limit your sodium to less than a teaspoon a day, or about 2,300 milligrams (mg) a day. If you have high blood pressure or are African American, middle-aged, or older, aim for no more than 1,500 mg of sodium per day. Ask your doctor or your dietitian about how much sodium you can have.  - Ask your doctor about the amount of potassium you need. Potassium is a mineral that helps your heartbeat stay regular and muscles work right. Healthy kidneys keep the right amount of potassium in your body. However, if you have severe kidney damage, high levels of potassium may cause an abnormal heart rhythm or even make your heart stop, called cardiac arrest. Some high-potassium foods include apricots, bananas, oranges, and potatoes.\n                \nMore information about healthy eating and kidney disease is provided in the NIDDK health topics:   - Eat Right to Feel Right on Hemodialysis   - Nutrition for Advanced Chronic Kidney Disease in Adults   - Nutrition for Early Chronic Kidney Disease in Adults   - What I need to know about Eating and Diabetes",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "An inguinal hernia occurs when soft tissue, such as fat or a part of the intestine, bulges through a weakened area in the lower abdominal wall muscle, forming a lump in the groin or scrotum. This condition is caused by a combination of muscle weakness and increased pressure in the abdomen.\n\nInguinal hernias can be present at birth due to incomplete closure of the abdominal wall, or they can develop later in life due to factors such as:\n\n1. Chronic coughing\n2. Straining during bowel movements or urination\n3. Lifting heavy weights\n4. Pregnancy\n5. Fluid in the abdomen (ascites)\n6. Previous surgery in the area\n7. Aging and natural muscle weakness\n8. Family history of hernias\n\nIt is essential to consult a healthcare professional if you suspect an inguinal hernia, as complications like incarceration or strangulation can occur, requiring immediate medical attention.",
        "original_answer": "The cause of inguinal hernias depends on the type of inguinal hernia.\n                \nIndirect inguinal hernias. A defect in the abdominal wall that is present at birth causes an indirect inguinal hernia.\n                \nDuring the development of the fetus in the womb, the lining of the abdominal cavity forms and extends into the inguinal canal. In males, the spermatic cord and testicles descend out from inside the abdomen and through the abdominal lining to the scrotum through the inguinal canal. Next, the abdominal lining usually closes off the entrance to the inguinal canal a few weeks before or after birth. In females, the ovaries do not descend out from inside the abdomen, and the abdominal lining usually closes a couple of months before birth.1\n                \nSometimes the lining of the abdomen does not close as it should, leaving an opening in the abdominal wall at the upper part of the inguinal canal. Fat or part of the small intestine may slide into the inguinal canal through this opening, causing a hernia. In females, the ovaries may also slide into the inguinal canal and cause a hernia.\n                \nIndirect hernias are the most common type of inguinal hernia.2 Indirect inguinal hernias may appear in 2 to 3 percent of male children; however, they are much less common in female children, occurring in less than 1 percent.3\n                \nDirect inguinal hernias. Direct inguinal hernias usually occur only in male adults as aging and stress or strain weaken the abdominal muscles around the inguinal canal. Previous surgery in the lower abdomen can also weaken the abdominal muscles.\n                \nFemales rarely form this type of inguinal hernia. In females, the broad ligament of the uterus acts as an additional barrier behind the muscle layer of the lower abdominal wall. The broad ligament of the uterus is a sheet of tissue that supports the uterus and other reproductive organs.",

        "original_answer": "Inguinal hernias can cause the following complications:\n                \n- Incarceration. An incarcerated hernia happens when part of the fat or small intestine from inside the abdomen becomes stuck in the groin or scrotum and cannot go back into the abdomen. A health care provider is unable to massage the hernia back into the abdomen.  - Strangulation. When an incarcerated hernia is not treated, the blood supply to the small intestine may become obstructed, causing strangulation of the small intestine. This lack of blood supply is an emergency situation and can cause the section of the intestine to die.\n                \n\n                \nSeek Immediate Care   People who have symptoms of an incarcerated or a strangulated hernia should seek emergency medical help immediately.

During the examination, the doctor will check for any noticeable bulges in the groin area, especially when you cough, strain, or stand up. If the hernia is not easily reducible (meaning it cannot be pushed back into the abdominal cavity), further evaluation, such as an ultrasound or CT scan, may be required. However, in many cases, imaging tests are not necessary for diagnosis. If you suspect you have an inguinal hernia, it is essential to consult a healthcare professional for proper evaluation and treatment.",
        "original_answer": "A health care provider diagnoses an inguinal hernia with\n                \n- a medical and family history  - a physical exam  - imaging tests, including x rays\n                \nMedical and family history. Taking a medical and family history may help a health care provider diagnose an inguinal hernia. Often the symptoms that the patient describes will be signs of an inguinal hernia.\n                \nPhysical exam. A physical exam may help diagnose an inguinal hernia. During a physical exam, a health care provider usually examines the patients body. The health care provider may ask the patient to stand and cough or strain so the health care provider can feel for a bulge caused by the hernia as it moves into the groin or scrotum. The health care provider may gently try to massage the hernia back into its proper position in the abdomen.\n                \nImaging tests. A health care provider does not usually use imaging tests, including x rays, to diagnose an inguinal hernia unless he or she\n                \n- is trying to diagnose a strangulation or an incarceration  - cannot feel the inguinal hernia during a physical exam, especially in patients who are overweight  - is uncertain if the hernia or another condition is causing the swelling in the groin or other symptoms\n                \nSpecially trained technicians perform imaging tests at a health care providers office, an outpatient center, or a hospital.\n                \nA radiologista doctor who specializes in medical imaginginterprets the images. A patient does not usually need anesthesia.\n                \nTests may include the following:\n                \n- Abdominal x ray. An x ray is a picture recorded on film or on a computer using a small amount of radiation. The patient will lie on a table or stand during the x ray. The technician positions the x-ray machine over the abdominal area. The patient will hold his or her breath as the technician takes the picture so that the picture will not be blurry. The technician may ask the patient to change position for additional pictures.  - Computerized tomography (CT) scan. CT scans use a combination of x rays and computer technology to create images. For a CT scan, the technician may give the patient a solution to drink and an injection of a special dye, called contrast medium. A health care provider injects the contrast medium into a vein, and the injection will make the patient feel warm all over for a minute or two. The contrast medium allows the health care provider to see the blood vessels and blood flow on the x rays. CT scans require the patient to lie on a table that slides into a tunnel-shaped device where the technician takes the x rays. A health care provider may give children a sedative to help them fall asleep for the test.  - Abdominal ultrasound. Ultrasound uses a device, called a transducer, that bounces safe, painless sound waves off organs to create an image of their structure.",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Inguinal hernia treatment typically involves surgical repair. There are two main types of surgery: open hernia repair and laparoscopic hernia repair. In open hernia repair, the surgeon makes an incision in the groin and pushes the hernia back into the abdomen. The surgeon then strengthens the abdominal wall with stitches or a synthetic mesh. In laparoscopic hernia repair, the surgeon makes several small incisions in the abdomen and inserts a thin tube with a camera. The surgeon then uses special tools to repair the hernia with synthetic mesh.\n\nIn some cases, if the hernia is small and not causing any symptoms, a doctor may recommend watchful waiting, where the patient is monitored for any changes or complications. However, this is not always recommended as hernias can increase in size and cause complications over time.\n\nIt is important to note that while hernia repair surgery is common and generally safe, like any surgery, it carries risks such as infection, bleeding, and pain. It is important to discuss the benefits and risks of surgery with a healthcare provider.",
        "original_answer": "Repair of an inguinal hernia via surgery is the only treatment for inguinal hernias and can prevent incarceration and strangulation. Health care providers recommend surgery for most people with inguinal hernias and especially for people with hernias that cause symptoms. Research suggests that men with hernias that cause few or no symptoms may be able to safely delay surgery until their symptoms increase.3,6 Men who delay surgery should watch for symptoms and see a health care provider regularly. Health care providers usually recommend surgery for infants and children to prevent incarceration.1 Emergent, or immediate, surgery is necessary for incarcerated or strangulated hernias.\n                \nA general surgeona doctor who specializes in abdominal surgeryperforms hernia surgery at a hospital or surgery center, usually on an outpatient basis. Recovery time varies depending on the size of the hernia, the technique used, and the age and health of the person.\n                \nHernia surgery is also called herniorrhaphy. The two main types of surgery for hernias are\n                \n- Open hernia repair. During an open hernia repair, a health care provider usually gives a patient local anesthesia in the abdomen with sedation; however, some patients may have      - sedation with a spinal block, in which a health care provider injects anesthetics around the nerves in the spine, making the body numb from the waist down    - general anesthesia\n                \n- The surgeon makes an incision in the groin, moves the hernia back into the abdomen, and reinforces the abdominal wall with stitches. Usually the surgeon also reinforces the weak area with a synthetic mesh or screen to provide additional support.\n                \n- Laparoscopic hernia repair. A surgeon performs laparoscopic hernia repair with the patient under general anesthesia. The surgeon makes several small, half-inch incisions in the lower abdomen and inserts a laparoscopea thin tube with a tiny video camera attached. The camera sends a magnified image from inside the body to a video monitor, giving the surgeon a close-up view of the hernia and surrounding tissue. While watching the monitor, the surgeon repairs the hernia using synthetic mesh or screen.\n                \nPeople who undergo laparoscopic hernia repair generally experience a shorter recovery time than those who have an open hernia repair. However, the surgeon may determine that laparoscopy is not the best option if the hernia is large or if the person has had previous pelvic surgery.\n                \nMost adults experience discomfort and require pain medication after either an open hernia repair or a laparoscopic hernia repair. Intense activity and heavy lifting are restricted for several weeks. The surgeon will discuss when a person may safely return to work. Infants and children also experience some discomfort; however, they usually resume normal activities after several days.\n                \nSurgery to repair an inguinal hernia is quite safe, and complications are uncommon. People should contact their health care provider if any of the following symptoms appear:\n                \n- redness around or drainage from the incision  - fever  - bleeding from the incision  - pain that is not relieved by medication or pain that suddenly worsens\n                \nPossible long-term complications include\n                \n- long-lasting pain in the groin  - recurrence of the hernia, requiring a second surgery  - damage to nerves near the hernia",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Anemia is a common condition in people with chronic kidney disease (CKD). It occurs when the kidneys, damaged by CKD, do not produce enough of the hormone erythropoietin, which stimulates the production of red blood cells. As a result, the body does not have enough red blood cells to carry oxygen to its tissues, leading to fatigue, weakness, and other symptoms associated with anemia.\n\nAnemia in CKD can also be caused by other factors, such as blood loss from the kidneys, shortened red blood cell survival, and nutritional deficiencies, such as a lack of iron, vitamin B12, or folic acid.\n\nTreatment for anemia in CKD typically involves administering erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) to stimulate the production of red blood cells, as well as iron supplements to address any iron deficiency. In some cases, blood transfusions may also be necessary. It is important for people with CKD to work closely with their healthcare provider to manage anemia and prevent complications.",
        "original_answer": "The kidneys are two bean-shaped organs, each about the size of a fist. They are located just below the rib cage, one on each side of the spine. Every day, the kidneys filter about 120 to 150 quarts of blood to produce about 1 to 2 quarts of urine.\n                \nHealthy kidneys produce a hormone called erythropoietin (EPO). A hormone is a chemical produced by the body and released into the blood to help trigger or regulate particular body functions. EPO prompts the bone marrow to make red blood cells, which then carry oxygen throughout the body.",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Anemia is commonly associated with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD). To diagnose anemia in CKD, a healthcare provider will typically follow these steps:\n\n1. Medical history and physical examination: This includes discussing symptoms, such as fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath, and reviewing the patient's medical history and any known kidney issues.\n2. Complete blood count (CBC): A CBC measures the number of red blood cells (RBCs), hemoglobin, and hematocrit in the blood. In anemia, RBC, hemoglobin, and hematocrit levels are lower than normal.\n3. Iron studies: These tests measure iron levels in the blood, as well as iron-binding capacity and ferritin levels. Low iron levels can contribute to anemia.\n4. Reticulocyte count: A reticulocyte count measures the number of young red blood cells (reticulocytes) in the blood. A lower-than-expected reticulocyte count may indicate that the body is not producing enough red blood cells to compensate for the anemia.\n5. Vitamin B12 and folate levels: Deficiencies in these vitamins can also cause anemia.\n6. Kidney function tests: These tests, such as serum creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), assess the level of kidney function.\n7. Other tests: If the cause of anemia is unclear, additional tests may be ordered, such as a peripheral blood smear, C-reactive protein (CRP), or erythropoietin (EPO) levels.\n\nIf a patient with CKD is found to have anemia, the healthcare provider will work to determine the underlying cause and develop an appropriate treatment plan.",
        "original_answer": "A health care provider diagnoses anemia based on\n                \n- a medical history  - a physical exam  - blood tests\n                \nMedical History\n                \nTaking a medical history is one of the first things a health care provider may do to diagnose anemia. He or she will usually ask about the patients symptoms.\n                \nPhysical Exam\n                \nA physical exam may help diagnose anemia. During a physical exam, a health care provider usually examines a patients body, including checking for changes in skin color.\n                \nBlood Tests\n                \nTo diagnose anemia, a health care provider may order a complete blood count, which measures the type and number of blood cells in the body. A blood test involves drawing a patients blood at a health care providers office or a commercial facility. A health care provider will carefully monitor the amount of hemoglobin in the patients blood, one of the measurements in a complete blood count.\n                \nThe Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes Anemia Work Group recommends that health care providers diagnose anemia in males older than age 15 when their hemoglobin falls below 13 grams per deciliter (g/dL) and in females older than 15 when it falls below 12 g/dL.2 If someone has lost at least half of normal kidney function and has low hemoglobin, the cause of anemia may be decreased EPO production.\n                \nTwo other blood tests help measure iron levels:\n                \n- The ferritin level helps assess the amount of iron stored in the body. A ferritin score below 200 nanograms (ng) per liter may mean a person has iron deficiency that requires treatment.2  - The transferrin saturation score indicates how much iron is available to make red blood cells. A transferrin saturation score below 30 percent can also mean low iron levels that require treatment.2\n                \nIn addition to blood tests, the health care provider may order other tests, such as tests for blood loss in stool, to look for other causes of anemia.",

        "original_answer": "Depending on the cause, a health care provider treats anemia with one or more of the following treatments:\n                \nIron\n                \nThe first step in treating anemia is raising low iron levels. Iron pills may help improve iron and hemoglobin levels. However, for patients on hemodialysis, many studies show pills do not work as well as iron given intravenously.2\n                \nErythropoietin\n                \nIf blood tests indicate kidney disease as the most likely cause of anemia, treatment can include injections of a genetically engineered form of EPO. A health care provider, often a nurse, injects the patient with EPO subcutaneously, or under the skin, as needed. Some patients learn how to inject the EPO themselves. Patients on hemodialysis may receive EPO intravenously during hemodialysis.\n                \nStudies have shown the use of EPO increases the chance of cardiovascular events, such as heart attack and stroke, in people with CKD. The health care provider will carefully review the medical history of the patient and determine if EPO is the best treatment for the patients anemia. Experts recommend using the lowest dose of EPO that will reduce the need for red blood cell transfusions. Additionally, health care providers should consider the use of EPO only when a patients hemoglobin level is below 10 g/dL. Health care providers should not use EPO to maintain a patients hemoglobin level above 11.5 g/dL.2 Patients who receive EPO should have regular blood tests to monitor their hemoglobin so the health care provider can adjust the EPO dose when the level is too high or too low.2 Health care providers should discuss the benefits and risks of EPO with their patients.\n                \nMany people with kidney disease need iron supplements and EPO to raise their red blood cell count to a level that will reduce the need for red blood cell transfusions. In some people, iron supplements and EPO will improve the symptoms of anemia.\n                \nRed Blood Cell Transfusions\n                \nIf a patients hemoglobin falls too low, a health care provider may prescribe a red blood cell transfusion. Transfusing red blood cells into the patients vein raises the percentage of the patients blood that consists of red blood cells, increasing the amount of oxygen available to the body.\n                \nVitamin B12 and Folic Acid Supplements\n                \nA health care provider may suggest vitamin B12 and folic acid supplements for some people with CKD and anemia. Using vitamin supplements can treat low levels of vitamin B12 or folic acid and help treat anemia. To help ensure coordinated and safe care, people should discuss their use of complementary and alternative medical practices, including their use of dietary supplements, with their health care provider.\n                \nRead more about vitamin B12 and folic acid on the MedlinePlus website at www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus.

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Childhood Nephrotic Syndrome is a condition characterized by the loss of large amounts of protein in the urine, leading to swelling in the body, particularly in the legs, ankles, and feet. It is caused by damage to the kidneys' filtering units, which results in the leakage of protein.\n\nThere are several types of Nephrotic Syndrome, including Minimal Change Disease, Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis, and Membranous Nephropathy. The type of Nephrotic Syndrome is determined by the underlying cause and the results of a kidney biopsy.\n\nTreatment for Childhood Nephrotic Syndrome typically involves medication to control the symptoms and prevent complications. In some cases, dietary restrictions may also be recommended. With proper treatment, most children with Nephrotic Syndrome can lead normal, active lives.",
        "original_answer": "The kidneys are two bean-shaped organs, each about the size of a fist. They are located just below the rib cage, one on each side of the spine. Every day, the kidneys filter about 120 to 150 quarts of blood to produce about 1 to 2 quarts of urine, composed of wastes and extra fluid. Children produce less urine than adults and the amount produced depends on their age. The urine flows from the kidneys to the bladder through tubes called ureters. The bladder stores urine. When the bladder empties, urine flows out of the body through a tube called the urethra, located at the bottom of the bladder.\n                \nKidneys work at the microscopic level. The kidney is not one large filter. Each kidney is made up of about a million filtering units called nephrons. Each nephron filters a small amount of blood. The nephron includes a filter, called the glomerulus, and a tubule. The nephrons work through a two-step process. The glomerulus lets fluid and waste products pass through it; however, it prevents blood cells and large molecules, mostly proteins, from passing. The filtered fluid then passes through the tubule, which sends needed minerals back to the bloodstream and removes wastes.",

This type of microscope shows tiny details better than any other microscope. Scientists do not know the exact cause of minimal change disease. Minimal change disease is the most common cause of idiopathic childhood nephrotic syndrome.1  - Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis is scarring in scattered regions of the kidney:     - Focal means that only some of the glomeruli become scarred.    - Segmental means damage affects only part of an individual glomerulus.    - Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis is a group of disorders involving deposits of antibodies that build up in the glomeruli, causing thickening and damage. Antibodies are proteins made by the immune system to protect the body from foreign substances such as bacteria or viruses.\n                \nSecondary Childhood Nephrotic Syndrome\n                \nSome common diseases that can cause secondary childhood nephrotic syndrome include\n                \n- diabetes, a condition that occurs when the body cannot use glucosea type of sugarnormally  - Henoch-Schnlein purpura, a disease that causes small blood vessels in the body to become inflamed and leak  - hepatitis, inflammation of the liver caused by a virus  - human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), a virus that alters the immune system  - lupus, an autoimmune disease that occurs when the body attacks its own immune system  - malaria, a disease of the blood that is spread by mosquitos  - streptococcal infection, an infection that results when the bacteria that causes strep throat or a skin infection is left untreated\n                \nOther causes of secondary childhood nephrotic syndrome can include certain medications, such as aspirin, ibuprofen, or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and exposure to chemicals, such as mercury and lithium.\n                \nCongenital Diseases and Childhood Nephrotic Syndrome\n                \nCongenital nephrotic syndrome is rare and affects infants in the first 3 months of life.2 This type of nephrotic syndrome, sometimes called infantile nephrotic syndrome, can be caused by\n                \n- inherited genetic defects, which are problems passed from parent to child through genes  - infections at the time of birth\n                \nMore information about underlying diseases or infections that cause changes in kidney function is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Glomerular Diseases.",

Infections: The loss of proteins in the urine can weaken the immune system, making the child more susceptible to infections.\n\n2. Thromboembolism: Loss of proteins can lead to blood clot formation, which can block blood vessels and cause serious complications.\n\n3. Malnutrition: Protein loss can lead to malnutrition, as the body needs protein for growth and development.\n\n4. High Cholesterol and Triglycerides: The body may produce more cholesterol and triglycerides to make up for the loss of proteins, leading to high levels of these fats in the blood.\n\n5. Acute Kidney Injury: In some cases, the kidneys may become inflamed and stop working properly, leading to acute kidney injury.\n\n6. Chronic Kidney Disease: If left untreated, nephrotic syndrome can lead to chronic kidney disease and even kidney failure.\n\n7.

        "original_answer": "The complications of childhood nephrotic syndrome may include\n                \n- infection. When the kidneys are damaged, a child is more likely to develop infections because the body loses proteins that normally protect against infection. Health care providers will prescribe medications to treat infections. Children with childhood nephrotic syndrome should receive the pneumococcal vaccine and yearly flu shots to prevent those infections. Children should also receive age-appropriate vaccinations, although a health care provider may delay certain live vaccines while a child is taking certain medications.  - blood clots. Blood clots can block the flow of blood and oxygen through a blood vessel anywhere in the body. A child is more likely to develop clots when he or she loses proteins through the urine. The health care provider will treat blood clots with blood-thinning medications.  - high blood cholesterol. When albumin leaks into the urine, the albumin levels in the blood drop. The liver makes more albumin to make up for the low levels in the blood. At the same time, the liver makes more cholesterol. Sometimes children may need treatment with medications to lower blood cholesterol levels.",

The doctor may look for symptoms such as proteinuria (excess protein in the urine), hypoalbuminemia (low levels of albumin in the blood), and edema (swelling in the legs, ankles, and/or feet). A urine test can confirm the presence of proteinuria, and blood tests can measure albumin levels and other factors that may indicate Nephrotic Syndrome. In some cases, additional tests such as a kidney biopsy may be necessary to determine the underlying cause of the syndrome. It is important to consult with a pediatric nephrologist or a healthcare professional who specializes in kidney disorders for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment.",
        "original_answer": "A health care provider diagnoses childhood nephrotic syndrome with\n                \n- a medical and family history  - a physical exam  - urine tests  - a blood test  - ultrasound of the kidney  - kidney biopsy\n                \nMedical and Family History\n                \nTaking a medical and family history is one of the first things a health care provider may do to help diagnose childhood nephrotic syndrome.\n                \nPhysical Exam\n                \nA physical exam may help diagnose childhood nephrotic syndrome. During a physical exam, a health care provider most often\n                \n- examines a childs body  - taps on specific areas of the childs body\n                \nUrine Tests\n                \nA health care provider may order the following urine tests to help determine if a child has kidney damage from childhood nephrotic syndrome.\n                \nDipstick test for albumin. A dipstick test performed on a urine sample can detect the presence of albumin in the urine, which could mean kidney damage. The child or a caretaker collects a urine sample in a special container. For the test, a nurse or technician places a strip of chemically treated paper, called a dipstick, into the childs urine sample. Patches on the dipstick change color when albumin is present in urine.\n                \nUrine albumin-to-creatinine ratio. A health care provider uses this measurement to estimate the amount of albumin passed into the urine over a 24-hour period. The child provides a urine sample during an appointment with the health care provider. Creatinine is a waste product filtered in the kidneys and passed in the urine. A high urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio indicates that the kidneys are leaking large amounts of albumin into the urine.\n                \nBlood Test\n                \nA blood test involves drawing blood at a health care providers office or a commercial facility and sending the sample to a lab for analysis. The lab tests the sample to estimate how much blood the kidneys filter each minute, called the estimated glomerular filtration rate, or eGFR. The test results help the health care provider determine the amount of kidney damage. Health care providers may also order other blood tests to help determine the underlying disease that may be causing childhood nephrotic syndrome.\n                \nUltrasound of the Kidney\n                \nUltrasound uses a device, called a transducer, that bounces safe, painless sound waves off organs to create an image of their structure. A specially trained technician performs the procedure in a health care providers office, an outpatient center, or a hospital. A radiologista doctor who specializes in medical imaginginterprets the images to see if the kidneys look normal; a child does not need anesthesia.\n                \nKidney Biopsy\n                \nBiopsy is a procedure that involves taking a small piece of kidney tissue for examination with a microscope. A health care provider performs the biopsy in an outpatient center or a hospital. The health care provider will give the child light sedation and local anesthetic; however, in some cases, the child will require general anesthesia. A pathologista doctor who specializes in diagnosing diseasesexamines the tissue in a lab. The test can help diagnose childhood nephrotic syndrome.\n                \nWhen the health care provider suspects a child has minimal change disease, he or she often starts treatment with medications without performing a biopsy. If the medication is effective, the child does not need a biopsy. In most cases, a health care provider does not perform a biopsy on children younger than age 12 unless he or she thinks that another disease is the cause.",

Therefore, it's crucial to consult with a pediatric nephrologist who can provide the most appropriate treatment plan.",
        "original_answer": "Health care providers will decide how to treat childhood nephrotic syndrome based on the type:\n                \n- primary childhood nephrotic syndrome: medications  - secondary childhood nephrotic syndrome: treat the underlying illness or disease  - congenital nephrotic syndrome: medications, surgery to remove one or both kidneys, and transplantation\n                \nPrimary Childhood Nephrotic Syndrome\n                \nHealth care providers treat idiopathic childhood nephrotic syndrome with several types of medications that control the immune system, remove extra fluid, and lower blood pressure.\n                \n- Control the immune system. Corticosteroids are a group of medications that reduce the activity of the immune system, decrease the amount of albumin lost in the urine, and decrease swelling. Health care providers commonly use prednisone or a related corticosteroid to treat idiopathic childhood nephrotic syndrome. About 90 percent of children achieve remission with daily corticosteroids for 6 weeks and then a slightly smaller dose every other day for 6 weeks.2 Remission is a period when the child is symptom-free.  Many children relapse after initial therapy, and health care providers treat them with a shorter course of corticosteroids until the disease goes into remission again. Children may have multiple relapses; however, they most often recover without long-term kidney damage.  When a child has frequent relapses or does not respond to treatment, a health care provider may prescribe other medications that reduce the activity of the immune system. These medications prevent the body from making antibodies that can damage kidney tissues. They include      - cyclophosphamide    - mycophenolate (CellCept, Myfortic)    - cyclosporine    - tacrolimus (Hecoria, Prograf)   A health care provider may use these other immune system medications with corticosteroids or in place of corticosteroids.  - Remove extra fluid. A health care provider may prescribe a diuretic, a medication that helps the kidneys remove extra fluid from the blood. Removing the extra fluid can often help to lower blood pressure.  - Lower blood pressure. Some children with childhood nephrotic syndrome develop high blood pressure and may need to take additional medications to lower their blood pressure. Two types of blood pressure-lowering medications, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers, have the additional benefit of slowing the progression of kidney disease. Many children with nephrotic syndrome require two or more medications to control their blood pressure.\n                \nSecondary Childhood Nephrotic Syndrome\n                \nHealth care providers treat secondary childhood nephrotic syndrome by treating the underlying cause of the primary illness. For example, a health care provider may treat children by\n                \n- prescribing antibiotics for an infection  - adjusting medications to treat lupus, HIV, or diabetes  - changing or stopping medications that are known to cause secondary childhood nephrotic syndrome\n                \nWhile treating the underlying cause, the health care provider will also treat the child to improve or restore kidney function with the same medications used to treat primary childhood nephrotic syndrome.\n                \nCaretakers should make sure that children take all prescribed medications and follow the treatment plan recommended by their health care provider.\n                \nMore information about specific treatments for secondary childhood nephrotic syndrome is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Glomerular Diseases.\n                \nCongenital Nephrotic Syndrome\n                \nResearchers have found that medications are not effective in treating congenital nephrotic syndrome, and that most children will need a kidney transplant by the time they are 2 or 3 years old. A kidney transplant is surgery to place a healthy kidney from someone who has just died or a living donor, most often a family member, into a persons body to take over the job of the failing kidney. To keep the child healthy until the transplant, the health care provider may recommend the following:\n                \n- albumin injections to make up for the albumin lost in urine  - diuretics to help remove extra fluid that causes swelling  - antibiotics to treat the first signs of infection  - growth hormones to promote growth and help bones mature  - removal of one or both kidneys to decrease the loss of albumin in the urine  - dialysis to artificially filter wastes from the blood if the kidneys fail\n                \nMore information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Treatment Methods for Kidney Failure in Children.",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Intestinal pseudo-obstruction is a condition where the intestines do not work properly to move food and waste products through the digestive system. It can cause symptoms similar to a mechanical obstruction, such as abdominal pain, bloating, and vomiting, but there is no physical blockage in the intestines. Instead, the muscles and nerves of the intestines are not functioning correctly, causing the intestines to become paralyzed or have weakened contractions. This can lead to a buildup of food, fluids, and gas in the intestines, which can cause discomfort, pain, and other complications. It can be caused by a variety of factors, including certain medications, medical conditions, and surgery. Treatment typically involves managing symptoms and addressing any underlying causes.",
        "original_answer": "Intestinal pseudo-obstruction is a rare condition with symptoms that resemble those caused by a blockage, or obstruction, of the intestines, also called the bowel. However, when a health care provider examines the intestines, no blockage exists. Instead, the symptoms are due to nerve or muscle problems that affect the movement of food, fluid, and air through the intestines.\n                \nThe intestines are part of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and include the small intestine and the large intestine. The small intestine is the organ where most digestion occurs. The small intestine measures about 20 feet and includes the\n                \n- duodenum, the first part of the small intestine  - jejunum, the middle section of the small intestine  - ileum, the lower end of the small intestine\n                \nThe large intestine absorbs water from stool and changes it from a liquid to a solid form, which passes out of the body during a bowel movement. The large intestine measures about 5 feet and includes the\n                \n- cecum, the first part of the large intestine, which is connected to the ileum  - colon, the part of the large intestine extending from the cecum to the rectum  - rectum, the lower end of the large intestine leading to the anus",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Intestinal pseudo-obstruction is caused by various factors that affect the normal functioning of the intestines without any physical blockage. These factors may include:\n\n1. Nerve or muscle disorders: Conditions such as multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, or muscular dystrophy can affect the nerves and muscles responsible for intestinal movement.\n2. Infections: Bacterial or viral infections can cause inflammation in the intestines, leading to pseudo-obstruction.\n3. Medications: Certain medications, such as narcotics, antidepressants, and antipsychotics, can slow intestinal movement and cause pseudo-obstruction.\n4. Surgery: Previous abdominal or pelvic surgery can lead to scarring or injury to the nerves and muscles, resulting in pseudo-obstruction.\n5. Radiation therapy: Radiation therapy for cancer treatment can damage the intestinal nerves and muscles, causing pseudo-obstruction.\n6. Heredity: In some cases, intestinal pseudo-obstruction can be inherited due to genetic mutations affecting the intestinal nerves and muscles.\n7. Other medical conditions: Conditions such as hypothyroidism, amyloidosis, and scleroderma can also contribute to the development of intestinal pseudo-obstruction.",
        "original_answer": "Problems with nerves, muscles, or interstitial cells of Cajal cause intestinal pseudo-obstruction. Interstitial cells of Cajal are called pacemaker cells because they set the pace of intestinal contractions. These cells convey messages from nerves to muscles.\n                \nProblems with nerves, muscles, or interstitial cells of Cajal prevent normal contractions of the intestines and cause problems with the movement of food, fluid, and air through the intestines.\n                \nPrimary or idiopathic intestinal pseudo-obstruction is intestinal pseudo-obstruction that occurs by itself. In some people with primary intestinal pseudo-obstruction, mutations, or changes, in genestraits passed from parent to childcause the condition. However, health care providers do not typically order genetic testing for an intestinal pseudo-obstruction, as they dont commonly recognize gene mutations as a cause.\n                \nSome people have duplications or deletions of genetic material in the FLNA gene. Researchers believe that these genetic changes may impair the function of a protein, causing problems with the nerve cells in the intestines.1 As a result, the nerves cannot work with the intestinal muscles to produce normal contractions that move food, fluid, and air through the digestive tract. Also, these genetic changes may account for some of the other signs and symptoms that can occur with intestinal pseudo-obstruction, such as bladder symptoms and muscle weakness.\n                \nA condition called mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalopathy may also cause primary intestinal pseudo-obstruction. In people with this condition, mitochondriastructures in cells that produce energydo not function normally. Mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalopathy can also cause other symptoms, such as problems with nerves in the limbs and changes in the brain.\n                \nSecondary intestinal pseudo-obstruction develops as a complication of another medical condition. Causes of secondary intestinal pseudo-obstruction include\n                \n- abdominal or pelvic surgery  - diseases that affect muscles and nerves, such as lupus erythematosus, scleroderma, and Parkinsons disease  - infections  - medications, such as opiates and antidepressants, that affect muscles and nerves  - radiation to the abdomen  - certain cancers, including lung cancer",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Intestinal pseudo-obstruction is typically diagnosed through a combination of medical history, physical examination, and imaging tests such as X-rays or CT scans. These tests can help to visualize the intestines and determine if there is a blockage or obstruction. Other diagnostic tests, such as a manometry or a gastric emptying study, may also be used to evaluate intestinal motility and function. In some cases, a biopsy may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and determine the underlying cause of the pseudo-obstruction. It is important to consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment.",
        "original_answer": "To diagnose intestinal pseudo-obstruction, a health care provider may suggest the person consult a gastroenterologista doctor who specializes in digestive diseases. A health care provider will perform a physical exam; take a complete medical history, imaging studies, and a biopsy; and perform blood tests. A health care provider may order other tests to confirm the diagnosis. The health care provider also will look for the cause of the condition, such as an underlying illness.\n                \nIntestinal pseudo-obstruction can be difficult to diagnose, especially primary intestinal pseudo-obstruction. As a result, a correct diagnosis may take a long time.\n                \nPhysical Exam\n                \nA physical exam is one of the first things a health care provider may do to help diagnose intestinal pseudo-obstruction. During a physical exam, a health care provider usually\n                \n- examines a persons body  - uses a stethoscope to listen to bodily sounds  - taps on specific areas of the persons body\n                \nMedical History\n                \nThe health care provider will ask a person to provide a medical and family history to help diagnose intestinal pseudo-obstruction.\n                \nImaging Studies\n                \nA health care provider may order the following imaging studies:\n                \n- Abdominal x ray. An x ray is a picture recorded on film or a computer that a technician takes using low-level radiation. The amount of radiation used is small. An x-ray technician takes the x ray at a hospital or an outpatient center, and a radiologista doctor who specializes in medical imaginginterprets the images. A person does not need anesthesia. The person will lie on a table or stand during the x ray. The technician positions the x-ray machine over the abdominal area. The person will hold his or her breath as the technician takes the picture so that the picture will not be blurry. The technician may ask the person to change position for additional pictures. An x ray of the abdominal area will show whether symptoms are due to an intestinal blockage.  - Upper GI series. A health care provider may order an upper GI series to look at the small intestine. An x-ray technician performs the test at a hospital or an outpatient center, and a radiologist interprets the images; the health care provider may give infants and children anesthesia. A person should not eat or drink for 8 hours before the procedure, if possible. During the procedure, the person will stand or sit in front of an x-ray machine and drink barium, a chalky liquid. Infants lie on a table and the technician will give them barium through a tiny tube placed in the nose that runs into the stomach. Barium coats the lining of the small intestine, making signs of obstruction show up more clearly on x rays.  A person may experience bloating and nausea for a short time after the test. Barium liquid in the GI tract causes stools to be white or light colored for several days or longer in people with intestinal pseudo-obstruction. A health care provider will give the person specific instructions about eating and drinking after the test.  - Lower GI series. A health care provider may order a lower GI series, an x-ray exam to look at the large intestine. An x-ray technician performs the test at a hospital or an outpatient center, and a radiologist interprets the images. A person does not need anesthesia. The health care provider may provide written bowel prep instructions to follow at home before the test. The health care provider may ask the person to follow a clear liquid diet for 1 to 3 days before the procedure. A person may need to use a laxative or an enema before the test. A laxative is medication that loosens stool and increases bowel movements. An enema involves flushing water or laxative into the anus using a special squirt bottle.  For the test, the person will lie on a table while the health care provider inserts a flexible tube into the persons anus. The health care provider will fill the large intestine with barium, making signs of underlying problems show up more clearly on x rays. The test can show problems with the large intestine that are causing the persons symptoms.  Barium liquid in the GI tract causes stools to be white or light colored for several days or longer in people with intestinal pseudo-obstruction. Enemas and repeated bowel movements may cause anal soreness. A health care provider will provide specific instructions about eating and drinking after the test.  - Computerized tomography (CT) scan. CT scans use a combination of x rays and computer technology to create images. An x-ray technician performs the test at a hospital or an outpatient center, and a radiologist interprets the images. For a CT scan, a health care provider may give the person a solution to drink and an injection of a special dye, called contrast medium. CT scans require the person to lie on a table that slides into a tunnel-shaped device where the technician takes the x rays. CT scans can show both the internal and external intestinal wall. The health care provider may give children a sedative to help them fall asleep for the test.  - Upper GI endoscopy. This procedure involves using an endoscopea small, flexible tube with a lightto see the upper GI tract, which includes the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. A gastroenterologist performs the test at a hospital or an outpatient center. The gastroenterologist carefully feeds the endoscope down the esophagus and into the stomach and duodenum. A small camera mounted on the endoscope transmits a video image to a monitor, allowing close examination of the intestinal lining. A health care provider may give a person a liquid anesthetic to gargle or may spray anesthetic on the back of the persons throat. A health care provider will place an intravenous (IV) needle in a vein in the arm to administer sedation. Sedatives help patients stay relaxed and comfortable. This test can show blockages or other conditions in the upper small intestine. A gastroenterologist may obtain a biopsy of the lining of the small intestine during an upper GI endoscopy.\n                \nBiopsy\n                \nA gastroenterologist can obtain a biopsy of the intestinal wall during endoscopy or during surgery, if the person has surgery for intestinal pseudo-obstruction and the cause is unknown. If the health care provider needs to examine the nerves in the intestinal wall, a deeper biopsy, which a gastroenterologist can typically obtain only during surgery, is necessary.\n                \nA biopsy is a procedure that involves taking a piece of the intestinal wall tissue for examination with a microscope. A health care provider performs the biopsy in a hospital and uses light sedation and local anesthetic; the health care provider uses general anesthesia if performing the biopsy during surgery. A pathologista doctor who specializes in diagnosing diseasesexamines the intestinal tissue in a lab. Diagnosing problems in the nerve pathways of the intestinal tissue requires special techniques that are not widely available.\n                \nA health care provider can also use a biopsy obtained during endoscopy to rule out celiac disease. Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder in which people cannot tolerate gluten because it damages the lining of their small intestine and prevents absorption of nutrients. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, rye, and barley and in products such as vitamin and nutrient supplements, lip balms, and certain medications.\n                \nBlood Tests\n                \nA blood test involves drawing blood at a health care providers office or a commercial facility and sending the sample to a lab for analysis. The blood test can show the presence of other diseases or conditions that may be causing a persons symptoms. The blood test also can show levels of essential vitamins and minerals to help detect malnutrition.\n                \nManometry\n                \nManometry is a test that measures muscle pressure and movements in the GI tract, such as how well the smooth muscles of the stomach and small intestine contract and relax. A gastroenterologist performs the test at a hospital or an outpatient center. While the person is under sedation, a health care provider places a thin tube, or manometry tube, into the stomach and moves it down into the small intestine. A gastroenterologist may use an endoscope to place this tube. A health care provider will move the person to a manometry room and connect the manometry tube to a computer. When the person wakes up from sedation, the computer records the pressure inside the intestine while the person is fasting and after the person has eaten a meal. Manometry can confirm the diagnosis of intestinal pseudo-obstruction and show the extent of the condition.\n                \nGastric Emptying Tests\n                \nGastric emptying tests can show if a disorder called gastroparesis is causing a persons symptoms. People with gastroparesis, which literally refers to a paralyzed stomach, have severely delayed gastric emptying, or the delayed movement of food from the stomach to the small intestine. Some patients with intestinal pseudo-obstruction also have gastroparesis.\n                \nTypes of gastric emptying tests include the following:\n                \n- Gastric emptying scintigraphy. This test involves eating a bland mealsuch as eggs or an egg substitutethat contains a small amount of radioactive material. A specially trained technician performs the test in a radiology center or hospital, and a radiologist interprets the results; the person does not need anesthesia. An external camera scans the abdomen to show where the radioactive material is located. The radiologist is then able to measure the rate of gastric emptying at 1, 2, 3, and 4 hours after the meal. Normal values depend on the composition of the meal. With some meals, if more than 10 percent of the meal is still in the stomach at 4 hours, a health care provider confirms the diagnosis of gastroparesis. Obtaining scans for 4 hours after the meal is essential. When the technician only obtains scans 1 to 2 hours after the meal, the results are often unreliable.  - Breath test. With this test, the person eats a meal containing a small amount of nonradioactive material. Then, the health care provider takes breath samples over a period of several hours to measure the amount of nonradioactive material in the exhaled breath. The results allow the health care provider to calculate how fast the stomach is emptying.  - SmartPill. The SmartPill is a small electronic device in capsule form. The SmartPill test is available at specialized outpatient centers. The person swallows the device so that it can move through the entire digestive tract and send information to a cell-phone-sized receiver worn around the persons waist or neck. The recorded information provides details about how quickly food travels through each part of the digestive tract.",

Intravenous fluids: If you are experiencing dehydration due to chronic diarrhea or vomiting, your doctor may administer intravenous fluids to help restore your electrolyte balance.\n\nIt's important to work closely with your healthcare provider to determine the best course of treatment for your specific situation.",
        "original_answer": "A health care provider will treat intestinal pseudo-obstruction with nutritional support, medications, and, in some cases, decompression. Rarely, a person will need surgery. If an illness, a medication, or both cause intestinal pseudo-obstruction, a health care provider will treat the underlying illness, stop the medication, or do both.\n                \nNutritional Support\n                \nPeople with intestinal pseudo-obstruction often need nutritional support to prevent malnutrition and weight loss. Enteral nutrition provides liquid food through a feeding tube inserted through the nose into the stomach or placed directly into the stomach or small intestine. A health care provider inserts the feeding tube, sometimes using x ray or endoscopy for guidance, and teaches the person how to care for the tube after returning home. Enteral nutrition is sufficient for most people with intestinal pseudo-obstruction. In a severe case, a person may need IV feeding, also called parenteral nutrition, which provides liquid food through a tube placed in a vein.\n                \nEnteral nutrition is possible because the intestinal lining is normal in most people with intestinal pseudo-obstruction. Enteral nutrition is preferred over parenteral nutrition because it has a much lower risk of complications.\n                \nMedications\n                \nA health care provider prescribes medications to treat the different symptoms and complications of intestinal pseudo-obstruction, such as\n                \n- antibiotics to treat bacterial infections  - pain medication, which should be used sparingly, if at all, because most pain medications delay intestinal transit  - medication to make intestinal muscles contract  - antinausea medications  - antidiarrheal medications  - laxatives\n                \nDecompression\n                \nA person with acute colonic pseudo-obstruction and a greatly enlarged colon who does not respond to medications may need a procedure, called decompression, to remove gas from the colon. A gastroenterologist can perform the procedure in a hospital or an outpatient center. The gastroenterologist may choose to decompress the colon by using colonoscopy. During colonoscopy, the gastroenterologist inserts a flexible tube into the colon through the anus. A health care provider gives the person a light sedative, and possibly pain medication, to relax. If the person requires long-term decompression, the gastroenterologist also can decompress the colon through a surgical opening in the cecum. In this case, the health care provider gives the person local anesthesia.\n                \nSurgery\n                \nIn severe cases of intestinal pseudo-obstruction, a person may need surgery to remove part of the intestine. However, surgery should be performed rarely, if at all, because intestinal pseudo-obstruction is a generalized disorder that typically affects the entire intestine. Removing part of the intestine cannot cure the disease.\n                \nA surgeona doctor who specializes in surgerywill perform the surgery at a hospital; a person will need general anesthesia. A few highly specialized treatment centers offer small intestine transplantation. A health care provider may recommend small intestine transplantation when all other treatments have failed.",

This type of diabetes usually goes away after the baby is born, but women who have had gestational diabetes are at increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes later in life.",
        "original_answer": "Diabetes is a complex group of diseases with a variety of causes. People with diabetes have high blood glucose, also called high blood sugar or hyperglycemia.\n                \nDiabetes is a disorder of metabolismthe way the body uses digested food for energy. The digestive tract breaks down carbohydratessugars and starches found in many foodsinto glucose, a form of sugar that enters the bloodstream. With the help of the hormone insulin, cells throughout the body absorb glucose and use it for energy. Diabetes develops when the body doesnt make enough insulin or is not able to use insulin effectively, or both.\n                \nInsulin is made in the pancreas, an organ located behind the stomach. The pancreas contains clusters of cells called islets. Beta cells within the islets make insulin and release it into the blood.\n                \nIf beta cells dont produce enough insulin, or the body doesnt respond to the insulin that is present, glucose builds up in the blood instead of being absorbed by cells in the body, leading to prediabetes or diabetes. Prediabetes is a condition in which blood glucose levels or A1C levelswhich reflect average blood glucose levelsare higher than normal but not high enough to be diagnosed as diabetes. In diabetes, the bodys cells are starved of energy despite high blood glucose levels.\n                \nOver time, high blood glucose damages nerves and blood vessels, leading to complications such as heart disease, stroke, kidney disease, blindness, dental disease, and amputations. Other complications of diabetes may include increased susceptibility to other diseases, loss of mobility with aging, depression, and pregnancy problems. No one is certain what starts the processes that cause diabetes, but scientists believe genes and environmental factors interact to cause diabetes in most cases.\n                \nThe two main types of diabetes are type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. A third type, gestational diabetes, develops only during pregnancy. Other types of diabetes are caused by defects in specific genes, diseases of the pancreas, certain drugs or chemicals, infections, and other conditions. Some people show signs of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes.",

        "original_answer": "Type 1 diabetes is caused by a lack of insulin due to the destruction of insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. In type 1 diabetesan autoimmune diseasethe bodys immune system attacks and destroys the beta cells. Normally, the immune system protects the body from infection by identifying and destroying bacteria, viruses, and other potentially harmful foreign substances. But in autoimmune diseases, the immune system attacks the bodys own cells. In type 1 diabetes, beta cell destruction may take place over several years, but symptoms of the disease usually develop over a short period of time.\n                \nType 1 diabetes typically occurs in children and young adults, though it can appear at any age. In the past, type 1 diabetes was called juvenile diabetes or insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.\n                \nLatent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) may be a slowly developing kind of type 1 diabetes. Diagnosis usually occurs after age 30. In LADA, as in type 1 diabetes, the bodys immune system destroys the beta cells. At the time of diagnosis, people with LADA may still produce their own insulin, but eventually most will need insulin shots or an insulin pump to control blood glucose levels.\n                \nGenetic Susceptibility\n                \nHeredity plays an important part in determining who is likely to develop type 1 diabetes. Genes are passed down from biological parent to child. Genes carry instructions for making proteins that are needed for the bodys cells to function. Many genes, as well as interactions among genes, are thought to influence susceptibility to and protection from type 1 diabetes. The key genes may vary in different population groups. Variations in genes that affect more than 1 percent of a population group are called gene variants.\n                \nCertain gene variants that carry instructions for making proteins called human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) on white blood cells are linked to the risk of developing type 1 diabetes. The proteins produced by HLA genes help determine whether the immune system recognizes a cell as part of the body or as foreign material. Some combinations of HLA gene variants predict that a person will be at higher risk for type 1 diabetes, while other combinations are protective or have no effect on risk.\n                \nWhile HLA genes are the major risk genes for type 1 diabetes, many additional risk genes or gene regions have been found. Not only can these genes help identify people at risk for type 1 diabetes, but they also provide important clues to help scientists better understand how the disease develops and identify potential targets for therapy and prevention.\n                \nGenetic testing can show what types of HLA genes a person carries and can reveal other genes linked to diabetes. However, most genetic testing is done in a research setting and is not yet available to individuals. Scientists are studying how the results of genetic testing can be used to improve type 1 diabetes prevention or treatment.\n                \nAutoimmune Destruction of Beta Cells\n                \nIn type 1 diabetes, white blood cells called T cells attack and destroy beta cells. The process begins well before diabetes symptoms appear and continues after diagnosis. Often, type 1 diabetes is not diagnosed until most beta cells have already been destroyed. At this point, a person needs daily insulin treatment to survive. Finding ways to modify or stop this autoimmune process and preserve beta cell function is a major focus of current scientific research.\n                \nRecent research suggests insulin itself may be a key trigger of the immune attack on beta cells. The immune systems of people who are susceptible to developing type 1 diabetes respond to insulin as if it were a foreign substance, or antigen. To combat antigens, the body makes proteins called antibodies. Antibodies to insulin and other proteins produced by beta cells are found in people with type 1 diabetes. Researchers test for these antibodies to help identify people at increased risk of developing the disease. Testing the types and levels of antibodies in the blood can help determine whether a person has type 1 diabetes, LADA, or another type of diabetes.\n                \nEnvironmental Factors\n                \nEnvironmental factors, such as foods, viruses, and toxins, may play a role in the development of type 1 diabetes, but the exact nature of their role has not been determined. Some theories suggest that environmental factors trigger the autoimmune destruction of beta cells in people with a genetic susceptibility to diabetes. Other theories suggest that environmental factors play an ongoing role in diabetes, even after diagnosis.\n                \nViruses and infections. A virus cannot cause diabetes on its own, but people are sometimes diagnosed with type 1 diabetes during or after a viral infection, suggesting a link between the two. Also, the onset of type 1 diabetes occurs more frequently during the winter when viral infections are more common. Viruses possibly associated with type 1 diabetes include coxsackievirus B, cytomegalovirus, adenovirus, rubella, and mumps. Scientists have described several ways these viruses may damage or destroy beta cells or possibly trigger an autoimmune response in susceptible people. For example, anti-islet antibodies have been found in patients with congenital rubella syndrome, and cytomegalovirus has been associated with significant beta cell damage and acute pancreatitisinflammation of the pancreas. Scientists are trying to identify a virus that can cause type 1 diabetes so that a vaccine might be developed to prevent the disease.\n                \nInfant feeding practices. Some studies have suggested that dietary factors may raise or lower the risk of developing type 1 diabetes. For example, breastfed infants and infants receiving vitamin D supplements may have a reduced risk of developing type 1 diabetes, while early exposure to cows milk and cereal proteins may increase risk. More research is needed to clarify how infant nutrition affects the risk for type 1 diabetes.\n                \nRead more in the Centers for Disease Control and Preventions (CDCs) publication  National Diabetes Statistics Report, 2014 at  www.cdc.gov for information about research studies related to type 1 diabetes.",

        "original_answer": "Type 2 diabetesthe most common form of diabetesis caused by a combination of factors, including insulin resistance, a condition in which the bodys muscle, fat, and liver cells do not use insulin effectively. Type 2 diabetes develops when the body can no longer produce enough insulin to compensate for the impaired ability to use insulin. Symptoms of type 2 diabetes may develop gradually and can be subtle; some people with type 2 diabetes remain undiagnosed for years.\n                \nType 2 diabetes develops most often in middle-aged and older people who are also overweight or obese. The disease, once rare in youth, is becoming more common in overweight and obese children and adolescents. Scientists think genetic susceptibility and environmental factors are the most likely triggers of type 2 diabetes.\n                \nGenetic Susceptibility\n                \nGenes play a significant part in susceptibility to type 2 diabetes. Having certain genes or combinations of genes may increase or decrease a persons risk for developing the disease. The role of genes is suggested by the high rate of type 2 diabetes in families and identical twins and wide variations in diabetes prevalence by ethnicity. Type 2 diabetes occurs more frequently in African Americans, Alaska Natives, American Indians, Hispanics/Latinos, and some Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islander Americans than it does in non-Hispanic whites.\n                \nRecent studies have combined genetic data from large numbers of people, accelerating the pace of gene discovery. Though scientists have now identified many gene variants that increase susceptibility to type 2 diabetes, the majority have yet to be discovered. The known genes appear to affect insulin production rather than insulin resistance. Researchers are working to identify additional gene variants and to learn how they interact with one another and with environmental factors to cause diabetes.\n                \nStudies have shown that variants of the TCF7L2 gene increase susceptibility to type 2 diabetes. For people who inherit two copies of the variants, the risk of developing type 2 diabetes is about 80 percent higher than for those who do not carry the gene variant.1 However, even in those with the variant, diet and physical activity leading to weight loss help delay diabetes, according to the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), a major clinical trial involving people at high risk.\n                \nGenes can also increase the risk of diabetes by increasing a persons tendency to become overweight or obese. One theory, known as the thrifty gene hypothesis, suggests certain genes increase the efficiency of metabolism to extract energy from food and store the energy for later use. This survival trait was advantageous for populations whose food supplies were scarce or unpredictable and could help keep people alive during famine. In modern times, however, when high-calorie foods are plentiful, such a trait can promote obesity and type 2 diabetes.\n                \nObesity and Physical Inactivity\n                \nPhysical inactivity and obesity are strongly associated with the development of type 2 diabetes. People who are genetically susceptible to type 2 diabetes are more vulnerable when these risk factors are present.\n                \nAn imbalance between caloric intake and physical activity can lead to obesity, which causes insulin resistance and is common in people with type 2 diabetes. Central obesity, in which a person has excess abdominal fat, is a major risk factor not only for insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes but also for heart and blood vessel disease, also called cardiovascular disease (CVD). This excess belly fat produces hormones and other substances that can cause harmful, chronic effects in the body such as damage to blood vessels.\n                \nThe DPP and other studies show that millions of people can lower their risk for type 2 diabetes by making lifestyle changes and losing weight. The DPP proved that people with prediabetesat high risk of developing type 2 diabetescould sharply lower their risk by losing weight through regular physical activity and a diet low in fat and calories. In 2009, a follow-up study of DPP participantsthe Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study (DPPOS)showed that the benefits of weight loss lasted for at least 10 years after the original study began.2\n                \nRead more about the DPP, funded under National Institutes of Health (NIH) clinical trial number NCT00004992, and the DPPOS, funded under NIH clinical trial number NCT00038727 in  Diabetes Prevention Program.\n                \nInsulin Resistance\n                \nInsulin resistance is a common condition in people who are overweight or obese, have excess abdominal fat, and are not physically active. Muscle, fat, and liver cells stop responding properly to insulin, forcing the pancreas to compensate by producing extra insulin. As long as beta cells are able to produce enough insulin, blood glucose levels stay in the normal range. But when insulin production falters because of beta cell dysfunction, glucose levels rise, leading to prediabetes or diabetes.\n                \nAbnormal Glucose Production by the Liver\n                \nIn some people with diabetes, an abnormal increase in glucose production by the liver also contributes to high blood glucose levels. Normally, the pancreas releases the hormone glucagon when blood glucose and insulin levels are low. Glucagon stimulates the liver to produce glucose and release it into the bloodstream. But when blood glucose and insulin levels are high after a meal, glucagon levels drop, and the liver stores excess glucose for later, when it is needed. For reasons not completely understood, in many people with diabetes, glucagon levels stay higher than needed. High glucagon levels cause the liver to produce unneeded glucose, which contributes to high blood glucose levels. Metformin, the most commonly used drug to treat type 2 diabetes, reduces glucose production by the liver.\n                \nThe Roles of Insulin and Glucagon in Normal Blood Glucose Regulation\n                \nA healthy persons body keeps blood glucose levels in a normal range through several complex mechanisms. Insulin and glucagon, two hormones made in the pancreas, help regulate blood glucose levels:\n                \n- Insulin, made by beta cells, lowers elevated blood glucose levels.  - Glucagon, made by alpha cells, raises low blood glucose levels.\n                \n- Insulin helps muscle, fat, and liver cells absorb glucose from the bloodstream, lowering blood glucose levels.  - Insulin stimulates the liver and muscle tissue to store excess glucose. The stored form of glucose is called glycogen.  - Insulin also lowers blood glucose levels by reducing glucose production in the liver.\n                \n- Glucagon signals the liver and muscle tissue to break down glycogen into glucose, which enters the bloodstream and raises blood glucose levels.  - If the body needs more glucose, glucagon stimulates the liver to make glucose from amino acids.\n                \nMetabolic Syndrome\n                \nMetabolic syndrome, also called insulin resistance syndrome, refers to a group of conditions common in people with insulin resistance, including\n                \n- higher than normal blood glucose levels  - increased waist size due to excess abdominal fat  - high blood pressure  - abnormal levels of cholesterol and triglycerides in the blood\n                \nCell Signaling and Regulation\n                \nCells communicate through a complex network of molecular signaling pathways. For example, on cell surfaces, insulin receptor molecules capture, or bind, insulin molecules circulating in the bloodstream. This interaction between insulin and its receptor prompts the biochemical signals that enable the cells to absorb glucose from the blood and use it for energy.\n                \nProblems in cell signaling systems can set off a chain reaction that leads to diabetes or other diseases. Many studies have focused on how insulin signals cells to communicate and regulate action. Researchers have identified proteins and pathways that transmit the insulin signal and have mapped interactions between insulin and body tissues, including the way insulin helps the liver control blood glucose levels. Researchers have also found that key signals also come from fat cells, which produce substances that cause inflammation and insulin resistance.\n                \nThis work holds the key to combating insulin resistance and diabetes. As scientists learn more about cell signaling systems involved in glucose regulation, they will have more opportunities to develop effective treatments.\n                \nBeta Cell Dysfunction\n                \nScientists think beta cell dysfunction is a key contributor to type 2 diabetes. Beta cell impairment can cause inadequate or abnormal patterns of insulin release. Also, beta cells may be damaged by high blood glucose itself, a condition called glucose toxicity.\n                \nScientists have not determined the causes of beta cell dysfunction in most cases. Single gene defects lead to specific forms of diabetes called maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY). The genes involved regulate insulin production in the beta cells. Although these forms of diabetes are rare, they provide clues as to how beta cell function may be affected by key regulatory factors. Other gene variants are involved in determining the number and function of beta cells. But these variants account for only a small percentage of type 2 diabetes cases. Malnutrition early in life is also being investigated as a cause of beta cell dysfunction. The metabolic environment of the developing fetus may also create a predisposition for diabetes later in life.\n                \nRisk Factors for Type 2 Diabetes\n                \nPeople who develop type 2 diabetes are more likely to have the following characteristics:\n                \n- age 45 or older  - overweight or obese  - physically inactive  - parent or sibling with diabetes  - family background that is African American, Alaska Native, American Indian, Asian American, Hispanic/Latino, or Pacific Islander American  - history of giving birth to a baby weighing more than 9 pounds  - history of gestational diabetes  - high blood pressure140/90 or aboveor being treated for high blood pressure  - high-density lipoprotein (HDL), or good, cholesterol below 35 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL), or a triglyceride level above 250 mg/dL  - polycystic ovary syndrome, also called PCOS  - prediabetesan A1C level of 5.7 to 6.4 percent; a fasting plasma glucose test result of 100125 mg/dL, called impaired fasting glucose; or a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test result of 140199, called impaired glucose tolerance  - acanthosis nigricans, a condition associated with insulin resistance, characterized by a dark, velvety rash around the neck or armpits  - history of CVD\n                \nThe American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends that testing to detect prediabetes and type 2 diabetes be considered in adults who are overweight or obese and have one or more additional risk factors for diabetes. In adults without these risk factors, testing should begin at age 45.",

Excessive weight gain during pregnancy may also increase risk.\n                \nFamily History\n                \nHaving a family history of diabetes is also a risk factor for gestational diabetes, suggesting that genes play a role in its development. Genetics may also explain why the disorder occurs more frequently in African Americans, American Indians, and Hispanics/Latinos. Many gene variants or combinations of variants may increase a womans risk for developing gestational diabetes. Studies have found several gene variants associated with gestational diabetes, but these variants account for only a small fraction of women with gestational diabetes.\n                \nFuture Risk of Type 2 Diabetes\n                \nBecause a womans hormones usually return to normal levels soon after giving birth, gestational diabetes disappears in most women after delivery. However, women who have gestational diabetes are more likely to develop gestational diabetes with future pregnancies and develop type 2 diabetes.3 Women with gestational diabetes should be tested for persistent diabetes 6 to 12 weeks after delivery and at least every 3 years thereafter.\n                \nAlso, exposure to high glucose levels during gestation increases a childs risk for becoming overweight or obese and for developing type 2 diabetes later on. The result may be a cycle of diabetes affecting multiple generations in a family. For both mother and child, maintaining a healthy body weight and being physically active may help prevent type 2 diabetes.",

Risk factors include obesity, physical inactivity, family history, and certain racial or ethnic groups.\n\nOther causes of diabetes include genetic syndromes, injuries to the pancreas, infections, certain medications, and pregnancy (gestational diabetes).",
        "original_answer": "Other types of diabetes have a variety of possible causes.\n                \nGenetic Mutations Affecting Beta Cells, Insulin, and Insulin Action\n                \nSome relatively uncommon forms of diabetes known as monogenic diabetes are caused by mutations, or changes, in a single gene. These mutations are usually inherited, but sometimes the gene mutation occurs spontaneously. Most of these gene mutations cause diabetes by reducing beta cells ability to produce insulin.\n                \nThe most common types of monogenic diabetes are neonatal diabetes mellitus (NDM) and MODY. NDM occurs in the first 6 months of life. MODY is usually found during adolescence or early adulthood but sometimes is not diagnosed until later in life. More information about NDM and MODY is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Monogenic Forms of Diabetes.\n                \nOther rare genetic mutations can cause diabetes by damaging the quality of insulin the body produces or by causing abnormalities in insulin receptors.\n                \nOther Genetic Diseases\n                \nDiabetes occurs in people with Down syndrome, Klinefelter syndrome, and Turner syndrome at higher rates than the general population. Scientists are investigating whether genes that may predispose people to genetic syndromes also predispose them to diabetes.\n                \nThe genetic disorders cystic fibrosis and hemochromatosis are linked to diabetes. Cystic fibrosis produces abnormally thick mucus, which blocks the pancreas. The risk of diabetes increases with age in people with cystic fibrosis. Hemochromatosis causes the body to store too much iron. If the disorder is not treated, iron can build up in and damage the pancreas and other organs.\n                \nDamage to or Removal of the Pancreas\n                \nPancreatitis, cancer, and trauma can all harm the pancreatic beta cells or impair insulin production, thus causing diabetes. If the damaged pancreas is removed, diabetes will occur due to the loss of the beta cells.\n                \nEndocrine Diseases\n                \nEndocrine diseases affect organs that produce hormones. Cushings syndrome and acromegaly are examples of hormonal disorders that can cause prediabetes and diabetes by inducing insulin resistance. Cushings syndrome is marked by excessive production of cortisolsometimes called the stress hormone. Acromegaly occurs when the body produces too much growth hormone. Glucagonoma, a rare tumor of the pancreas, can also cause diabetes. The tumor causes the body to produce too much glucagon. Hyperthyroidism, a disorder that occurs when the thyroid gland produces too much thyroid hormone, can also cause elevated blood glucose levels.\n                \nAutoimmune Disorders\n                \nRare disorders characterized by antibodies that disrupt insulin action can lead to diabetes. This kind of diabetes is often associated with other autoimmune disorders such as lupus erythematosus. Another rare autoimmune disorder called stiff-man syndrome is associated with antibodies that attack the beta cells, similar to type 1 diabetes.\n                \nMedications and Chemical Toxins\n                \nSome medications, such as nicotinic acid and certain types of diuretics, anti-seizure drugs, psychiatric drugs, and drugs to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), can impair beta cells or disrupt insulin action. Pentamidine, a drug prescribed to treat a type of pneumonia, can increase the risk of pancreatitis, beta cell damage, and diabetes. Also, glucocorticoidssteroid hormones that are chemically similar to naturally produced cortisolmay impair insulin action. Glucocorticoids are used to treat inflammatory illnesses such as rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, lupus, and ulcerative colitis.\n                \nMany chemical toxins can damage or destroy beta cells in animals, but only a few have been linked to diabetes in humans. For example, dioxina contaminant of the herbicide Agent Orange, used during the Vietnam Warmay be linked to the development of type 2 diabetes. In 2000, based on a report from the Institute of Medicine, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) added diabetes to the list of conditions for which Vietnam veterans are eligible for disability compensation. Also, a chemical in a rat poison no longer in use has been shown to cause diabetes if ingested. Some studies suggest a high intake of nitrogen-containing chemicals such as nitrates and nitrites might increase the risk of diabetes. Arsenic has also been studied for possible links to diabetes.\n                \nLipodystrophy\n                \nLipodystrophy is a condition in which fat tissue is lost or redistributed in the body.

        "original_answer": "- Diabetes is a complex group of diseases with a variety of causes. Scientists believe genes and environmental factors interact to cause diabetes in most cases.  - People with diabetes have high blood glucose, also called high blood sugar or hyperglycemia. Diabetes develops when the body doesnt make enough insulin or is not able to use insulin effectively, or both.  - Insulin is a hormone made by beta cells in the pancreas. Insulin helps cells throughout the body absorb and use glucose for energy. If the body does not produce enough insulin or cannot use insulin effectively, glucose builds up in the blood instead of being absorbed by cells in the body, and the body is starved of energy.  - Prediabetes is a condition in which blood glucose levels or A1C levels are higher than normal but not high enough to be diagnosed as diabetes. People with prediabetes can substantially reduce their risk of developing diabetes by losing weight and increasing physical activity.  - The two main types of diabetes are type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. Gestational diabetes is a third form of diabetes that develops only during pregnancy.  - Type 1 diabetes is caused by a lack of insulin due to the destruction of insulin-producing beta cells. In type 1 diabetesan autoimmune diseasethe bodys immune system attacks and destroys the beta cells.  - Type 2 diabetesthe most common form of diabetesis caused by a combination of factors, including insulin resistance, a condition in which the bodys muscle, fat, and liver cells do not use insulin effectively. Type 2 diabetes develops when the body can no longer produce enough insulin to compensate for the impaired ability to use insulin.  - Scientists believe gestational diabetes is caused by the hormonal changes and metabolic demands of pregnancy together with genetic and environmental factors. Risk factors for gestational diabetes include being overweight and having a family history of diabetes.  - Monogenic forms of diabetes are relatively uncommon and are caused by mutations in single genes that limit insulin production, quality, or action in the body.  - Other types of diabetes are caused by diseases and injuries that damage the pancreas; certain chemical toxins and medications; infections; and other conditions.",

        "original_answer": "The GI tract is a series of hollow organs joined in a long, twisting tube from the mouth to the anusthe opening where stool leaves the body. The body digests food using the movement of muscles in the GI tract, along with the release of hormones and enzymes. The upper GI tract includes the mouth, esophagus, stomach, duodenum, and small intestine. The esophagus carries food and liquids from the mouth to the stomach. The stomach slowly pumps the food and liquids into the intestine, which then absorbs needed nutrients. Two digestive organs, the liver and the pancreas, produce digestive juices that reach the small intestine through small tubes called ducts.\n                \nThe last part of the GI tractcalled the lower GI tractconsists of the large intestine and anus. The large intestine is about 5 feet long in adults and absorbs water and any remaining nutrients from partially digested food passed from the small intestine. The large intestine then changes waste from liquid to a solid matter called stool. Stool passes from the colon to the rectum. The rectum is located between the last part of the coloncalled the sigmoid colonand the anus. The rectum stores stool prior to a bowel movement.

Early dumping syndrome results from rapid movement of fluid into the intestine following a sudden addition of a large amount of food from the stomach. Late dumping syndrome results from rapid movement of sugar into the intestine, which raises the body's blood glucose level and causes the pancreas to increase its release of the hormone insulin.

        "original_answer": "A health care provider will diagnose dumping syndrome primarily on the basis of symptoms. A scoring system helps differentiate dumping syndrome from other GI problems. The scoring system assigns points to each symptom and the total points result in a score. A person with a score above 7 likely has dumping syndrome.\n                \nThe following tests may confirm dumping syndrome and exclude other conditions with similar symptoms:\n                \n- A modified oral glucose tolerance test checks how well insulin works with tissues to absorb glucose. A health care provider performs the test during an office visit or in a commercial facility and sends the blood samples to a lab for analysis. The person should fasteat or drink nothing except waterfor at least 8 hours before the test. The health care provider will measure blood glucose concentration, hematocritthe amount of red blood cells in the bloodpulse rate, and blood pressure before the test begins. After the initial measurements, the person drinks a glucose solution. The health care provider repeats the initial measurements immediately and at 30-minute intervals for up to 180 minutes. A health care provider often confirms dumping syndrome in people with      - low blood sugar between 120 and 180 minutes after drinking the solution    - an increase in hematocrit of more than 3 percent at 30 minutes    - a rise in pulse rate of more than 10 beats per minute after 30 minutes     - A gastric emptying scintigraphy test involves eating a bland mealsuch as eggs or an egg substitutethat contains a small amount of radioactive material. A specially trained technician performs this test in a radiology center or hospital, and a radiologista doctor who specializes in medical imaginginterprets the results. Anesthesia is not needed. An external camera scans the abdomen to locate the radioactive material. The radiologist measures the rate of gastric emptying at 1, 2, 3, and 4 hours after the meal. The test can help confirm a diagnosis of dumping syndrome.\n                \n- An upper GI endoscopy involves using an endoscopea small, flexible tube with a lightto see the upper GI tract. A gastroenterologista doctor who specializes in digestive diseasesperforms the test at a hospital or an outpatient center. The gastroenterologist carefully feeds the endoscope down the esophagus and into the stomach and duodenum. A small camera mounted on the endoscope transmits a video image to a monitor, allowing close examination of the intestinal lining. A person may receive general anesthesia or a liquid anesthetic that is gargled or sprayed on the back of the throat. If the person receives general anesthesia, a health care provider will place an intravenous (IV) needle in a vein in the arm. The test may show ulcers, swelling of the stomach lining, or cancer.   - An upper GI series examines the small intestine. An x-ray technician performs the test at a hospital or an outpatient center and a radiologist interprets the images. Anesthesia is not needed. No eating or drinking is allowed before the procedure, as directed by the health care staff. During the procedure, the person will stand or sit in front of an x-ray machine and drink barium, a chalky liquid. Barium coats the small intestine, making signs of a blockage or other complications of gastric surgery show up more clearly on x rays.",

        "original_answer": "The first step to minimizing symptoms of dumping syndrome involves changes in eating, diet, and nutrition, and may include\n                \n- eating five or six small meals a day instead of three larger meals  - delaying liquid intake until at least 30 minutes after a meal  - increasing intake of protein, fiber, and complex carbohydratesfound in starchy foods such as oatmeal and rice  - avoiding simple sugars such as table sugar, which can be found in candy, syrup, sodas, and juice beverages  - increasing the thickness of food by adding pectin or guar gumplant extracts used as thickening agents\n                \nSome people find that lying down for 30 minutes after meals also helps reduce symptoms.\n                \nMedication\n                \nA health care provider may prescribe octreotide acetate (Sandostatin) to treat dumping syndrome symptoms. The medication works by slowing gastric emptying and inhibiting the release of insulin and other GI hormones. Octreotide comes in short- and long-acting formulas. The short-acting formula is injected subcutaneouslyunder the skinor intravenouslyinto a veintwo to four times a day. A health care provider may perform the injections or may train the patient or patient's friend or relative to perform the injections. A health care provider injects the long-acting formula into the buttocks muscles once every 4 weeks. Complications of octreotide treatment include increased or decreased blood glucose levels, pain at the injection site, gallstones, and fatty, foul-smelling stools.\n                \nSurgery\n                \nA person may need surgery if dumping syndrome is caused by previous gastric surgery or if the condition is not responsive to other treatments. For most people, the type of surgery depends on the type of gastric surgery performed previously. However, surgery to correct dumping syndrome often has unsuccessful results.",

Intestinal sensitivity: Some children may have a more sensitive digestive system, making them more prone to experiencing symptoms after eating certain foods or when under stress.\n2. Gut motility issues: Problems with muscle contractions in the intestines can lead to irregular bowel movements, either too fast (diarrhea) or too slow (constipation).\n3.

        "original_answer": "The causes of IBS are not well understood. Researchers believe a combination of physical and mental health problems can lead to IBS. The possible causes of IBS in children include the following:\n                \n- Brain-gut signal problems. Signals between the brain and nerves of the small and large intestines, also called the gut, control how the intestines work. Problems with brain-gut signals may cause IBS symptoms, such as changes in bowel habits and pain or discomfort.  - GI motor problems. Normal motility, or movement, may not be present in the colon of a child who has IBS. Slow motility can lead to constipation and fast motility can lead to diarrhea. Spasms, or sudden strong muscle contractions that come and go, can cause abdominal pain. Some children with IBS also experience hyperreactivity, which is an excessive increase in contractions of the bowel in response to stress or eating.  - Hypersensitivity. Children with IBS have greater sensitivity to abdominal pain than children without IBS. Affected children have been found to have different rectal tone and rectal motor response after eating a meal.  - Mental health problems. IBS has been linked to mental health, or psychological, problems such as anxiety and depression in children.  - Bacterial gastroenteritis. Some children who have bacterial gastroenteritisan infection or irritation of the stomach and intestines caused by bacteriadevelop IBS. Research has shown a connection between gastroenteritis and IBS in adults but not in children. But researchers believe postinfectious IBS does occur in children. Researchers do not know why gastroenteritis leads to IBS in some people and not others.  - Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). Normally, few bacteria live in the small intestine. SIBO is an increase in the number of bacteria or a change in the type of bacteria in the small intestine. These bacteria can produce excess gas and may also cause diarrhea and weight loss. Some researchers believe that SIBO may lead to IBS, and some studies have shown antibiotics to be effective in treating IBS. However, the studies were weak and more research is needed to show a link between SIBO and IBS.  - Genetics. Whether IBS has a genetic cause, meaning it runs in families, is unclear. Studies have shown that IBS is more common in people with family members who have a history of GI problems. However, the cause could be environmental or the result of heightened awareness of GI symptoms.",

Here are the general steps:\n\n1. The child should have recurrent abdominal pain or discomfort for at least 1 day a week in the last 2 months.\n2. The pain or discomfort should be associated with two or more of the following: improvement after a bowel movement, onset associated with a change in frequency of stool, or onset associated with a change in form (appearance) of stool.\n3. There should be no evidence of an underlying condition that could explain the symptoms. This may require blood tests, stool tests, or imaging studies.\n\nIt's important to note that IBS can be challenging to diagnose in children, and a healthcare provider may use additional tests or consultations with specialists to ensure an accurate diagnosis. If you suspect your child has IBS, it's best to consult with a healthcare provider for a proper evaluation.",
        "original_answer": "To diagnose IBS, a health care provider will conduct a physical exam and take a complete medical history. The medical history will include questions about the childs symptoms, family members with GI disorders, recent infections, medications, and stressful events related to the onset of symptoms. IBS is diagnosed when the physical exam does not show any cause for the childs symptoms and the child meets all of the following criteria:\n                \n- has had symptoms at least once per week for at least 2 months  - is growing as expected  - is not showing any signs that suggest another cause for the symptoms\n                \nFurther testing is not usually needed, though the health care provider may do a blood test to screen for other problems. Additional diagnostic tests may be needed based on the results of the screening blood test and for children who also have signs such as\n                \n- persistent pain in the upper right or lower right area of the abdomen  - joint pain  - pain that wakes them from sleep  - disease in the tissues around the rectum  - difficulty swallowing  - persistent vomiting  - slowed growth rate  - GI bleeding  - delayed puberty  - diarrhea at night\n                \nFurther diagnostic tests may also be needed for children with a family history of\n                \n- inflammatory bowel diseaselong-lasting disorders that cause irritation and ulcers, or sores, in the GI tract  - celiac diseasean immune disease in which people cannot tolerate gluten, a protein found in wheat, rye, and barley, because it will damage the lining of their small intestine and prevent absorption of nutrients  - peptic ulcer diseasea sore in the lining of the esophagus or stomach\n                \nAdditional diagnostic tests may include a stool test, ultrasound, and flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy.\n                \nStool tests. A stool test is the analysis of a sample of stool. The health care provider will give the childs caretaker a container for catching and storing the childs stool. The sample is returned to the health care provider or a commercial facility and sent to a lab for analysis. The health care provider may also do a rectal exam, sometimes during the physical exam, to check for blood in the stool. Stool tests can show the presence of parasites or blood.\n                \nUltrasound. Ultrasound uses a device, called a transducer, that bounces safe, painless sound waves off organs to create an image of their structure. The procedure is performed in a health care providers office, outpatient center, or hospital by a specially trained technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologista doctor who specializes in medical imaging; anesthesia is not needed. The images can show problems in the GI tract causing pain or other symptoms.\n                \nFlexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy. The tests are similar, but a colonoscopy is used to view the rectum and entire colon, while a flexible sigmoidoscopy is used to view just the rectum and lower colon. These tests are performed at a hospital or outpatient center by a gastroenterologista doctor who specializes in digestive diseases. For both tests, a health care provider will give written bowel prep instructions to follow at home. The child may be asked to follow a clear liquid diet for 1 to 3 days before either test. The night before the test, the child may need to take a laxative. One or more enemas may also be required the night before and about 2 hours before the test.\n                \nIn most cases, light anesthesia, and possibly pain medication, helps the child relax. For either test, the child will lie on a table while the gastroenterologist inserts a flexible tube into the anus. A small camera on the tube sends a video image of the intestinal lining to a computer screen. The test can show signs of problems in the lower GI tract.\n                \nThe gastroenterologist may also perform a biopsy, a procedure that involves taking a piece of intestinal lining for examination with a microscope. The child will not feel the biopsy. A pathologista doctor who specializes in diagnosing diseasesexamines the tissue in a lab.\n                \nCramping or bloating may occur during the first hour after the test. Full recovery is expected by the next day.",

Caregivers should not give children any medications unless told to do so by a health care provider.\n                \n- Fiber supplements. Fiber supplements may be recommended to relieve constipation when increasing dietary fiber is ineffective.  - Laxatives. Constipation can be treated with laxative medications. Laxatives work in different ways, and a health care provider can provide information about which type is best. Caregivers should not give children laxatives unless told to do so by a health care provider. More information about different types of laxatives is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Constipation.  - Antidiarrheals. Loperamide has been found to reduce diarrhea in children with IBS, though it does not reduce pain, bloating, or other symptoms. Loperamide reduces stool frequency and improves stool consistency by slowing the movement of stool through the colon. Medications to treat diarrhea in adults can be dangerous for infants and children and should only be given if told to do so by a health care provider.  - Antispasmodics. Antispasmodics, such as hyoscine, cimetropium, and pinaverium, help to control colon muscle spasms and reduce abdominal pain.  - Antidepressants. Tricyclic antidepressants and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in low doses can help relieve IBS symptoms including abdominal pain. These medications are thought to reduce the perception of pain, improve mood and sleep patterns, and adjust the activity of the GI tract.\n                \nProbiotics\n                \nProbiotics are live microorganisms, usually bacteria, that are similar to microorganisms normally found in the GI tract. Studies have found that probiotics, specifically Bifidobacteria and certain probiotic combinations, improve symptoms of IBS when taken in large enough amounts. But more research is needed. Probiotics can be found in dietary supplements, such as capsules, tablets, and powders, and in some foods, such as yogurt. A health care provider can give information about the right kind and right amount of probiotics to take to improve IBS symptoms. More information about probiotics can be found in the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine fact sheet An Introduction to Probiotics.\n                \nTherapies for Mental Health Problems\n                \nThe following therapies can help improve IBS symptoms due to mental health problems:\n                \n- Talk therapy. Talking with a therapist may reduce stress and improve IBS symptoms. Two types of talk therapy used to treat IBS are cognitive behavioral therapy and psychodynamic, or interpersonal, therapy. Cognitive behavioral therapy focuses on the childs thoughts and actions. Psychodynamic therapy focuses on how emotions affect IBS symptoms. This type of therapy often involves relaxation and stress management techniques.  - Hypnotherapy. In hypnotherapy, the therapist uses hypnosis to help the child relax into a trancelike state. This type of therapy may help the child relax the muscles in the colon.",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) in children can cause discomfort and affect their daily activities. While there is no cure for IBS, there are ways to manage the symptoms:\n\n1. Diet: Encourage your child to eat small, frequent meals throughout the day. Increase fiber intake gradually, and have them avoid foods that trigger symptoms, such as dairy, caffeine, and fatty foods.\n\n2. Hydration: Make sure your child drinks plenty of water to stay hydrated.\n\n3. Regular exercise: Encourage your child to engage in regular physical activity, as it can help relieve symptoms.\n\n4. Stress management: Teach your child relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing, meditation, or yoga, to help manage stress and anxiety, which can worsen IBS symptoms.\n\n5. Over-the-counter medications: Anti-diarrheal or anti-gas medications may help relieve symptoms. Consult your pediatrician before administering any medication.\n\n6. Prescription medications: In some cases, your pediatrician may prescribe medications to help manage IBS symptoms.\n\n7.

        "original_answer": "- Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorder, meaning it is a problem caused by changes in how the GI tract works. Children with a functional GI disorder have frequent symptoms, but the GI tract does not become damaged.  - IBS is not a disease; it is a group of symptoms that occur together.  - The most common symptoms of IBS are abdominal pain or discomfort, often reported as cramping, along with diarrhea, constipation, or both.  - The causes of IBS are not well understood. The possible causes of IBS in children include brain-gut signal problems, GI motor problems, hypersensitivity, mental health problems, bacterial gastroenteritis, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, and genetics.  - To diagnose IBS, a health care provider will conduct a physical exam and take a complete medical history. The medical history will include questions about the childs symptoms, family members with GI disorders, recent infections, medications, and stressful events related to the onset of symptoms. IBS is diagnosed when the physical exam does not show any cause for the childs symptoms and the child meets all of the following criteria:      - has had symptoms at least once per week for at least 2 months    - is growing as expected    - is not showing any signs that suggest another cause for the symptoms    - Though there is no cure for IBS, the symptoms can be treated with a combination of the following:      - changes in eating, diet, and nutrition    - medications    - probiotics    - therapies for mental health problems",

        "original_answer": "Gastroparesis, also called delayed gastric emptying, is a disorder that slows or stops the movement of food from the stomach to the small intestine. Normally, the muscles of the stomach, which are controlled by the vagus nerve, contract to break up food and move it through the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The GI tract is a series of hollow organs joined in a long, twisting tube from the mouth to the anus. The movement of muscles in the GI tract, along with the release of hormones and enzymes, allows for the digestion of food. Gastroparesis can occur when the vagus nerve is damaged by illness or injury and the stomach muscles stop working normally. Food then moves slowly from the stomach to the small intestine or stops moving altogether.",

        "original_answer": "Most people diagnosed with gastroparesis have idiopathic gastroparesis, which means a health care provider cannot identify the cause, even with medical tests. Diabetes is the most common known cause of gastroparesis. People with diabetes have high levels of blood glucose, also called blood sugar. Over time, high blood glucose levels can damage the vagus nerve. Other identifiable causes of gastroparesis include intestinal surgery and nervous system diseases such as Parkinsons disease or multiple sclerosis. For reasons that are still unclear, gastroparesis is more commonly found in women than in men.",

        "original_answer": "Gastroparesis is diagnosed through a physical exam, medical history, blood tests, tests to rule out blockage or structural problems in the GI tract, and gastric emptying tests. Tests may also identify a nutritional disorder or underlying disease. To rule out any blockage or other structural problems, the health care provider may perform one or more of the following tests:\n                \n- Upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy. This procedure involves using an endoscopea small, flexible tube with a lightto see the upper GI tract, which includes the esophagus, stomach, and duodenumthe first part of the small intestine. The test is performed at a hospital or outpatient center by a gastroenterologista doctor who specializes in digestive diseases. The endoscope is carefully fed down the esophagus and into the stomach and duodenum. A small camera mounted on the endoscope transmits a video image to a monitor, allowing close examination of the intestinal lining. A person may receive a liquid anesthetic that is gargled or sprayed on the back of the throat. An intravenous (IV) needle is placed in a vein in the arm if general anesthesia is given. The test may show blockage or large bezoarssolid collections of food, mucus, vegetable fiber, hair, or other material that cannot be digested in the stomachthat are sometimes softened, dissolved, or broken up during an upper GI endoscopy.  - Upper GI series. An upper GI series may be done to look at the small intestine. The test is performed at a hospital or outpatient center by an x-ray technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologista doctor who specializes in medical imaging. Anesthesia is not needed. No eating or drinking is allowed for 8 hours before the procedure, if possible. If the person has diabetes, a health care provider may give different instructions about fasting before the test. During the procedure, the person will stand or sit in front of an x-ray machine and drink barium, a chalky liquid. Barium coats the small intestine, making signs of gastroparesis show up more clearly on x rays. Gastroparesis is likely if the x ray shows food in the stomach after fasting. A person may experience bloating and nausea for a short time after the test. For several days afterward, barium liquid in the GI tract causes stools to be white or light colored. A health care provider will give the person specific instructions about eating and drinking after the test.  - Ultrasound. Ultrasound uses a device, called a transducer, that bounces safe, painless sound waves off organs to create an image of their structure. The procedure is performed in a health care providers office, outpatient center, or hospital by a specially trained technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologist; anesthesia is not needed. The images can show whether gallbladder disease and pancreatitis could be the cause of a persons digestive symptoms, rather than gastroparesis.  - Gastric emptying scintigraphy. The test involves eating a bland mealsuch as eggs or an egg substitutethat contains a small amount of radioactive material. The test is performed in a radiology center or hospital by a specially trained technician and interpreted by a radiologist; anesthesia is not needed. An external camera scans the abdomen to show where the radioactive material is located. The radiologist is then able to measure the rate of gastric emptying at 1, 2, 3, and 4 hours after the meal. If more than 10 percent of the meal is still in the stomach at 4 hours, the diagnosis of gastroparesis is confirmed.  - SmartPill. The SmartPill is a small electronic device in capsule form. The SmartPill test is available at specialized outpatient centers. The images are interpreted by a radiologist. The device is swallowed and moves through the entire digestive tract, sending information to a cell-phone-sized receiver worn around the persons waist or neck. The recorded information provides a detailed record of how quickly food travels through each part of the digestive tract.  - Gastric emptying breath test. With this test, the person eats a special test meal that includes a natural material with a special type of carbon in it. Then, breath samples are taken over a period of several hours to measure the amount of the material in the exhaled breath. The results allow the health care provider to calculate how fast the stomach is emptying.",

Lifestyle changes: Regular exercise, quitting smoking, and managing stress can also help improve symptoms.\n\nRemember, it's important to consult with your healthcare provider for a personalized treatment plan.",
        "original_answer": "Changing eating habits can sometimes help control the severity of gastroparesis symptoms. A health care provider may suggest eating six small meals a day instead of three large ones. If less food enters the stomach each time a person eats, the stomach may not become overly full, allowing it to empty more easily. Chewing food well, drinking noncarbonated liquids with a meal, and walking or sitting for 2 hours after a mealinstead of lying downmay assist with gastric emptying.\n                \nA health care provider may also recommend avoiding high-fat and fibrous foods. Fat naturally slows digestion and some raw vegetables and fruits are more difficult to digest than other foods. Some foods, such as oranges and broccoli, contain fibrous parts that do not digest well. People with gastroparesis should minimize their intake of large portions of these foods because the undigested parts may remain in the stomach too long. Sometimes, the undigested parts form bezoars.\n                \nWhen a person has severe symptoms, a liquid or pured diet may be prescribed. As liquids tend to empty more quickly from the stomach, some people may find a pured diet helps improve symptoms. Pured fresh or cooked fruits and vegetables can be incorporated into shakes and soups. A health care provider may recommend a dietitian to help a person plan meals that minimize symptoms and ensure all nutritional needs are met.\n                \nWhen the most extreme cases of gastroparesis lead to severe nausea, vomiting, and dehydration, urgent care may be required at a medical facility where IV fluids can be given.\n                \n\n                \nMedications\n                \nSeveral prescription medications are available to treat gastroparesis. A combination of medications may be used to find the most effective treatment.\n                \nMetoclopramide (Reglan). This medication stimulates stomach muscle contractions to help with gastric emptying. Metoclopramide also helps reduce nausea and vomiting. The medication is taken 20 to 30 minutes before meals and at bedtime. Possible side effects of metoclopramide include fatigue, sleepiness, and depression. Currently, this is the only medication approved by the FDA for treatment of gastroparesis. However, the FDA has placed a black box warning on this medication because of rare reports of it causing an irreversible neurologic side effect called tardive dyskinesiaa disorder that affects movement.\n                \nErythromycin. This antibiotic, prescribed at low doses, may improve gastric emptying. Like metaclopramide, erythromycin works by increasing the contractions that move food through the stomach. Possible side effects of erythromycin include nausea, vomiting, and abdominal cramps.\n                \nOther medications. Other medications may be used to treat symptoms and problems related to gastroparesis. For example, medications known as antiemetics are used to help control nausea and vomiting.\n                \nBotulinum Toxin\n                \nBotulinum toxin is a nerve blocking agent also known as Botox. After passing an endoscope into the stomach, a health care provider injects the Botox into the pylorus, the opening from the stomach into the duodenum. Botox is supposed to help keep the pylorus open for longer periods of time and improve symptoms of gastroparesis. Although some initial research trials showed modest improvement in gastroparesis symptoms and the rate of gastric emptying following the injections, other studies have failed to show the same degree of effectiveness of the Botox injections.1\n                \nGastric Electrical Stimulation\n                \nThis treatment alternative may be effective for some people whose nausea and vomiting do not improve with dietary changes or medications. A gastric neurostimulator is a surgically implanted battery-operated device that sends mild electrical pulses to the stomach muscles to help control nausea and vomiting. The procedure may be performed at a hospital or outpatient center by a gastroenterologist. General anesthesia may be required. The gastroenterologist makes several tiny incisions in the abdomen and inserts a laparoscopea thin tube with a tiny video camera attached. The camera sends a magnified image from inside the stomach to a video monitor, giving the gastroenterologist a close-up view of the tissues. Once implanted, the settings on the battery-operated device can be adjusted to determine the settings that best control symptoms.\n                \nJejunostomy\n                \nIf medications and dietary changes dont work, and the person is losing weight or requires frequent hospitalization for dehydration, a health care provider may recommend surgically placing a feeding tube through the abdominal wall directly into a part of the small intestine called the jejunum. The surgical procedure is known as a jejunostomy. The procedure is performed by a surgeon at a hospital or outpatient center. Anesthesia is needed. The feeding tube bypasses the stomach and delivers a special liquid food with nutrients directly into the jejunum. The jejunostomy is used only when gastroparesis is extremely severe.\n                \nParenteral Nutrition\n                \nWhen gastroparesis is so severe that dietary measures and other treatments are not helping, a health care provider may recommend parenteral nutritionan IV liquid food mixture supplied through a special tube in the chest. The procedure is performed by a surgeon at a hospital or outpatient center; anesthesia is needed. The surgeon inserts a thin, flexible tube called a catheter into a chest vein, with the catheter opening outside the skin. A bag containing liquid nutrients is attached to the catheter, and the nutrients are transported through the catheter into the chest vein and into the bloodstream. This approach is a less preferable alternative to a jejunostomy and is usually a temporary treatment to get through a difficult period of gastroparesis.",

        "original_answer": "An elevated blood glucose level directly interferes with normal stomach emptying, so good blood glucose control in people with diabetes is important. However, gastroparesis can make blood glucose control difficult. When food that has been delayed in the stomach finally enters the small intestine and is absorbed, blood glucose levels rise. Gastric emptying is unpredictable with gastroparesis, causing a persons blood glucose levels to be erratic and difficult to control.\n                \nThe primary treatment goals for gastroparesis related to diabetes are to improve gastric emptying and regain control of blood glucose levels. In addition to the dietary changes and treatments already described, a health care provider will likely adjust the persons insulin regimen.\n                \nTo better control blood glucose, people with diabetes and gastroparesis may need to\n                \n- take insulin more often or change the type of insulin they take  - take insulin after meals, instead of before  - check blood glucose levels frequently after eating and administer insulin when necessary\n                \nA health care provider will give specific instructions for taking insulin based on the individuals needs and the severity of gastroparesis.\n                \nIn some cases, the dietitian may suggest eating several liquid or pured meals a day until gastroparesis symptoms improve and blood glucose levels are more stable.",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "I'm here to provide general advice and information, but I can't provide specific medical advice. Gastroparesis is a condition where the stomach has difficulty emptying food. Here are some general tips that might help:\n\n1. Eat smaller, more frequent meals instead of three large meals.\n2. Choose foods that are low in fat and fiber, as they are easier to digest.\n3. Avoid carbonated drinks, alcohol, and smoking.\n4. Stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water, but avoid drinking during meals.\n5. Medications may be prescribed to help with symptoms, so it's important to discuss this with your doctor.\n6. If symptoms are severe, a feeding tube or intravenous feeding may be necessary.\n\nRemember, it's crucial to consult with your healthcare provider for a personalized treatment plan.",
        "original_answer": "- Gastroparesis, also called delayed gastric emptying, is a disorder that slows or stops the movement of food from the stomach to the small intestine.  - Gastroparesis can occur when the vagus nerve is damaged by illness or injury and the stomach muscles stop working normally. Food then moves slowly from the stomach to the small intestine or stops moving altogether.  - Most people diagnosed with gastroparesis have idiopathic gastroparesis, which means a health care provider cannot identify the cause, even with medical tests.  - Diabetes is the most common known cause of gastroparesis. People with diabetes have high levels of blood glucose, also called blood sugar. Over time, high blood glucose levels can damage the vagus nerve.  - The most common symptoms of gastroparesis are nausea, a feeling of fullness after eating only a small amount of food, and vomiting undigested food sometimes several hours after a meal. Other common symptoms include gastroesophageal reflux (GER), pain in the stomach area, abdominal bloating, and lack of appetite.  - Gastroparesis is diagnosed through a physical exam, medical history, blood tests, tests to rule out blockage or structural problems in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and gastric emptying tests.  - Changing eating habits can sometimes help control the severity of gastroparesis symptoms. A health care provider may suggest eating six small meals a day instead of three large ones. When a person has severe symptoms, a liquid or pured diet may be prescribed.  - Treatment of gastroparesis may include medications, botulinum toxin, gastric electrical stimulation, jejunostomy, and parenteral nutrition.  - For people with gastroparesis and diabetes, a health care provider will likely adjust the persons insulin regimen.",

Certain diseases such as diabetes, multiple sclerosis, or stroke that affect the nerves.\n4. Inflammatory bowel diseases like Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis.\n5. Rectal cancer or radiation therapy for cancer.\n6. Aging, as muscles and nerves naturally weaken over time.\n\nIf you're experiencing fecal incontinence, it's important to consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan.",
        "original_answer": "Fecal incontinence has many causes, including\n                \n- diarrhea  - constipation  - muscle damage or weakness  - nerve damage  - loss of stretch in the rectum  - childbirth by vaginal delivery  - hemorrhoids and rectal prolapse  - rectocele  - inactivity\n                \nDiarrhea\n                \nDiarrhea can cause fecal incontinence. Loose stools fill the rectum quickly and are more difficult to hold than solid stools. Diarrhea increases the chance of not reaching a bathroom in time.\n                \nConstipation\n                \nConstipation can lead to large, hard stools that stretch the rectum and cause the internal sphincter muscles to relax by reflex. Watery stool builds up behind the hard stool and may leak out around the hard stool, leading to fecal incontinence.\n                \nThe type of constipation that is most likely to lead to fecal incontinence occurs when people are unable to relax their external sphincter and pelvic floor muscles when straining to have a bowel movement, often mistakenly squeezing these muscles instead of relaxing them. This squeezing makes it difficult to pass stool and may lead to a large amount of stool in the rectum. This type of constipation, called dyssynergic defecation or disordered defecation, is a result of faulty learning. For example, children or adults who have pain when having a bowel movement may unconsciously learn to squeeze their muscles to delay the bowel movement and avoid pain.\n                \nMuscle Damage or Weakness\n                \nInjury to one or both of the sphincter muscles can cause fecal incontinence. If these muscles, called the external and internal anal sphincter muscles, are damaged or weakened, they may not be strong enough to keep the anus closed and prevent stool from leaking.\n                \nTrauma, childbirth injuries, cancer surgery, and hemorrhoid surgery are possible causes of injury to the sphincters. Hemorrhoids are swollen blood vessels in and around the anus and lower rectum.\n                \nNerve Damage\n                \nThe anal sphincter muscles wont open and close properly if the nerves that control them are damaged. Likewise, if the nerves that sense stool in the rectum are damaged, a person may not feel the urge to go to the bathroom. Both types of nerve damage can lead to fecal incontinence. Possible sources of nerve damage are childbirth; a long-term habit of straining to pass stool; spinal cord injury; and diseases, such as diabetes and multiple sclerosis, that affect the nerves that go to the sphincter muscles and rectum. Brain injuries from stroke, head trauma, or certain diseases can also cause fecal incontinence.\n                \nLoss of Stretch in the Rectum\n                \nNormally, the rectum stretches to hold stool until a person has a bowel movement. Rectal surgery, radiation treatment, and inflammatory bowel diseaseschronic disorders that cause irritation and sores on the lining of the digestive systemcan cause the rectal walls to become stiff. The rectum then cant stretch as much to hold stool, increasing the risk of fecal incontinence.\n                \nChildbirth by Vaginal Delivery\n                \nChildbirth sometimes causes injuries to muscles and nerves in the pelvic floor. The risk is greater if forceps are used to help deliver the baby or if an episiotomya cut in the vaginal area to prevent the babys head from tearing the vagina during birthis performed. Fecal incontinence related to childbirth can appear soon after delivery or many years later.\n                \nHemorrhoids and Rectal Prolapse\n                \nExternal hemorrhoids, which develop under the skin around the anus, can prevent the anal sphincter muscles from closing completely. Rectal prolapse, a condition that causes the rectum to drop down through the anus, can also prevent the anal sphincter muscles from closing well enough to prevent leakage. Small amounts of mucus or liquid stool can then leak through the anus.\n                \nRectocele\n                \nRectocele is a condition that causes the rectum to protrude through the vagina. Rectocele can happen when the thin layer of muscles separating the rectum from the vagina becomes weak. For women with rectocele, straining to have a bowel movement may be less effective because rectocele reduces the amount of downward force through the anus. The result may be retention of stool in the rectum. More research is needed to be sure rectocele increases the risk of fecal incontinence.\n                \nInactivity\n                \nPeople who are inactive, especially those who spend many hours a day sitting or lying down, have an increased risk of retaining a large amount of stool in the rectum. Liquid stool can then leak around the more solid stool. Frail, older adults are most likely to develop constipation-related fecal incontinence for this reason.",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Fecal incontinence is typically diagnosed through a combination of methods:\n\n1. Medical History: The doctor will ask about symptoms, bowel movement patterns, and any underlying health conditions.\n\n2. Physical Examination: This may include a digital rectal exam to assess muscle tone and sphincter function.\n\n3. Diagnostic Tests: These can include anorectal ultrasound, manometry (to measure sphincter muscle pressure), or proctography (to evaluate rectal function).\n\n4. Stool Tests: These can help identify any underlying infections or gastrointestinal disorders.\n\n5. Imaging Tests: These can include MRI or CT scans to provide detailed images of the rectum and anus.\n\nRemember, it's important to consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis.",
        "original_answer": "Health care providers diagnose fecal incontinence based on a persons medical history, physical exam, and medical test results. In addition to a general medical history, the health care provider may ask the following questions:\n                \n- When did fecal incontinence start?  - How often does fecal incontinence occur?  - How much stool leaks? Does the stool just streak the underwear? Does just a little bit of solid or liquid stool leak out or does complete loss of bowel control occur?  - Does fecal incontinence involve a strong urge to have a bowel movement or does it happen without warning?  - For people with hemorrhoids, do hemorrhoids bulge through the anus? Do the hemorrhoids pull back in by themselves, or do they have to be pushed in with a finger?  - How does fecal incontinence affect daily life?  - Is fecal incontinence worse after eating? Do certain foods seem to make fecal incontinence worse?  - Can passing gas be controlled?\n                \nPeople may want to keep a stool diary for several weeks before their appointment so they can answer these questions. A stool diary is a chart for recording daily bowel movement details. A sample stool diary is available on the Bowel Control Awareness Campaign website at www.bowelcontrol.nih.gov.\n                \nThe person may be referred to a doctor who specializes in problems of the digestive system, such as a gastroenterologist, proctologist, or colorectal surgeon, or a doctor who specializes in problems of the urinary and reproductive systems, such as a urologist or urogynecologist. The specialist will perform a physical exam and may suggest one or more of the following tests:\n                \n- anal manometry  - anal ultrasound  - magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)  - defecography  - flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy  - anal electromyography (EMG)\n                \nAnal manometry. Anal manometry uses pressure sensors and a balloon that can be inflated in the rectum to check the sensitivity and function of the rectum. Anal manometry also checks the tightness of the anal sphincter muscles around the anus. To prepare for this test, the person should use an enema and not eat anything 2 hours before the test. An enema involves flushing water or a laxative into the anus using a special squirt bottle. A laxative is medication that loosens stool and increases bowel movements. For this test, a thin tube with a balloon on its tip and pressure sensors below the balloon is inserted into the anus until the balloon is in the rectum and pressure sensors are located in the anal canal. The tube is slowly pulled back through the sphincter muscle to measure muscle tone and contractions. No anesthesia is needed for this test, which takes about 30 minutes.\n                \nAnal ultrasound. Ultrasound uses a device, called a transducer, that bounces safe, painless sound waves off organs to create an image of their structure. An anal ultrasound is specific to the anus and rectum. The procedure is performed in a health care providers office, outpatient center, or hospital by a specially trained technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologista doctor who specializes in medical imaging. Anesthesia is not needed. The images can show the structure of the anal sphincter muscles.\n                \nMRI. MRI machines use radio waves and magnets to produce detailed pictures of the bodys internal organs and soft tissues without using x rays. The procedure is performed in an outpatient center or hospital by a specially trained technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologist. Anesthesia is not needed, though people with a fear of confined spaces may be given medication to help them relax. An MRI may include the injection of special dye, called contrast medium. With most MRI machines, the person lies on a table that slides into a tunnel-shaped device that may be open ended or closed at one end; some newer machines are designed to allow the person to lie in a more open space. MRIs can show problems with the anal sphincter muscles. MRI is an alternative to anal ultrasound that may provide more detailed information, especially about the external anal sphincter.\n                \nDefecography. This x ray of the area around the anus and rectum shows how well the person can hold and evacuate stool. The test also identifies structural changes in the rectum and anus such as rectocele and rectal prolapse. To prepare for the test, the person uses two enemas and does not eat anything 2 hours prior to the test. During the test, the health care provider fills the rectum with a soft paste that shows up on x rays and is the same consistency as stool. The person sits on a toilet inside an x-ray machine. The person is first asked to pull in and squeeze the sphincter muscles to prevent leakage and then to strain as if having a bowel movement. The radiologist studies the x rays to identify problems with the rectum, anus, and pelvic floor muscles.\n                \nFlexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy. These tests are used to help diagnose problems causing fecal incontinence. The tests are similar, but colonoscopy is used to view the rectum and entire colon, while flexible sigmoidoscopy is used to view just the rectum and lower colon. These tests are performed at a hospital or outpatient center by a gastroenterologist. For both tests, a health care provider will provide written bowel prep instructions to follow at home. The person may be asked to follow a clear liquid diet for 1 to 3 days before either test. A laxative may be required the night before the test. One or more enemas may be required the night before and about 2 hours before the test.\n                \nIn most cases, people will be given light anesthesia, and possibly pain medication, to help them relax during flexible sigmoidoscopy. Anesthesia is used for colonoscopy. For either test, the person will lie on a table while the gastroenterologist inserts a flexible tube into the anus. A small camera on the tube sends a video image of the intestinal lining to a computer screen. The test can show problems in the lower GI tract that may be causing the bowel control problem. The gastroenterologist may also perform a biopsy, a procedure that involves taking a piece of tissue from the bowel lining for examination with a microscope.\n                \nThe person will not feel the biopsy. A pathologista doctor who specializes in diagnosing diseasesexamines the tissue in a lab to confirm the diagnosis.\n                \nCramping or bloating may occur during the first hour after these tests. Driving is not permitted for 24 hours after flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy to allow the anesthesia time to wear off. Before the appointment, a person should make plans for a ride home. Full recovery is expected by the next day and the person is able to go back to a normal diet.\n                \nAnal EMG. Anal EMG checks the health of the pelvic floor muscles and the nerves that control the muscles. The health care provider inserts a very thin needle electrode through the skin into the muscle. The electrode on the needle picks up the electrical activity given off by the muscles and shows it as images on a monitor or sounds through a speaker. An alternative type of anal EMG uses stainless steel plates attached to the sides of a plastic plug instead of a needle. The plug is inserted into the anal canal to measure the electrical activity of the external anal sphincter and other pelvic floor muscles. The average amount of electrical activity when the person relaxes quietly, squeezes to prevent a bowel movement, and strains to have a bowel movement shows whether there is damage to the nerves that control the external sphincter and pelvic floor muscles.",

        "original_answer": "Dietary changes that may improve fecal incontinence include\n                \n- Eating the right amount of fiber. Fiber can help with diarrhea and constipation. Fiber is found in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and beans. Fiber supplements sold in a pharmacy or in a health food store are another common source of fiber to treat fecal incontinence. The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics recommends consuming 20 to 35 grams of fiber a day for adults and age plus five grams for children. A 7-year-old child, for example, should get 7 plus five, or 12, grams of fiber a day. American adults consume only 15 grams a day on average.2 Fiber should be added to the diet slowly to avoid bloating.  - Getting plenty to drink. Drinking eight 8-ounce glasses of liquid a day may help prevent constipation. Water is a good choice. Drinks with caffeine, alcohol, milk, or carbonation should be avoided if they trigger diarrhea.\n                \nKeeping a Food Diary   A food diary can help identify foods that cause diarrhea and increase the risk of fecal incontinence. A food diary should list foods eaten, portion size, and when fecal incontinence occurs. After a few days, the diary may show a link between certain foods and fecal incontinence. Eating less of foods linked to fecal incontinence may improve symptoms. A food diary can also be helpful to a health care provider treating a person with fecal incontinence.   Common foods and drinks linked to fecal incontinence include   - dairy products such as milk, cheese, and ice cream   - drinks and foods containing caffeine   - cured or smoked meat such as sausage, ham, and turkey   - spicy foods   - alcoholic beverages   - fruits such as apples, peaches, and pears   - fatty and greasy foods   - sweeteners in diet drinks and sugarless gum and candy, including sorbitol, xylitol, mannitol, and fructose\n                \n\n                \nExamples of Foods That Have Fiber        Beans, cereals, and breads    Fiber         cup of beans (navy, pinto, kidney, etc.), cooked    6.29.6 grams         cup of shredded wheat, ready-to-eat cereal    2.73.8 grams         cup of 100% bran, ready-to-eat cereal    9.1 grams        1 small oat bran muffin    3.0 grams        1 whole-wheat English muffin    4.4 grams        Fruits        1 small apple, with skin    3.6 grams        1 medium pear, with skin    5.5 grams         cup of raspberries    4.0 grams         cup of stewed prunes    3.8 grams        Vegetables         cup of winter squash, cooked    2.9 grams         1 medium sweet potato, baked in skin    3.8 grams         cup of green peas, cooked    3.54.4 grams        1 small potato, baked, with skin    3.0 grams         cup of mixed vegetables, cooked    4.0 grams         cup of broccoli, cooked    2.62.8 grams          cup of greens (spinach, collards, turnip greens), cooked    2.53.5 grams\n                \n\n                \nMedications\n                \nIf diarrhea is causing fecal incontinence, medication may help. Health care providers sometimes recommend using bulk laxatives, such as Citrucel and Metamucil, to develop more solid stools that are easier to control. Antidiarrheal medications such as loperamide or diphenoxylate may be recommended to slow down the bowels and help control the problem.\n                \nBowel Training\n                \nDeveloping a regular bowel movement pattern can improve fecal incontinence, especially fecal incontinence due to constipation. Bowel training involves trying to have bowel movements at specific times of the day, such as after every meal. Over time, the body becomes used to a regular bowel movement pattern, thus reducing constipation and related fecal incontinence. Persistence is key to successful bowel training. Achieving a regular bowel control pattern can take weeks to months.\n                \nPelvic Floor Exercises and Biofeedback\n                \nExercises that strengthen the pelvic floor muscles may improve bowel control. Pelvic floor exercises involve squeezing and relaxing pelvic floor muscles 50 to 100 times a day. A health care provider can help with proper technique. Biofeedback therapy may also help a person perform the exercises properly. This therapy also improves a persons awareness of sensations in the rectum, teaching how to coordinate squeezing of the external sphincter muscle with the sensation of rectal filling. Biofeedback training uses special sensors to measure bodily functions. Sensors include pressure or EMG sensors in the anus, pressure sensors in the rectum, and a balloon in the rectum to produce graded sensations of rectal fullness. The measurements are displayed on a video screen as sounds or line graphs. The health care provider uses the information to help the person modify or change abnormal function. The person practices the exercises at home. Success with pelvic floor exercises depends on the cause of fecal incontinence, its severity, and the persons motivation and ability to follow the health care providers recommendations.\n                \nSurgery\n                \nSurgery may be an option for fecal incontinence that fails to improve with other treatments or for fecal incontinence caused by pelvic floor or anal sphincter muscle injuries.\n                \n- Sphincteroplasty, the most common fecal incontinence surgery, reconnects the separated ends of a sphincter muscle torn by childbirth or another injury. Sphincteroplasty is performed at a hospital by a colorectal, gynecological, or general surgeon.  - Artificial anal sphincter involves placing an inflatable cuff around the anus and implanting a small pump beneath the skin that the person activates to inflate or deflate the cuff. This surgery is much less common and is performed at a hospital by a specially trained colorectal surgeon.  - Nonabsorbable bulking agents can be injected into the wall of the anus to bulk up the tissue around the anus. The bulkier tissues make the opening of the anus narrower so the sphincters are able to close better. The procedure is performed in a health care providers office; anesthesia is not needed. The person can return to normal physical activities 1 week after the procedure.  - Bowel diversion is an operation that reroutes the normal movement of stool out of the body when part of the bowel is removed. The operation diverts the lower part of the small intestine or colon to an opening in the wall of the abdomenthe area between the chest and hips. An external pouch is attached to the opening to collect stool. The procedure is performed by a surgeon in a hospital and anesthesia is used. More information about these procedures can be found in the Bowel Diversion fact sheet.\n                \nElectrical Stimulation\n                \nElectrical stimulation, also called sacral nerve stimulation or neuromodulation, involves placing electrodes in the sacral nerves to the anus and rectum and continuously stimulating the nerves with electrical pulses. The sacral nerves connect to the part of the spine in the hip area. A battery-operated stimulator is placed beneath the skin. Based on the persons response, the health care provider can adjust the amount of stimulation so it works best for that person. The person can turn the stimulator on or off at any time. The procedure is performed in an outpatient center using local anesthesia.",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Fecal incontinence is the inability to control bowel movements, causing stool (feces) to leak from the rectum. It can range from occasional leakage of a small amount of stool when passing gas to complete loss of bowel control. Fecal incontinence can be an embarrassing and isolating condition, but there are treatments available to help manage the symptoms. The causes can vary, from constipation and diarrhea to muscle or nerve damage, or more severe conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease or spinal cord injury. It is essential to consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan.",
        "original_answer": "Fecal incontinence can cause embarrassment, fear, and loneliness. Taking steps to cope is important. The following tips can help:\n                \n- carrying a bag with cleanup supplies and a change of clothes when leaving the house.  - finding public restrooms before one is needed.  - using the toilet before leaving home.  - wearing disposable underwear or absorbent pads inserted in the underwear.  - using fecal deodorantspills that reduce the smell of stool and gas. Although fecal deodorants are available over the counter, a health care provider can help people find them.\n                \nEating tends to trigger contractions of the large intestine that push stool toward the rectum and also cause the rectum to contract for 30 to 60 minutes. Both these events increase the likelihood that a person will pass gas and have a bowel movement soon after eating. This activity may increase if the person is anxious. People with fecal incontinence may want to avoid eating in restaurants or at social gatherings, or they may want to take antidiarrheal medications before eating in these situations.\n                \nAnal Discomfort   The skin around the anus is delicate and sensitive. Constipation and diarrhea or contact between skin and stool can cause pain or itching. The following steps can help relieve anal discomfort:   - Washing the anal area after a bowel movement. Washing with water, but not soap, can help prevent discomfort. Soap can dry out the skin, making discomfort worse. Ideally, the anal area should be washed in the shower with lukewarm water or in a sitz batha special plastic tub that allows a person to sit in a few inches of warm water. No-rinse skin cleansers, such as Cavilon, are a good alternative. Wiping with toilet paper further irritates the skin and should be avoided. Premoistened, alcohol-free towelettes are a better choice.   - Keeping the anal area dry. The anal area should be allowed to air dry after washing. If time doesnt permit air drying, the anal area can be gently patted dry with a lint-free cloth.   - Creating a moisture barrier. A moisture barrier cream that contains ingredients such as dimethiconea type of siliconecan help form a barrier between skin and stool. The anal area should be cleaned before applying barrier cream. However, people should talk with their health care provider before using anal creams and ointments because some can irritate the anus.   - Using nonmedicated powders. Nonmedicated talcum powder or cornstarch can also relieve anal discomfort. As with moisture barrier creams, the anal area should be clean and dry before use.   - Using wicking pads or disposable underwear. Pads and disposable underwear with a wicking layer can pull moisture away from the skin.   - Wearing breathable clothes and underwear. Clothes and underwear should allow air to flow and keep skin dry. Tight clothes or plastic or rubber underwear that blocks air can worsen skin problems.   - Changing soiled underwear as soon as possible.",

Dehydration: Frequent vomiting can lead to dehydration, which can cause symptoms such as dizziness, fatigue, and electrolyte imbalances.\n2. Malnutrition: CVS can make it difficult to maintain a healthy diet, leading to malnutrition and weight loss.\n3. Tooth decay: Frequent exposure to stomach acid during vomiting can erode tooth enamel and lead to tooth decay.\n4. Esophagitis: Repeated exposure to stomach acid during vomiting can cause inflammation of the esophagus (esophagitis), which can lead to pain, difficulty swallowing, and an increased risk of infection.\n5. Acid reflux: CVS can increase the risk of developing acid reflux, a condition in which stomach acid flows back up into the esophagus.\n6. Psychological distress: CVS can have a significant impact on a person's quality of life and lead to psychological distress, including anxiety and depression.\n\nIt is important to work with a healthcare provider to manage CVS and reduce the risk of these complications.

A diagnosis of CVS is usually made when a pattern of symptoms emerges over time and other potential causes have been excluded. It's important to consult with a healthcare professional if you suspect you have CVS.",
        "original_answer": "A specific test to diagnose cyclic vomiting syndrome does not exist; instead, a health care provider will rule out other conditions and diagnose the syndrome based upon\n                \n- a medical and family history  - a physical exam  - a pattern or cycle of symptoms  - blood tests  - urine tests  - imaging tests  - upper GI endoscopy  - a gastric emptying test\n                \nOften, it is suspected that one of the following is causing their symptoms:\n                \n- gastroparesisa disorder that slows or stops the movement of food from the stomach to the small intestine  - gastroenteritisinflammation of the lining of the stomach, small intestine, and large intestine\n                \nA diagnosis of cyclic vomiting syndrome may be difficult to make until the person sees a health care provider. A health care provider will suspect cyclic vomiting syndrome if the person suffers from repeat episodes of vomiting.\n                \nMedical and Family History\n                \nTaking a medical and family history is one of the first things a health care provider may do to help diagnose cyclic vomiting syndrome. He or she will ask the patient to provide a medical and family history.\n                \nPhysical Exam\n                \nA physical exam may help diagnose other conditions besides cyclic vomiting syndrome. During a physical exam, a health care provider usually\n                \n- examines a patients body  - taps on specific areas of the patients body\n                \nPattern or Cycle of Symptoms in Children3\n                \nA health care provider will often suspect cyclic vomiting syndrome in a child when the child\n                \n- has at least five separate episodes, or at least three separate episodes over 6 months  - has episodes of intense nausea and vomiting lasting 1 hour to 10 days and occurring at least 1 week apart  - has episodes that are similar to previous onesthey tend to start at the same time of day, last the same length of time, and occur with the same symptoms and level of intensity  - vomits during episodes at least four times per hour for at least 1 hour  - vomits and it is not attributed to another disorder  - has absence of nausea and vomiting between episodes\n                \nPattern or Cycle of Symptoms in Adults4,5\n                \nA health care provider will often suspect cyclic vomiting syndrome in adults when the following is present for at least 3 months and the symptoms started more than 6 months ago:\n                \n- Each episode of cyclic vomiting syndrome is usually similar to previous ones, meaning that episodes tend to start at the same time of day and last the same length of timeless than 1 week.  - Three or more separate episodes in the past year.  - Absence of nausea or vomiting between episodes.\n                \nBlood Tests\n                \nA nurse or technician will draw blood samples at a health care providers office or a commercial facility and send the samples to a lab for analysis. The blood test can tell the health care provider if the patient has any signs of dehydration or other problems.\n                \nUrine Tests\n                \nUrinalysis involves testing a urine sample. The patient collects a urine sample in a special container in a health care providers office or a commercial facility. A health care provider tests the sample in the same location or sends the sample to a lab for analysis. A urinalysis can rule out kidney problems or an infection.\n                \nImaging Tests\n                \nThe health care provider decides which test to order based on the symptoms, medical history, and physical exam.\n                \nUpper GI series. A health care provider may order an upper GI series to look at the upper GI tract. A radiologista doctor who specializes in medical imagingperforms this test at a hospital or an outpatient center. This test does not require anesthesia. The patient should not eat or drink for 8 hours before the procedure, if possible. During the procedure, the patient will stand or sit in front of an x-ray machine and drink barium, a chalky liquid. Infants lie on a table and a health care provider gives them barium through a tiny tube placed in the nose that runs into the stomach. Barium coats the GI tract, making signs of obstruction or other problems that can cause vomiting show up more clearly on x rays. A patient may experience bloating and nausea for a short time after the test. The upper GI series can show other problems that may be causing symptoms, such as an ulcer or obstruction.\n                \nAbdominal ultrasound. A health care provider may order an ultrasound to look at the organs in the abdomen. A technician uses a device, called a transducer, that bounces safe, painless sound waves off organs to create an image of their structure. The technician performs the procedure in a health care providers office, an outpatient center, or a hospital. A radiologist interprets the images. A patient does not need anesthesia. The abdominal ultrasound can show other problems that may be causing symptoms, such as gallstones.\n                \nUpper Gastrointestinal Endoscopy\n                \nThis procedure involves using an endoscopea small, flexible tube with a lightto see the upper GI tract. A gastroenterologista doctor who specializes in digestive diseasesperforms the test at a hospital or an outpatient center. A health care provider may give a patient a liquid anesthetic to gargle or may spray anesthetic on the back of the patients throat. A nurse or technician will place an IV needle in a vein in the arm to administer sedation or anesthesia. Sedatives or anesthesia help a patient stay relaxed and comfortable. The gastroenterologist carefully inserts the endoscope into the mouth and feeds the endoscope down the esophagus and into the stomach and duodenum. A small camera mounted on the endoscope transmits a video image to a monitor, allowing close examination of the intestinal lining. The upper GI endoscopy can show other problems that may be causing symptoms, such as an ulcer. A gastroenterologist may obtain a biopsya procedure that involves taking a small piece of tissue for examination with a microscopeof the small-intestinal lining during an upper GI endoscopy. The patient will not feel the biopsy.\n                \nGastric Emptying Test\n                \nAlso called gastric emptying scintigraphy, this test involves eating a bland mealsuch as eggs or an egg substitutethat contains a small amount of radioactive material. A specially trained technician performs the test in a radiology center or hospital, and a radiologist interprets the results; the patient does not need anesthesia. An external camera scans the abdomen to show where the radioactive material is located. The radiologist is then able to measure the rate of gastric emptying at 1, 2, 3, and 4 hours after the meal.",

The goal during the prodrome phase is to stop an episode before it progresses. Taking medication early in the phase can help stop an episode from moving to the vomiting phase or becoming severe; however, people do not always realize an episode is coming. For example, a person may wake up in the morning and begin vomiting. A health care provider may recommend the following medications for both children and adults:      - ondansetron (Zofran) or lorazepam (Ativan) for nausea    - ibuprofen for abdominal pain    - ranitidine (Zantac), lansoprazole (Prevacid), or omeprazole (Prilosec, Zegerid) to control stomach acid production    - sumatriptan (Imitrex)prescribed as a nasal spray, an injection, or a pill that dissolves under the tonguefor migraines    - Vomiting phase treatment. Once vomiting begins, people should call or see a health care provider as soon as possible. Treatment usually requires the person to stay in bed and sleep in a dark, quiet room. A health care provider may recommend the following for both children and adults:      - medication for pain, nausea, and reducing stomach acid and anxiety    - anti-migraine medications such as sumatriptan to stop symptoms of a migraine or possibly stop an episode in progress    - hospitalization for severe nausea and vomiting    - IV fluids and medications to prevent dehydration and treat symptoms    - IV nutrition if an episode continues for several days    - Recovery phase treatment. During the recovery phase, drinking and eating will replace lost electrolytes. A person may need IV fluids for a period of time. Some people find their appetite returns to normal right away, while others start by drinking clear liquids and then moving slowly to other liquids and solid food. A health care provider may prescribe medications during the recovery phase and well phase to prevent future episodes.  - Well phase treatment. During the well phase, a health care provider may use medications to treat people whose episodes are frequent and long lasting in an effort to prevent or ease future episodes. A person may need to take a medication daily for 1 to 2 months before evaluating whether it helps prevent episodes. A health care provider may prescribe the following medications for both children and adults during the well phase to prevent cyclic vomiting syndrome episodes, lessen their severity, and reduce their frequency:      - amitriptyline (Elavil)    - propranolol (Inderal)    - cyproheptadine (Periactin)",

        "original_answer": "Diabetes causes blood glucose levels to be above normal. People with diabetes have problems converting food to energy. After food is eaten, it is broken down into a sugar called glucose. Glucose is then carried by the blood to cells throughout the body. The hormone insulin, made in the pancreas, helps the body change blood glucose into energy. People with diabetes, however, either no longer make enough insulin, or their insulin doesn't work properly, or both.\n                \nType 2 diabetes\n                \nType 2 diabetes is the most common type in American Indians. This type of diabetes can occur at any age, even during childhood. People develop type 2 diabetes because the cells in the muscles, liver, and fat do not use insulin properly. Eventually, the body cannot make enough insulin. As a result, the amount of glucose in the blood increases while the cells are starved of energy. Over time, high blood glucose damages nerves and blood vessels, leading to problems such as heart disease, stroke, blindness, kidney failure, and amputation.\n                \nOther kinds of diabetes\n                \nType 1 diabetes\n                \nType 1 diabetes is rare in American Indians. People develop type 1 diabetes when their bodies no longer make any insulin. Type 1 is usually first diagnosed in children or young adults but can develop at any age.\n                \nGestational diabetes\n                \nGestational diabetes is first diagnosed during pregnancy. It occurs when the body doesn't use insulin properly. Having an American Indian family background raises the risk of developing gestational diabetes. Although this form of diabetes usually goes away after the baby is born, a woman who has had it is more likely to develop type 2 diabetes later in life.",

        "original_answer": "- Reach and maintain a reasonable body weight.  - Make wise food choices most of the time.  - Be physically active every day.  - Take your prescribed medicines.\n                \nDoing these things can reduce your risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Keeping your blood pressure and cholesterol on target also helps you stay healthy.\n                \nIf you are pregnant, plan to breastfeed your baby. Ask your health care provider for the names of people to call for help learning to breastfeed. Besides being good for your baby, breastfeeding is good for you. Studies done with the help of Pima Indian volunteers have shown that breastfeeding may lower the baby's risk of becoming overweight and getting diabetes.\n                \nGetting Started.\n                \nMaking changes in your life such as eating less can be hard. You can make the changes easier by taking these steps:\n                \n- Make a plan to change something that you do.  - Decide exactly what you will do and when you will do it.  - Plan what you need to get ready.  - Think about what might prevent you from reaching your goal.  - Find family and friends who will support and encourage you.  - Decide how you will reward yourselfwith a nonfood itemor activitywhen you do what you have planned.\n                \nYour health care provider, a registered dietitian, or a counselor can help you make a plan.\n                \nReach and Maintain a Reasonable Body Weight.\n                \nYour weight affects your health in many ways. Being overweight can keep your body from making and using insulin correctly. The extra weight may also cause high blood pressure. The DPP study showed that losing even a few pounds can help lower your risk of developing type 2 diabetes, because weight loss helps your body use insulin more effectively. Every pound you lose lowers your risk of getting diabetes. In the DPP, people who lost 5 to 7 percent of their body weight lowered their risk of developing type 2 diabetes. They had less than half the risk of developing diabetes as people who didn't make lifestyle changes. A 5- to 7-percent weight loss for a 150-pound person, for example, would be about 7 to 10 pounds. If you're overweight, choose sensible ways to lose weight.\n                \n- Don't use crash diets. Instead, eat smaller servings of the foods you usually have, and limit the amount of fat you eat.  - Increase your physical activity. Aim for at least 30 minutes of exercise most days of the week. Do something you enjoy, like biking or walking with a friend.  - Set a reasonable weight-loss goal, such as losing about a pound a week. Aim for a long-term goal of losing the number of pounds that's right for you.\n                \nChoosing My Weight Loss Goal.\n                \nLosing 5 to 7 percent of your total weight can help lower your risk of getting type 2 diabetes. You are more likely to lose weight if:\n                \n- you're physically active   - you cut down on fat and calories  - Use these steps to choose a goal. Talk with your health care provider and your dietitian about your goal and how to reach it.\n                \nTo find your weight loss goal for losing about 5 to 7 percent of your weight, find the weight closest to yours on the chart below.

By making wise food choices, you can help control your body weight, blood glucose, blood pressure, and cholesterol.\n                \n- Keep track of what you eat and drink. People who keep track are more successful in losing weight. You can use the Daily Food and Drink Tracker to write down what you eat and drink.   - Take a look at the serving sizes of the foods you eat. Reduce serving sizes of main courses, meat, desserts, and other foods high in fat. Increase the amount of fruits and vegetables at every meal. Below is a chart for choosing sensible serving sizes using your hand as a measuring guide. Because your hand is proportioned to the rest of your body, it can be used to measure a healthy serving size for your body. Remember, the chart is only a guide. Choose your serving sizes and foods wisely.  - Limit your fat intake to about 25 percent of your total calories. Your health care provider or dietitian can help you figure out how many grams of fat to have every day. You can check food labels for fat content. For example, if your food choices add up to about 2,000 calories a day, try to eat no more than 56 grams of fat. See Ways to Lower The Amount of Fat in Your Meals and Snacks.  - Cut down on calories by eating smaller servings and by cutting back on fat. People in the DPP lifestyle change group lowered their daily calorie total by an average of about 450 calories. Your health care provider or dietitian can work with you to develop a meal plan that helps you lose weight.  - Choose healthy commodity foods (items provided by the government to help people consume a nutritious diet), including those lower in fat.  - When you meet your goal, reward yourself with something special, like a new outfit or a movie.\n                \nChoose Sensible Serving Sizes\n                \nAmount of food    Types of food    Size of one serving (the same size as:)          3 ounces    meat, chicken, turkey, or fish    the palm of a hand or a deck of cards         1 cup    cooked vegetables salads casseroles or stews, such as chili with beans milk     an average-sized fist         1/2 cup    fruit or fruit juice starchy vegetables, such as potatoes or corn pinto beans and other dried beans rice or noodles cereal     half of an average-sized fist         1 ounce    snack food    one handful         1 Tablespoon    salad dressing    the tip of a thumb         1 teaspoon    margarine    a fingertip\n                \n\n                \nWays to Lower The Amount of Fat in Your Meals and Snacks\n                \n- Choose lower-fat foods. Example: Instead of sunflower seeds (20 grams of fat),  choose pretzels (1 gram).  Savings: 19 grams.    - Use low-fat versions of foods. Example: Instead of regular margarine (5 grams of fat),  use low-fat margarine (2 grams). Savings: 3 grams.    - Use low-fat seasonings. Example: Instead of putting butter and sour cream on your baked potato  (20 grams of fat), have salsa (0 grams). Savings: 20 grams.    - Cook with less fat. Example: Instead of making fried chicken (31 grams of fat),  roast or grill the chicken (9 grams). Savings: 22 grams.\n                \nRemember that low-fat or fat-free products still contain calories. Be careful about how much you eat. In fact, some low-fat or fat-free products are high in calories. Check the food label\n                \nBe Physically Active Every Day\n                \n- Keep track of what you do for exercise and how long you do it. Use the Daily Physical Activity Tracker to keep track of your physical activity.  - Aim for at least 30 minutes of physical activity a day most days of the week.  - Incorporate physical activity into plans with family and friends. Set a good example for your children. Play softball on weekends. Go on a family hike.  - Be active every day. For example, walk to the store, clean the house, or work in the garden, rather than watch TV.\n                \nGetting Started on a Walking Routine\n                \nWalking is a great way to be physically active. Before you get started, talk with your health care provider about whether it's OK for you to walk for exercise. Then get comfortable shoes that provide good support. You can use the Daily Physical Activity Tracker to start your routine gradually. Try to walk at least 5 times a week. Build up little by little to 30 minutes a day of brisk walking.\n                \nMy Walking Program\n                \nWeek number    Warm-up time (minutes) Walk slowly    Fast walk time (minutes) Walk briskly    Cool-down time (minutes) Walk slowly    Total (minutes)          1    5    5    5    15        2    5    8    5    18        3    5    11    5    21        4    5    14    5    24        5    5    17    5    27        6    5    20    5    30        7    5    23    5    33        8    5    26    5    36        9+    5    30    5    40\n                \nTake Your Prescribed Medicines\n                \n\n                \n\n                \nDaily Food and Drink Tracker\n                \nUse the Daily Food and Drink Tracker to keep track of everything you eat and drink.

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Preventing diabetes problems, particularly those related to heart and blood vessels, involves several steps:\n\n1. **Control your blood sugar levels:** Consistently high blood sugar can damage your heart and blood vessels over time. Work with your healthcare provider to develop a plan to keep your blood sugar within your target range.\n\n2. **Maintain a healthy blood pressure:** High blood pressure can damage your blood vessels, making them less flexible and more prone to damage. Aim for a blood pressure below 130/80 mmHg.\n\n3. **Keep your cholesterol levels in check:** High cholesterol can lead to plaque buildup in your arteries, increasing your risk of heart disease and stroke. Your LDL (\"bad\") cholesterol should be below 100 mg/dL, and your HDL (\"good\") cholesterol should be above 40 mg/dL for men and 50 mg/dL for women.\n\n4. **Don't smoke:** Smoking damages your blood vessels, making them more likely to become narrow and stiff, leading to heart disease and other complications.\n\n5. **Stay physically active:** Regular exercise can help control your blood sugar, reduce your risk of heart disease, and help you maintain a healthy weight.\n\n6. **Eat a healthy diet:** A diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats can help manage your blood sugar, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels.\n\n7. **Lose weight if you're overweight:** Excess weight, particularly around your middle, can increase your risk of heart disease and other complications.\n\n8. **Get regular check-ups:** Regular screenings can help detect any potential problems early, when they're easier to treat.\n\nRemember, it's important to work with your healthcare provider to develop a plan that's tailored to your individual needs and circumstances.",

        "original_answer": "You can do a lot to prevent heart disease and stroke.\n                \n- Keep your blood glucose under control. You can see if your blood glucose is under control by having an A1C test at least twice a year. The A1C test tells you your average blood glucose for the past 2 to 3 months. The target for most people with diabetes is below 7. In some people with heart disease or other special circumstances, their doctor may recommend slightly higher levels of A1C.  - Keep your blood pressure under control. Have it checked at every doctor visit. The target for most people with diabetes is below 140/80, unless their doctor sets a different target.  - Keep your cholesterol under control. Have it checked at least once a year. The targets for most people with diabetes are      - LDLbadcholesterol: below 100    - HDLgoodcholesterol: above 40 in men and above 50 in women    - triglyceridesanother type of fat in the blood: below 150    - Make sure the foods you eat are \"heart-healthy.\" Include foods high in fiber, such as oat bran, oatmeal, whole-grain breads and cereals, fruits, and vegetables. Cut back on foods high in saturated fat or cholesterol, such as meats, butter, dairy products with fat, eggs, shortening, lard, and foods with palm oil or coconut oil. Limit foods with trans fat, such as snack foods and commercial baked goods.  - If you smoke, quit. Your doctor can tell you about ways to help you quit smoking.  - Ask your doctor whether you should take an aspirin every day. Studies have shown that taking a low dose of aspirin every day can help reduce your risk of heart disease and stroke.  - Take your medicines as directed.",

        "original_answer": "Narrowed blood vessels leave a smaller opening for blood to flow through. Having narrowed blood vessels is like turning on a garden hose and holding your thumb over the opening. The smaller opening makes the water shoot out with more pressure. In the same way, narrowed blood vessels lead to high blood pressure. Other factors, such as kidney problems and being overweight, also can lead to high blood pressure.\n                \nMany people with diabetes also have high blood pressure. If you have heart, eye, or kidney problems from diabetes, high blood pressure can make them worse.\n                \nYou will see your blood pressure written with two numbers separated by a slash.

Malnutrition: Prolonged illness can result in insufficient nutrient intake, particularly in children, leading to malnutrition and related health issues.\n\n3. Electrolyte imbalance: Persistent vomiting and diarrhea can cause an imbalance in essential electrolytes like sodium, potassium, and chloride, potentially leading to severe complications such as seizures, muscle spasms, or irregular heart rhythms.\n\n4. Bacterial infections: In some cases, viral gastroenteritis can make the body more susceptible to secondary bacterial infections, such as those caused by E. coli or Salmonella.\n\n5. Lactose intolerance: Temporary lactose intolerance can develop after a viral gastroenteritis episode due to damaged gut lining. This usually resolves on its own within a few weeks.\n\n6.

Rotavirus infections are most common in infants 3 to 15 months old. Symptoms usually appear 1 to 3 days after exposure. Rotavirus typically causes vomiting and watery diarrhea for 3 to 7 days, along with fever and abdominal pain. Rotavirus can also infect adults who are in close contact with infected children, but the symptoms in adults are milder.\n                \nCaliciviruses\n                \nCaliciviruses cause infection in people of all ages. Norovirus is the most common calicivirus and the most common cause of viral gastroenteritis in adults. Norovirus is usually responsible for epidemics of viral gastroenteritis. Norovirus outbreaks occur all year but are more frequent from October to April. People infected with norovirus typically experience nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, fatigue, headache, and muscle aches. The symptoms usually appear 1 to 2 days after exposure to the virus and last for 1 to 3 days.\n                \nAdenovirus\n                \nAdenovirus mainly infects children younger than 2 years old. Of the 49 types of adenoviruses, one strain affects the gastrointestinal tract, causing vomiting and diarrhea. Symptoms typically appear 8 to 10 days after exposure and last 5 to 12 days. Adenovirus infections occur year-round.\n                \nAstrovirus\n                \nAstrovirus primarily infects infants and young children, but adults may also be infected. This virus causes vomiting and watery diarrhea. Symptoms usually appear 3 to 4 days after exposure and last 2 to 7 days. The symptoms are milder than the symptoms of norovirus or rotavirus infections. Infections occur year-round, but the virus is most active during the winter months.\n                \nViral gastroenteritis is often mistakenly called stomach flu, but it is not caused by the influenza virus. Some forms of gastroenteritis are caused by bacteria or parasites rather than viruses.

They may also ask about your recent symptoms, including:\n\n* Nausea or vomiting\n* Diarrhea\n* Abdominal cramps or pain\n* Fever\n* Headache\n* Muscle aches\n\nIf you have severe symptoms or are at risk for complications, your healthcare provider may recommend additional tests, such as a stool test, to confirm the diagnosis and determine the specific virus causing the infection.\n\nIt's important to note that viral gastroenteritis is highly contagious and can spread easily in community settings like schools, childcare centers, and nursing homes. If you suspect you have the stomach flu, it's important to practice good hygiene, such as washing your hands frequently and avoiding close contact with others, to prevent the spread of the virus.",
        "original_answer": "Viral gastroenteritis is usually diagnosed based on symptoms alone. People who have symptoms that are severe or last for more than a few days may want to see a health care provider for additional tests. A health care provider may ask for a stool sample to test for rotavirus or norovirus or to rule out bacteria or parasites as the cause of the gastroenteritis.\n                \nDuring an epidemic of viral gastroenteritis, health care providers or public health officials may test stool samples to find out which virus is responsible for the outbreak.",

The large intestine changes waste from liquid to a solid matter called stool. Stool passes from the colon to the rectum. The rectum is located between the lower, or sigmoid, colon and the anus. The rectum stores stool prior to a bowel movement, when stool moves from the rectum to the anus and out of a person's body.",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "The exact cause of ulcerative colitis is unknown, but it is thought to be related to an abnormal response of the immune system to the presence of bacteria in the digestive tract. This response causes inflammation and ulcers in the lining of the colon and rectum. Genetic and environmental factors may also play a role in the development of the disease. It is important to note that ulcerative colitis is not caused by stress, eating certain foods, or lack of cleanliness.",
        "original_answer": "The exact cause of ulcerative colitis is unknown. Researchers believe the following factors may play a role in causing ulcerative colitis:\n                \n- overactive intestinal immune system  - genes  - environment\n                \nOveractive intestinal immune system. Scientists believe one cause of ulcerative colitis may be an abnormal immune reaction in the intestine. Normally, the immune system protects the body from infection by identifying and destroying bacteria, viruses, and other potentially harmful foreign substances. Researchers believe bacteria or viruses can mistakenly trigger the immune system to attack the inner lining of the large intestine. This immune system response causes the inflammation, leading to symptoms.\n                \nGenes. Ulcerative colitis sometimes runs in families. Research studies have shown that certain abnormal genes may appear in people with ulcerative colitis. However, researchers have not been able to show a clear link between the abnormal genes and ulcerative colitis.\n                \nEnvironment. Some studies suggest that certain things in the environment may increase the chance of a person getting ulcerative colitis, although the overall chance is low. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,1 antibiotics,1 and oral contraceptives2 may slightly increase the chance of developing ulcerative colitis. A high-fat diet may also slightly increase the chance of getting ulcerative colitis.3\n                \nSome people believe eating certain foods, stress, or emotional distress can cause ulcerative colitis. Emotional distress does not seem to cause ulcerative colitis. A few studies suggest that stress may increase a person's chance of having a flare-up of ulcerative colitis. Also, some people may find that certain foods can trigger or worsen symptoms.",

During a physical exam, the health care provider most often\n                \n- checks for abdominal distension, or swelling  - listens to sounds within the abdomen using a stethoscope  - taps on the abdomen to check for tenderness and pain\n                \nLab Tests\n                \nA health care provider may order lab tests to help diagnose ulcerative colitis, including blood and stool tests.\n                \nBlood tests. A blood test involves drawing blood at a health care provider's office or a lab. A lab technologist will analyze the blood sample. A health care provider may use blood tests to look for\n                \n- anemia  - inflammation or infection somewhere in the body  - markers that show ongoing inflammation  - low albumin, or proteincommon in patients with severe ulcerative colitis\n                \nStool tests. A stool test is the analysis of a sample of stool. A health care provider will give the patient a container for catching and storing the stool at home. The patient returns the sample to the health care provider or to a lab. A lab technologist will analyze the stool sample. Health care providers commonly order stool tests to rule out other causes of GI diseases, such as infection.\n                \nEndoscopies of the Large Intestine\n                \nEndoscopies of the large intestine are the most accurate methods for diagnosing ulcerative colitis and ruling out other possible conditions, such as Crohn's disease, diverticular disease, or cancer. Endoscopies of the large intestine include\n                \n- colonoscopy  - flexible sigmoidoscopy\n                \nColonoscopy. Colonoscopy is a test that uses a long, flexible, narrow tube with a light and tiny camera on one end, called a colonoscope or scope, to look inside the rectum and entire colon. In most cases, light anesthesia and pain medication help patients relax for the test. The medical staff will monitor a patient's vital signs and try to make him or her as comfortable as possible. A nurse or technician places an intravenous (IV) needle in a vein in the patient's arm or hand to give anesthesia.\n                \nFor the test, the patient will lie on a table or stretcher while the gastroenterologist inserts a colonoscope into the patient's anus and slowly guides it through the rectum and into the colon. The scope inflates the large intestine with air to give the gastroenterologist a better view. The camera sends a video image of the intestinal lining to a monitor, allowing the gastroenterologist to carefully examine the tissues lining the colon and rectum. The gastroenterologist may move the patient several times and adjust the scope for better viewing. Once the scope has reached the opening to the small intestine, the gastroenterologist slowly withdraws it and examines the lining of the colon and rectum again.\n                \nA colonoscopy can show irritated and swollen tissue, ulcers, and abnormal growths such as polypsextra pieces of tissue that grow on the inner lining of the intestine. If the gastroenterologist suspects ulcerative colitis, he or she will biopsy the patient's colon and rectum. A biopsy is a procedure that involves taking small pieces of tissue for examination with a microscope.\n                \nA health care provider will give patients written bowel prep instructions to follow at home before the test. The health care provider will also give patients information about how to care for themselves following the procedure.\n                \nFlexible sigmoidoscopy. Flexible sigmoidoscopy is a test that uses a flexible, narrow tube with a light and tiny camera on one end, called a sigmoidoscope or scope, to look inside the rectum, the sigmoid colon, and sometimes the descending colon. In most cases, a patient does not need anesthesia.\n                \nFor the test, the patient will lie on a table or stretcher while the health care provider inserts the sigmoidoscope into the patient's anus and slowly guides it through the rectum, the sigmoid colon, and sometimes the descending colon.

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Ulcerative colitis is typically treated with medications such as aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, immunomodulators, and biologics to reduce inflammation and suppress the immune system. Severe cases may require hospitalization, intravenous medications, or even surgery to remove the colon. Lifestyle modifications such as stress management, a balanced diet, and regular exercise may also help manage symptoms. It's important to work closely with a healthcare provider to determine the best treatment plan.",
        "original_answer": "A health care provider treats ulcerative colitis with\n                \n- medications  - surgery\n                \nWhich treatment a person needs depends on the severity of the disease and the symptoms. Each person experiences ulcerative colitis differently, so health care providers adjust treatments to improve the person's symptoms and induce, or bring about, remission.\n                \nMedications\n                \nWhile no medication cures ulcerative colitis, many can reduce symptoms. The goals of medication therapy are\n                \n- inducing and maintaining remission  - improving the person's quality of life\n                \nMany people with ulcerative colitis require medication therapy indefinitely, unless they have their colon and rectum surgically removed.\n                \nHealth care providers will prescribe the medications that best treat a person's symptoms:\n                \n- aminosalicylates  - corticosteroids  - immunomodulators  - biologics, also called anti-TNF therapies  - other medications\n                \nDepending on the location of the symptoms in the colon, health care providers may recommend a person take medications by\n                \n- enema, which involves flushing liquid medication into the rectum using a special wash bottle. The medication directly treats inflammation of the large intestine.  - rectal foama foamy substance the person puts into the rectum like an enema. The medication directly treats inflammation of the large intestine.  - suppositorya solid medication the person inserts into the rectum to dissolve. The intestinal lining absorbs the medication.  - mouth.  - IV.\n                \nAminosalicylates are medications that contain 5-aminosalicyclic acid (5-ASA), which helps control inflammation. Health care providers typically use aminosalicylates to treat people with mild or moderate symptoms or help people stay in remission. Aminosalicylates can be prescribed as an oral medication or a topical medicationby enema or suppository. Combination therapyoral and rectalis most effective, even in people with extensive ulcerative colitis.5 Aminosalicylates are generally well tolerated.\n                \nAminosalicylates include\n                \n- balsalazide  - mesalamine  - olsalazine  - sulfasalazinea combination of sulfapyridine and 5-ASA\n                \nSome of the common side effects of aminosalicylates include\n                \n- abdominal pain  - diarrhea  - headaches  - nausea\n                \nHealth care providers may order routine blood tests for kidney function, as aminosalicylates can cause a rare allergic reaction in the kidneys.\n                \nCorticosteroids, also known as steroids, help reduce the activity of the immune system and decrease inflammation. Health care providers prescribe corticosteroids for people with more severe symptoms and people who do not respond to aminosalicylates. Health care providers do not typically prescribe corticosteroids for long-term use.\n                \nCorticosteroids are effective in bringing on remission; however, studies have not shown that the medications help maintain long-term remission. Corticosteroids include\n                \n- budesonide  - hydrocortisone  - methylprednisone  - prednisone\n                \nSide effects of corticosteroids include\n                \n- acne  - a higher chance of developing infections  - bone mass loss  - death of bone tissue  - high blood glucose  - high blood pressure  - mood swings  - weight gain\n                \nPeople who take budesonide may have fewer side effects than with other steroids.\n                \nImmunomodulators reduce immune system activity, resulting in less inflammation in the colon. These medications can take several weeks to 3 months to start working. Immunomodulators include\n                \n- azathioprine  - 6-mercaptopurine, or 6-MP\n                \nHealth care providers prescribe these medications for people who do not respond to 5-ASAs. People taking these medications may have the following side effects:\n                \n- abnormal liver tests  - feeling tired  - infection  - low white blood cell count, which can lead to a higher chance of infection  - nausea and vomiting  - pancreatitis  - slightly increased chance of lymphoma  - slightly increased chance of nonmelanoma skin cancers\n                \nHealth care providers routinely test blood counts and liver function of people taking immunomodulators. People taking these medications should also have yearly skin cancer exams.\n                \nPeople should talk with their health care provider about the risks and benefits of immunomodulators.\n                \nBiologicsincluding adalimumab, golimumab, infliximab, and vedolizumabare medications that target a protein made by the immune system called tumor necrosis factor (TNF). These medications decrease inflammation in the large intestine by neutralizing TNF. Anti-TNF therapies work quickly to bring on remission, especially in people who do not respond to other medications. Infliximab and vedolizumab are given through an IV; adalimumab and golimumab are given by injection.\n                \nHealth care providers will screen patients for tuberculosis and hepatitis B before starting treatment with anti-TNF medications.\n                \nSide effects of anti-TNF medications may include\n                \n- a higher chance of developing infectionsespecially tuberculosis or fungal infection  - skin cancermelanoma  - psoriasis\n                \nOther medications to treat symptoms or complications may include\n                \n- acetaminophen for mild pain. People with ulcerative colitis should avoid using ibuprofen, naproxen, and aspirin since these medications can make symptoms worse.  - antibiotics to prevent or treat infections.  - loperamide to help slow or stop diarrhea. In most cases, people only take this medication for short periods of time since it can increase the chance of developing megacolon. People should check with a health care provider before taking loperamide, because those with significantly active ulcerative colitis should not take this medication.6  - cyclosporinehealth care providers prescribe this medication only for people with severe ulcerative colitis because of the side effects. People should talk with their health care provider about the risks and benefits of cyclosporine.\n                \nSurgery\n                \nSome people will need surgery to treat their ulcerative colitis when they have\n                \n- colon cancer  - dysplasia, or precancerous cells in the colon  - complications that are life threatening, such as megacolon or bleeding  - no improvement in symptoms or condition despite treatment  - continued dependency on steroids  - side effects from medications that threaten their health\n                \nRemoval of the entire colon, including the rectum, \"cures\" ulcerative colitis. A surgeon performs the procedure at a hospital. A surgeon can perform two different types of surgery to remove a patient's colon and treat ulcerative colitis:\n                \n- proctocolectomy and ileostomy  - proctocolectomy and ileoanal reservoir\n                \nFull recovery from both operations may take 4 to 6 weeks.\n                \nProctocolectomy and ileostomy. A proctocolectomy is surgery to remove a patient's entire colon and rectum. An ileostomy is a stoma, or opening in the abdomen, that a surgeon creates from a part of the ileumthe last section of the small intestine. The surgeon brings the end of the ileum through an opening in the patient's abdomen and attaches it to the skin, creating an opening outside of the patient's body. The stoma most often is located in the lower part of the patient's abdomen, just below the beltline.\n                \nA removable external collection pouch, called an ostomy pouch or ostomy appliance, connects to the stoma and collects intestinal contents outside the patient's body. Intestinal contents pass through the stoma instead of passing through the anus. The stoma has no muscle, so it cannot control the flow of intestinal contents, and the flow occurs whenever peristalsis occurs. Peristalsis is the movement of the organ walls that propels food and liquid through the GI tract.\n                \nPeople who have this type of surgery will have the ileostomy for the rest of their lives.\n                \nProctocolectomy and ileoanal reservoir. An ileoanal reservior is an internal pouch made from the patient's ileum. This surgery is a common alternative to an ileostomy and does not have a permanent stoma. Ileoanal reservoir is also known as a J-pouch, a pelvic pouch, or an ileoanal pouch anastamosis. The ileoanal reservior connects the ileum to the anus. The surgeon preserves the outer muscles of the patient's rectum during the proctocolectomy. Next, the surgeon creates the ileal pouch and attaches it to the end of the rectum. Waste is stored in the pouch and passes through the anus.\n                \nAfter surgery, bowel movements may be more frequent and watery than before the procedure. People may have fecal incontinencethe accidental passing of solid or liquid stool or mucus from the rectum. Medications can be used to control pouch function. Women may be infertile following the surgery.\n                \nMany people develop pouchitis in the ileoanal reservoir. Pouchitis is an irritation or inflammation of the lining of the ileoanal reservoir. A health care provider treats pouchitis with antibiotics. Rarely, pouchitis can become chronic and require long-term antibiotics or other medications.\n                \nThe surgeon will recommend one of the operations based on a person's symptoms, severity of disease, expectations, age, and lifestyle. Before making a decision, the person should get as much information as possible by talking with\n                \n- health care providers  - enterostomal therapists, nurses who work with colon-surgery patients  - people who have had one of the surgeries\n                \nPatient-advocacy organizations can provide information about support groups and other resources.\n                \nMore information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, ostomy surgery.",

People with ulcerative colitis should talk with their health care provider about how often they should get screened for colon cancer. Screening can include colonoscopy with biopsies or a special dye spray called chromoendoscopy.   Health care providers may recommend colonoscopy every 1 to 3 years for people with ulcerative colitis who have   - the disease in one-third or more or of their colon   - had ulcerative colitis for 8 years    Such screening does not reduce a person's chances of developing colon cancer.

Amyloid deposits damage the kidneys and make it harder for them to filter wastes and break down proteins. When the kidneys become too damaged, they may no longer be able to function well enough to maintain health, resulting in kidney failure. Kidney failure can lead to problems such as high blood pressure, bone disease, and anemiaa condition in which the body has fewer red blood cells than normal.\n                \nDialysis-related Amyloidosis\n                \nPeople who suffer from kidney failure and have been on long-term dialysis may develop dialysis-related amyloidosis. This type of amyloidosis occurs when a certain protein, called beta-2 microglobulin, builds up in the blood because dialysis does not remove it completely. The two types of dialysis are\n                \n- hemodialysis. Hemodialysis uses a special filter called a dialyzer to remove wastes and extra fluid from the blood.  - peritoneal dialysis. Peritoneal dialysis uses the lining of the abdominal cavitythe space in the body that holds organs such as the stomach, intestines, and liverto filter the blood.\n                \nDialysis-related amyloidosis is a complication of kidney failure because neither hemodialysis nor peritoneal dialysis effectively filters beta-2 microglobulin from the blood. As a result, elevated amounts of beta-2 microglobulin remain in the blood. Dialysis-related amyloidosis is relatively common in people with kidney failure, especially adults older than 60 years of age, who have been on dialysis for more than 5 years.1\n                \nMore information is provided in the NIDDK health topics:\n                \n- Treatment Methods for Kidney Failure: Hemodialysis  - Treatment Methods for Kidney Failure: Peritoneal Dialysis",

He or she will ask the patient to provide a medical and family history.\n                \nPhysical Exam\n                \nA physical exam may help diagnose primary amyloidosis of the kidneys. During a physical exam, a health care provider usually\n                \n- examines a patients body to check for swelling  - uses a stethoscope to listen to the lungs  - taps on specific areas of the patients body\n                \nUrinalysis\n                \nA health care provider may use urinalysisthe testing of a urine sampleto check for albumin and amyloid proteins in urine. The patient provides a urine sample in a special container at a health care providers office or a commercial facility. A nurse or technician can test the sample in the same location or send it to a lab for analysis. More-than-normal amounts of albumin in urine may indicate kidney damage due to primary amyloidosis. Amyloid proteins in urine may indicate amyloidosis.\n                \nBlood Tests\n                \nThe health care provider may use blood tests to see how well the kidneys are working and to check for amyloid proteins and hyperlipidemia. A blood test involves drawing a patients blood at a health care providers office or a commercial facility and sending the sample to a lab for analysis. Blood tests for kidney function measure the waste products in the blood that healthy kidneys normally filter out. Hyperlipidemia may indicate nephrotic syndrome. Amyloid proteins in blood may indicate amyloidosis.\n                \nKidney Biopsy\n                \nOnly a biopsy can show the amyloid protein deposits in the kidneys. A health care provider may recommend a kidney biopsy if other tests show kidney damage. A kidney biopsy is a procedure that involves taking a piece of kidney tissue for examination with a microscope. A health care provider performs a kidney biopsy in a hospital with light sedation and local anesthetic. The health care provider uses imaging techniques such as ultrasound or a computerized tomography (CT) scan to guide the biopsy needle into the kidney and take the tissue sample. A pathologista doctor who specializes in diagnosing diseasesexamines the tissue in a lab for amyloid proteins and kidney damage.\n                \nThe biopsy results can help the health care provider determine the best course of treatment.

The goal of medication therapy, including chemotherapy, is to reduce amyloid protein levels in the blood. Many health care providers recommend combination medication therapy such as\n                \n- melphalan (Alkeran), a type of chemotherapy  - dexamethasone (Decadron), an anti-inflammatory steroid medication\n                \nThese medications can stop the growth of the cells that make amyloid proteins. These medications may cause hair loss and serious side effects, such as nausea, vomiting, and fatigue.\n                \nStem cell transplant. A stem cell transplant is a procedure that replaces a patients damaged stem cells with healthy ones. Stem cells are found in the bone marrow and develop into three types of blood cells the body needs. To prepare for a stem cell transplant, the patient receives high doses of chemotherapy. The actual transplant is like a blood transfusion. The transplanted stem cells travel to the bone marrow to make healthy new blood cells. The chemotherapy a patient receives to prepare for the transplant can have serious side effects, so it is important to talk with the health care provider about the risks of this procedure.\n                \nRead more in What Is a Blood and Marrow Stem Cell Transplant? at www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/bmsct.\n                \nTreating other conditions.

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Hypoglycemia refers to a condition where the blood sugar level drops below normal. This can occur due to various reasons such as skipping meals, taking too much insulin, or certain medications. Symptoms of hypoglycemia include sweating, shaking, confusion, and rapid heartbeat. If left untreated, it can lead to more severe complications like seizures or loss of consciousness. If you suspect you have hypoglycemia, it is essential to seek medical attention promptly.",
        "original_answer": "Hypoglycemia, also called low blood glucose or low blood sugar, occurs when blood glucose drops below normal levels. Glucose, an important source of energy for the body, comes from food. Carbohydrates are the main dietary source of glucose. Rice, potatoes, bread, tortillas, cereal, milk, fruit, and sweets are all carbohydrate-rich foods.\n                \nAfter a meal, glucose is absorbed into the bloodstream and carried to the body's cells. Insulin, a hormone made by the pancreas, helps the cells use glucose for energy. If a person takes in more glucose than the body needs at the time, the body stores the extra glucose in the liver and muscles in a form called glycogen. The body can use glycogen for energy between meals. Extra glucose can also be changed to fat and stored in fat cells. Fat can also be used for energy.\n                \nWhen blood glucose begins to fall, glucagonanother hormone made by the pancreassignals the liver to break down glycogen and release glucose into the bloodstream. Blood glucose will then rise toward a normal level. In some people with diabetes, this glucagon response to hypoglycemia is impaired and other hormones such as epinephrine, also called adrenaline, may raise the blood glucose level. But with diabetes treated with insulin or pills that increase insulin production, glucose levels can't easily return to the normal range.\n                \nHypoglycemia can happen suddenly. It is usually mild and can be treated quickly and easily by eating or drinking a small amount of glucose-rich food. If left untreated, hypoglycemia can get worse and cause confusion, clumsiness, or fainting. Severe hypoglycemia can lead to seizures, coma, and even death.\n                \nIn adults and children older than 10 years, hypoglycemia is uncommon except as a side effect of diabetes treatment. Hypoglycemia can also result, however, from other medications or diseases, hormone or enzyme deficiencies, or tumors.",

        "original_answer": "Diabetes treatment plans are designed to match the dose and timing of medication to a person's usual schedule of meals and activities. Mismatches could result in hypoglycemia. For example, taking a dose of insulinor other medication that increases insulin levelsbut then skipping a meal could result in hypoglycemia.\n                \nTo help prevent hypoglycemia, people with diabetes should always consider the following:\n                \n- Their diabetes medications. A health care provider can explain which diabetes medications can cause hypoglycemia and explain how and when to take medications. For good diabetes management, people with diabetes should take diabetes medications in the recommended doses at the recommended times. In some cases, health care providers may suggest that patients learn how to adjust medications to match changes in their schedule or routine.  - Their meal plan. A registered dietitian can help design a meal plan that fits one's personal preferences and lifestyle. Following one's meal plan is important for managing diabetes. People with diabetes should eat regular meals, have enough food at each meal, and try not to skip meals or snacks. Snacks are particularly important for some people before going to sleep or exercising. Some snacks may be more effective than others in preventing hypoglycemia overnight. The dietitian can make recommendations for snacks.  - Their daily activity. To help prevent hypoglycemia caused by physical activity, health care providers may advise      - checking blood glucose before sports, exercise, or other physical activity and having a snack if the level is below 100 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL)    - adjusting medication before physical activity    - checking blood glucose at regular intervals during extended periods of physical activity and having snacks as needed    - checking blood glucose periodically after physical activity    - Their use of alcoholic beverages. Drinking alcoholic beverages, especially on an empty stomach, can cause hypoglycemia, even a day or two later. Heavy drinking can be particularly dangerous for people taking insulin or medications that increase insulin production. Alcoholic beverages should always be consumed with a snack or meal at the same time. A health care provider can suggest how to safely include alcohol in a meal plan.  - Their diabetes management plan. Intensive diabetes managementkeeping blood glucose as close to the normal range as possible to prevent long-term complicationscan increase the risk of hypoglycemia. Those whose goal is tight control should talk with a health care provider about ways to prevent hypoglycemia and how best to treat it if it occurs.\n                \nWhat to Ask the Doctor about Diabetes Medications\n                \nPeople who take diabetes medications should ask their doctor or health care provider\n                \n- whether their diabetes medications could cause hypoglycemia  - when they should take their diabetes medications  - how much medication they should take  - whether they should keep taking their diabetes medications when they are sick  - whether they should adjust their medications before physical activity  - whether they should adjust their medications if they skip a meal",

If blood sugar levels are still low, repeat the process.\n4. Once blood sugar levels are normal, consume a snack or meal to maintain normal blood sugar levels.\n\nIf hypoglycemia is severe, recurrent, or accompanied by loss of consciousness, it is a medical emergency and requires immediate medical attention.",
        "original_answer": "Signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia vary from person to person. People with diabetes should get to know their signs and symptoms and describe them to their friends and family so they can help if needed. School staff should be told how to recognize a child's signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia and how to treat it.\n                \nPeople who experience hypoglycemia several times in a week should call their health care provider. They may need a change in their treatment plan: less medication or a different medication, a new schedule for insulin or medication, a different meal plan, or a new physical activity plan.\n                \nPrompt Treatment for Hypoglycemia\n                \nWhen people think their blood glucose is too low, they should check the blood glucose level of a blood sample using a meter. If the level is below 70 mg/dL, one of these quick-fix foods should be consumed right away to raise blood glucose:\n                \n- 3 or 4 glucose tablets  - 1 serving of glucose gelthe amount equal to 15 grams of carbohydrate  - 1/2 cup, or 4 ounces, of any fruit juice  - 1/2 cup, or 4 ounces, of a regularnot dietsoft drink  - 1 cup, or 8 ounces, of milk  - 5 or 6 pieces of hard candy  - 1 tablespoon of sugar or honey\n                \nRecommended amounts may be less for small children. The child's doctor can advise about the right amount to give a child.\n                \nThe next step is to recheck blood glucose in 15 minutes to make sure it is 70 mg/dL or above. If it's still too low, another serving of a quick-fix food should be eaten. These steps should be repeated until the blood glucose level is 70 mg/dL or above. If the next meal is an hour or more away, a snack should be eaten once the quick-fix foods have raised the blood glucose level to 70 mg/dL or above.\n                \nFor People Who Take Acarbose (Precose) or Miglitol (Glyset)\n                \nPeople who take either of these diabetes medications should know that only pure glucose, also called dextroseavailable in tablet or gel formwill raise their blood glucose level during a low blood glucose episode. Other quick-fix foods and drinks won't raise the level quickly enough because acarbose and miglitol slow the digestion of other forms of carbohydrate.\n                \nHelp from Others for Severe Hypoglycemia\n                \nSevere hypoglycemiavery low blood glucosecan cause a person to pass out and can even be life threatening. Severe hypoglycemia is more likely to occur in people with type 1 diabetes. People should ask a health care provider what to do about severe hypoglycemia. Another person can help someone who has passed out by giving an injection of glucagon. Glucagon will rapidly bring the blood glucose level back to normal and help the person regain consciousness. A health care provider can prescribe a glucagon emergency kit. Family, friends, or coworkersthe people who will be around the person at risk of hypoglycemiacan learn how to give a glucagon injection and when to call 911 or get medical help.\n                \nPhysical Activity and Blood Glucose Levels\n                \nPhysical activity has many benefits for people with diabetes, including lowering blood glucose levels. However, physical activity can make levels too low and can cause hypoglycemia up to 24 hours afterward. A health care provider can advise about checking the blood glucose level before exercise. For those who take insulin or one of the oral medications that increase insulin production, the health care provider may suggest having a snack if the glucose level is below 100 mg/dL or adjusting medication doses before physical activity to help avoid hypoglycemia. A snack can prevent hypoglycemia. The health care provider may suggest extra blood glucose checks, especially after strenuous exercise.\n                \nHypoglycemia When Driving\n                \nHypoglycemia is particularly dangerous if it happens to someone who is driving. People with hypoglycemia may have trouble concentrating or seeing clearly behind the wheel and may not be able to react quickly to road hazards or to the actions of other drivers. To prevent problems, people at risk for hypoglycemia should check their blood glucose level before driving. During longer trips, they should check their blood glucose level frequently and eat snacks as needed to keep the level at 70 mg/dL or above. If necessary, they should stop for treatment and then make sure their blood glucose level is 70 mg/dL or above before starting to drive again.\n                \nHypoglycemia Unawareness\n                \nSome people with diabetes do not have early warning signs of low blood glucose, a condition called hypoglycemia unawareness. This condition occurs most often in people with type 1 diabetes, but it can also occur in people with type 2 diabetes. People with hypoglycemia unawareness may need to check their blood glucose level more often so they know when hypoglycemia is about to occur. They also may need a change in their medications, meal plan, or physical activity routine.\n                \nHypoglycemia unawareness develops when frequent episodes of hypoglycemia lead to changes in how the body reacts to low blood glucose levels. The body stops releasing the hormone epinephrine and other stress hormones when blood glucose drops too low. The loss of the body's ability to release stress hormones after repeated episodes of hypoglycemia is called hypoglycemia-associated autonomic failure, or HAAF.\n                \nEpinephrine causes early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia such as shakiness, sweating, anxiety, and hunger. Without the release of epinephrine and the symptoms it causes, a person may not realize that hypoglycemia is occurring and may not take action to treat it. A vicious cycle can occur in which frequent hypoglycemia leads to hypoglycemia unawareness and HAAF, which in turn leads to even more severe and dangerous hypoglycemia. Studies have shown that preventing hypoglycemia for a period as short as several weeks can sometimes break this cycle and restore awareness of symptoms. Health care providers may therefore advise people who have had severe hypoglycemia to aim for higher-than-usual blood glucose targets for short-term periods.\n                \nBeing Prepared for Hypoglycemia\n                \nPeople who use insulin or take an oral diabetes medication that can cause low blood glucose should always be prepared to prevent and treat low blood glucose by\n                \n- learning what can trigger low blood glucose levels  - having their blood glucose meter available to test glucose levels; frequent testing may be critical for those with hypoglycemia unawareness, particularly before driving a car or engaging in any hazardous activity  - always having several servings of quick-fix foods or drinks handy  - wearing a medical identification bracelet or necklace  - planning what to do if they develop severe hypoglycemia  - telling their family, friends, and coworkers about the symptoms of hypoglycemia and how they can help if needed\n                \nNormal and Target Blood Glucose Ranges          Normal Blood Glucose Levels in People Who Do Not Have Diabetes          Upon wakingfasting    70 to 99 mg/dL        After meals    70 to 140 mg/dL          Target Blood Glucose Levels in People Who Have Diabetes          Before meals    70 to 130 mg/dL        1 to 2 hours after the start of a meal    below 180 mg/dL\n                \nFor people with diabetes, a blood glucose level below 70 mg/dL is considered hypoglycemia.",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar, can be treated by:\n\n1. Consuming 15-20 grams of fast-acting carbohydrates, such as fruit juice, glucose tablets, or hard candies.\n2. Waiting for 15 minutes, then rechecking blood sugar levels.\n3. If blood sugar levels are still low, repeat the process.\n4. Once blood sugar levels are normal, consume a snack or meal to maintain normal blood sugar levels.\n\nIf hypoglycemia is severe, recurrent, or accompanied by loss of consciousness, it is a medical emergency and requires immediate medical attention.",
        "original_answer": "Signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia vary from person to person. People with diabetes should get to know their signs and symptoms and describe them to their friends and family so they can help if needed. School staff should be told how to recognize a child's signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia and how to treat it.\n                \nPeople who experience hypoglycemia several times in a week should call their health care provider. They may need a change in their treatment plan: less medication or a different medication, a new schedule for insulin or medication, a different meal plan, or a new physical activity plan.\n                \nPrompt Treatment for Hypoglycemia\n                \nWhen people think their blood glucose is too low, they should check the blood glucose level of a blood sample using a meter. If the level is below 70 mg/dL, one of these quick-fix foods should be consumed right away to raise blood glucose:\n                \n- 3 or 4 glucose tablets  - 1 serving of glucose gelthe amount equal to 15 grams of carbohydrate  - 1/2 cup, or 4 ounces, of any fruit juice  - 1/2 cup, or 4 ounces, of a regularnot dietsoft drink  - 1 cup, or 8 ounces, of milk  - 5 or 6 pieces of hard candy  - 1 tablespoon of sugar or honey\n                \nRecommended amounts may be less for small children. The child's doctor can advise about the right amount to give a child.\n                \nThe next step is to recheck blood glucose in 15 minutes to make sure it is 70 mg/dL or above. If it's still too low, another serving of a quick-fix food should be eaten. These steps should be repeated until the blood glucose level is 70 mg/dL or above. If the next meal is an hour or more away, a snack should be eaten once the quick-fix foods have raised the blood glucose level to 70 mg/dL or above.\n                \nFor People Who Take Acarbose (Precose) or Miglitol (Glyset)\n                \nPeople who take either of these diabetes medications should know that only pure glucose, also called dextroseavailable in tablet or gel formwill raise their blood glucose level during a low blood glucose episode. Other quick-fix foods and drinks won't raise the level quickly enough because acarbose and miglitol slow the digestion of other forms of carbohydrate.\n                \nHelp from Others for Severe Hypoglycemia\n                \nSevere hypoglycemiavery low blood glucosecan cause a person to pass out and can even be life threatening. Severe hypoglycemia is more likely to occur in people with type 1 diabetes. People should ask a health care provider what to do about severe hypoglycemia. Another person can help someone who has passed out by giving an injection of glucagon. Glucagon will rapidly bring the blood glucose level back to normal and help the person regain consciousness. A health care provider can prescribe a glucagon emergency kit. Family, friends, or coworkersthe people who will be around the person at risk of hypoglycemiacan learn how to give a glucagon injection and when to call 911 or get medical help.\n                \nPhysical Activity and Blood Glucose Levels\n                \nPhysical activity has many benefits for people with diabetes, including lowering blood glucose levels. However, physical activity can make levels too low and can cause hypoglycemia up to 24 hours afterward. A health care provider can advise about checking the blood glucose level before exercise. For those who take insulin or one of the oral medications that increase insulin production, the health care provider may suggest having a snack if the glucose level is below 100 mg/dL or adjusting medication doses before physical activity to help avoid hypoglycemia. A snack can prevent hypoglycemia. The health care provider may suggest extra blood glucose checks, especially after strenuous exercise.\n                \nHypoglycemia When Driving\n                \nHypoglycemia is particularly dangerous if it happens to someone who is driving. People with hypoglycemia may have trouble concentrating or seeing clearly behind the wheel and may not be able to react quickly to road hazards or to the actions of other drivers. To prevent problems, people at risk for hypoglycemia should check their blood glucose level before driving. During longer trips, they should check their blood glucose level frequently and eat snacks as needed to keep the level at 70 mg/dL or above. If necessary, they should stop for treatment and then make sure their blood glucose level is 70 mg/dL or above before starting to drive again.\n                \nHypoglycemia Unawareness\n                \nSome people with diabetes do not have early warning signs of low blood glucose, a condition called hypoglycemia unawareness. This condition occurs most often in people with type 1 diabetes, but it can also occur in people with type 2 diabetes. People with hypoglycemia unawareness may need to check their blood glucose level more often so they know when hypoglycemia is about to occur. They also may need a change in their medications, meal plan, or physical activity routine.\n                \nHypoglycemia unawareness develops when frequent episodes of hypoglycemia lead to changes in how the body reacts to low blood glucose levels. The body stops releasing the hormone epinephrine and other stress hormones when blood glucose drops too low. The loss of the body's ability to release stress hormones after repeated episodes of hypoglycemia is called hypoglycemia-associated autonomic failure, or HAAF.\n                \nEpinephrine causes early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia such as shakiness, sweating, anxiety, and hunger. Without the release of epinephrine and the symptoms it causes, a person may not realize that hypoglycemia is occurring and may not take action to treat it. A vicious cycle can occur in which frequent hypoglycemia leads to hypoglycemia unawareness and HAAF, which in turn leads to even more severe and dangerous hypoglycemia. Studies have shown that preventing hypoglycemia for a period as short as several weeks can sometimes break this cycle and restore awareness of symptoms. Health care providers may therefore advise people who have had severe hypoglycemia to aim for higher-than-usual blood glucose targets for short-term periods.\n                \nBeing Prepared for Hypoglycemia\n                \nPeople who use insulin or take an oral diabetes medication that can cause low blood glucose should always be prepared to prevent and treat low blood glucose by\n                \n- learning what can trigger low blood glucose levels  - having their blood glucose meter available to test glucose levels; frequent testing may be critical for those with hypoglycemia unawareness, particularly before driving a car or engaging in any hazardous activity  - always having several servings of quick-fix foods or drinks handy  - wearing a medical identification bracelet or necklace  - planning what to do if they develop severe hypoglycemia  - telling their family, friends, and coworkers about the symptoms of hypoglycemia and how they can help if needed\n                \nNormal and Target Blood Glucose Ranges          Normal Blood Glucose Levels in People Who Do Not Have Diabetes          Upon wakingfasting    70 to 99 mg/dL        After meals    70 to 140 mg/dL          Target Blood Glucose Levels in People Who Have Diabetes          Before meals    70 to 130 mg/dL        1 to 2 hours after the start of a meal    below 180 mg/dL\n                \nFor people with diabetes, a blood glucose level below 70 mg/dL is considered hypoglycemia.",

        "original_answer": "Two types of hypoglycemia can occur in people who do not have diabetes:\n                \n- Reactive hypoglycemia, also called postprandial hypoglycemia, occurs within 4 hours after meals.  - Fasting hypoglycemia, also called postabsorptive hypoglycemia, is often related to an underlying disease.\n                \nSymptoms of both reactive and fasting hypoglycemia are similar to diabetes-related hypoglycemia. Symptoms may include hunger, sweating, shakiness, dizziness, light-headedness, sleepiness, confusion, difficulty speaking, anxiety, and weakness.\n                \nTo find the cause of a patient's hypoglycemia, the doctor will use laboratory tests to measure blood glucose, insulin, and other chemicals that play a part in the body's use of energy.\n                \nReactive Hypoglycemia\n                \nDiagnosis\n                \nTo diagnose reactive hypoglycemia, the doctor may\n                \n- ask about signs and symptoms  - test blood glucose while the patient is having symptoms by taking a blood sample from the arm and sending it to a laboratory for analysis*  - check to see whether the symptoms ease after the patient's blood glucose returns to 70 mg/dL or above after eating or drinking\n                \nA blood glucose level below 70 mg/dL at the time of symptoms and relief after eating will confirm the diagnosis. The oral glucose tolerance test is no longer used to diagnose reactive hypoglycemia because experts now know the test can actually trigger hypoglycemic symptoms.\n                \nCauses and Treatment\n                \nThe causes of most cases of reactive hypoglycemia are still open to debate. Some researchers suggest that certain people may be more sensitive to the body's normal release of the hormone epinephrine, which causes many of the symptoms of hypoglycemia. Others believe deficiencies in glucagon secretion might lead to reactive hypoglycemia.\n                \nA few causes of reactive hypoglycemia are certain, but they are uncommon. Gastricor stomachsurgery can cause reactive hypoglycemia because of the rapid passage of food into the small intestine. Rare enzyme deficiencies diagnosed early in life, such as hereditary fructose intolerance, also may cause reactive hypoglycemia.\n                \nTo relieve reactive hypoglycemia, some health professionals recommend\n                \n- eating small meals and snacks about every 3 hours  - being physically active  - eating a variety of foods, including meat, poultry, fish, or nonmeat sources of protein; starchy foods such as whole-grain bread, rice, and potatoes; fruits; vegetables; and dairy products  - eating foods high in fiber  - avoiding or limiting foods high in sugar, especially on an empty stomach\n                \nThe doctor can refer patients to a registered dietitian for personalized meal planning advice. Although some health professionals recommend a diet high in protein and low in carbohydrates, studies have not proven the effectiveness of this kind of diet to treat reactive hypoglycemia.\n                \nFasting Hypoglycemia\n                \nDiagnosis\n                \nFasting hypoglycemia is diagnosed from a blood sample that shows a blood glucose level below 50 mg/dL after an overnight fast, between meals, or after physical activity.\n                \nCauses and Treatment\n                \nCauses of fasting hypoglycemia include certain medications, alcoholic beverages, critical illnesses, hormonal deficiencies, some kinds of tumors, and certain conditions occurring in infancy and childhood.\n                \nMedications. Medications, including some used to treat diabetes, are the most common cause of hypoglycemia. Other medications that can cause hypoglycemia include\n                \n- salicylates, including aspirin, when taken in large doses  - sulfa medications, which are used to treat bacterial infections  - pentamidine, which treats a serious kind of pneumonia  - quinine, which is used to treat malaria\n                \nIf using any of these medications causes a person's blood glucose level to fall, the doctor may advise stopping the medication or changing the dose.\n                \nAlcoholic beverages. Drinking alcoholic beverages, especially binge drinking, can cause hypoglycemia. The body's breakdown of alcohol interferes with the liver's efforts to raise blood glucose. Hypoglycemia caused by excessive drinking can be serious and even fatal.\n                \nCritical illnesses. Some illnesses that affect the liver, heart, or kidneys can cause hypoglycemia. Sepsis, which is an overwhelming infection, and starvation are other causes of hypoglycemia. In these cases, treating the illness or other underlying cause will correct the hypoglycemia.\n                \nHormonal deficiencies. Hormonal deficiencies may cause hypoglycemia in very young children, but rarely in adults. Shortages of cortisol, growth hormone, glucagon, or epinephrine can lead to fasting hypoglycemia. Laboratory tests for hormone levels will determine a diagnosis and treatment. Hormone replacement therapy may be advised.\n                \nTumors. Insulinomas are insulin-producing tumors in the pancreas. Insulinomas can cause hypoglycemia by raising insulin levels too high in relation to the blood glucose level. These tumors are rare and do not normally spread to other parts of the body. Laboratory tests can pinpoint the exact cause. Treatment involves both short-term steps to correct the hypoglycemia and medical or surgical measures to remove the tumor.\n                \nConditions occurring in infancy and childhood. Children rarely develop hypoglycemia. If they do, causes may include the following:\n                \n- Brief intolerance to fasting, often during an illness that disturbs regular eating patterns. Children usually outgrow this tendency by age 10.  - Hyperinsulinism, which is the overproduction of insulin. This condition can result in temporary hypoglycemia in newborns, which is common in infants of mothers with diabetes. Persistent hyperinsulinism in infants or children is a complex disorder that requires prompt evaluation and treatment by a specialist.  - Enzyme deficiencies that affect carbohydrate metabolism. These deficiencies can interfere with the body's ability to process natural sugars, such as fructose and galactose, glycogen, or other metabolites.  - Hormonal deficiencies such as lack of pituitary or adrenal hormones.\n                \n\n                \n*A personal blood glucose monitor cannot be used to diagnose reactive hypoglycemia.",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is a skin manifestation of celiac disease and can be diagnosed using the following steps:\n\n1. Medical History: Take a detailed medical history of the patient, including symptoms, family history, and dietary habits.\n2. Physical Examination: Perform a thorough physical examination, focusing on the skin for characteristic lesions of DH, such as intensely itchy, grouped vesicles or papules, often symmetrically distributed on the extensor surfaces of the elbows, knees, buttocks, and scalp.\n3. Direct Immunofluorescence (DIF): Perform a skin biopsy of an active lesion and examine it using DIF. The presence of granular IgA deposits in the dermal papillae is diagnostic of DH.\n4. Blood Tests: Order serologic tests, such as tissue transglutaminase (tTG) or endomysial antibodies (EMA), to confirm the diagnosis of celiac disease. However, these tests may be negative in some patients with DH.\n5. Intestinal Biopsy: Perform an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with biopsy of the duodenum to confirm the diagnosis of celiac disease. The presence of villous atrophy, crypt hyperplasia, and increased intraepithelial lymphocytes is diagnostic of celiac disease.\n6. Dietary Challenge: If the diagnosis is still uncertain, consider a gluten-free diet trial to assess for resolution of skin lesions and improvement in symptoms.\n\nIt is important to note that a definitive diagnosis of DH requires both the presence of characteristic skin lesions and positive DIF results, along with confirmation of celiac disease through serologic tests and/or intestinal biopsy.",
        "original_answer": "A skin biopsy is the first step in diagnosing DH. Direct immunofluorescence of clinically normal skin adjacent to a lesion shows granular IgA deposits in the upper dermis. Histology of lesional skin may show microabscesses containing neutrophils and eosinophils. However, histology may reveal only excoriation due to the intense itching that patients experience.\n                \nBlood tests for antiendomysial or anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies may also suggest celiac disease. Blood tests for epidermal transglutaminase antibodies are positive in more than 90 percent of cases.5 All of these tests will become negative with prolonged adherence to a gluten-free diet.\n                \nA positive biopsy and serology confirm DH and should be taken as indirect evidence of small bowel damage. A biopsy of the small bowel is usually not needed for DH diagnosis. However, if clinical signs of gastrointestinal disease are evident on examination, further workup may be required.2 Whether or not intestinal damage is evident, a gluten-free diet should be implemented because the rash of DH is gluten sensitive.4",

The first-line treatment is dapsone, an antibiotic that controls the itchy, blistering rash. However, it does not address the underlying celiac disease. A strict, lifelong gluten-free diet is essential for managing both DH and celiac disease. This diet eliminates barley, rye, and wheat, preventing immune system reactions, intestinal damage, and associated symptoms. Regular follow-ups with a healthcare professional are necessary to monitor treatment progress, nutritional status, and adjust the treatment plan as needed.",
        "original_answer": "The sulfone dapsone can provide immediate relief of symptoms. For patients who cannot tolerate dapsone, sulfapyridine or sulfamethoxypyridazine may be used, although these medications are less effective than dapsone. A strict gluten-free diet is the only treatment for the underlying disease. Even with a gluten-free diet, medication therapy may need to be continued from a few months to 2 years.\n                \nDH can go into remission, which is defined as absence of skin lesions and symptoms of DH for more than 2 years while not taking sulfones or other treatments and not adhering to a gluten-free diet.

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "To diagnose diabetes, a doctor typically reviews a patient's medical history, performs a physical exam, and orders diagnostic tests. The most common tests used to diagnose diabetes are:\n\n1. Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG) Test: This measures your blood sugar after not eating for at least eight hours. A fasting blood sugar level less than 100 mg/dL is normal. A fasting blood sugar level from 100 to 125 mg/dL is considered prediabetes. If it's 126 mg/dL or higher on two separate tests, you have diabetes.\n2. Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT): For this test, you fast overnight, and the fasting blood sugar level is measured. Then you drink a sugary liquid, and blood sugar levels are tested periodically for the next two hours. A blood sugar level less than 140 mg/dL is normal.

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Diverticular disease is a condition that affects the colon, or large intestine. It is characterized by the presence of small sacs or pouches (diverticula) that form in the wall of the colon. These sacs can become inflamed or infected, leading to symptoms such as abdominal pain, bloating, and changes in bowel movements. There are two types of diverticular disease: diverticulosis and diverticulitis.\n\nDiverticulosis is the presence of diverticula in the colon without any inflammation or infection. Many people with diverticulosis do not have any symptoms and do not require treatment. However, in some cases, diverticulosis can lead to complications such as bleeding, infection, or inflammation.\n\nDiverticulitis occurs when the diverticula become inflamed or infected, often due to a blockage or tear in the sacs. This can cause symptoms such as severe abdominal pain, fever, nausea, and vomiting. Diverticulitis is typically treated with antibiotics and a liquid diet to allow the colon to rest. In severe cases, hospitalization and surgery may be necessary.\n\nIt is important to note that the exact cause of diverticular disease is not known, but it is thought to be related to a low-fiber diet, aging, and genetic factors. Eating a high-fiber diet, staying hydrated, and exercising regularly may help prevent diverticular disease. If you have symptoms of diverticular disease, it is important to speak with a healthcare provider for proper diagnosis and treatment.",
        "original_answer": "Diverticular disease is a condition that occurs when a person has problems from small pouches, or sacs, that have formed and pushed outward through weak spots in the colon wall. Each pouch is called a diverticulum. Multiple pouches are called diverticula.\n                \nThe colon is part of the large intestine. The large intestine absorbs water from stool and changes it from a liquid to a solid form. Diverticula are most common in the lower part of the colon, called the sigmoid colon.\n                \nThe problems that occur with diverticular disease include diverticulitis and diverticular bleeding. Diverticulitis occurs when the diverticula become inflamed, or irritated and swollen, and infected. Diverticular bleeding occurs when a small blood vessel within the wall of a diverticulum bursts.",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Diverticular disease is caused by small pouches or sacs, called diverticula, that form in the lining of the digestive tract, usually in the colon. These pouches bulge outward and can become inflamed or infected, causing diverticulitis. The exact cause of diverticular disease is not known, but it is thought to be related to a low-fiber diet, aging, and increased pressure in the colon. Chronic constipation or straining during bowel movements can also contribute to the development of diverticular disease.",
        "original_answer": "Scientists are not certain what causes diverticulosis and diverticular disease. For more than 50 years, the most widely accepted theory was that a low-fiber diet led to diverticulosis and diverticular disease. Diverticulosis and diverticular disease were first noticed in the United States in the early 1900s, around the time processed foods were introduced into the American diet. Consumption of processed foods greatly reduced Americans fiber intake. Diverticulosis and diverticular disease are common in Western and industrialized countriesparticularly the United States, England, and Australiawhere low-fiber diets are common. The condition is rare in Asia and Africa, where most people eat high-fiber diets.1 Two large studies also indicate that a low-fiber diet may increase the chance of developing diverticular disease.2\n                \nHowever, a recent study found that a low-fiber diet was not associated with diverticulosis and that a high-fiber diet and more frequent bowel movements may be linked to an increased rather than decreased chance of diverticula.3\n                \nOther studies have focused on the role of decreased levels of the neurotransmitter serotonin in causing decreased relaxation and increased spasms of the colon muscle. A neurotransmitter is a chemical that helps brain cells communicate with nerve cells. However, more studies are needed in this area.\n                \nStudies have also found links between diverticular disease and obesity, lack of exercise, smoking, and certain medications including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as aspirin, and steroids.3\n                \nScientists agree that with diverticulitis, inflammation may begin when bacteria or stool get caught in a diverticulum. In the colon, inflammation also may be caused by a decrease in healthy bacteria and an increase in disease-causing bacteria. This change in the bacteria may permit chronic inflammation to develop in the colon.\n                \n\n                \nWhat is fiber?   Fiber is a substance in foods that comes from plants. Fiber helps soften stool so it moves smoothly through the colon and is easier to pass. Soluble fiber dissolves in water and is found in beans, fruit, and oat products. Insoluble fiber does not dissolve in water and is found in whole-grain products and vegetables. Both kinds of fiber help prevent constipation.   Constipation is a condition in which an adult has fewer than three bowel movements a week or has bowel movements with stools that are hard, dry, and small, making them painful or difficult to pass.   High-fiber foods also have many benefits in preventing and controlling chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, obesity, diabetes, and cancer.2",

During these procedures, the doctor can also take biopsies if needed.\n\nRemember, it's important to consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis.",
        "original_answer": "Diverticulosis\n                \nHealth care providers often find diverticulosis during a routine x ray or a colonoscopy, a test used to look inside the rectum and entire colon to screen for colon cancer or polyps or to evaluate the source of rectal bleeding.\n                \nDiverticular Disease\n                \nBased on symptoms and severity of illness, a person may be evaluated and diagnosed by a primary care physician, an emergency department physician, a surgeon, or a gastroenterologista doctor who specializes in digestive diseases.\n                \nThe health care provider will ask about the persons health, symptoms, bowel habits, diet, and medications, and will perform a physical exam, which may include a rectal exam. A rectal exam is performed in the health care providers office; anesthesia is not needed. To perform the exam, the health care provider asks the person to bend over a table or lie on one side while holding the knees close to the chest. The health care provider slides a gloved, lubricated finger into the rectum. The exam is used to check for pain, bleeding, or a blockage in the intestine.\n                \nThe health care provider may schedule one or more of the following tests:\n                \n- Blood test. A blood test involves drawing a persons blood at a health care providers office, a commercial facility, or a hospital and sending the sample to a lab for analysis. The blood test can show the presence of inflammation or anemiaa condition in which red blood cells are fewer or smaller than normal, which prevents the bodys cells from getting enough oxygen.  - Computerized tomography (CT) scan. A CT scan of the colon is the most common test used to diagnose diverticular disease. CT scans use a combination of x rays and computer technology to create three-dimensional (3D) images. For a CT scan, the person may be given a solution to drink and an injection of a special dye, called contrast medium. CT scans require the person to lie on a table that slides into a tunnel-shaped device where the x rays are taken. The procedure is performed in an outpatient center or a hospital by an x-ray technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologista doctor who specializes in medical imaging. Anesthesia is not needed. CT scans can detect diverticulosis and confirm the diagnosis of diverticulitis.  - Lower gastrointestinal (GI) series. A lower GI series is an x-ray exam that is used to look at the large intestine. The test is performed at a hospital or an outpatient center by an x-ray technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologist. Anesthesia is not needed. The health care provider may provide written bowel prep instructions to follow at home before the test. The person may be asked to follow a clear liquid diet for 1 to 3 days before the procedure. A laxative or enema may be used before the test. A laxative is medication that loosens stool and increases bowel movements. An enema involves flushing water or laxative into the rectum using a special squirt bottle. These medications cause diarrhea, so the person should stay close to a bathroom during the bowel prep.   - For the test, the person will lie on a table while the radiologist inserts a flexible tube into the persons anus. The colon is filled with barium, making signs of diverticular disease show up more clearly on x rays.  - For several days, traces of barium in the large intestine can cause stools to be white or light colored. Enemas and repeated bowel movements may cause anal soreness. A health care provider will provide specific instructions about eating and drinking after the test.  - Colonoscopy. The test is performed at a hospital or an outpatient center by a gastroenterologist. Before the test, the persons health care provider will provide written bowel prep instructions to follow at home. The person may need to follow a clear liquid diet for 1 to 3 days before the test. The person may also need to take laxatives and enemas the evening before the test.  - In most cases, light anesthesia, and possibly pain medication, helps people relax for the test. The person will lie on a table while the gastroenterologist inserts a flexible tube into the anus. A small camera on the tube sends a video image of the intestinal lining to a computer screen. The test can show diverticulosis and diverticular disease.  - Cramping or bloating may occur during the first hour after the test. Driving is not permitted for 24 hours after the test to allow the anesthesia time to wear off. Before the appointment, people should make plans for a ride home. Full recovery is expected by the next day, and people should be able to go back to their normal diet.",

Diet: A high-fiber diet can help prevent diverticular disease and alleviate its symptoms. This includes foods like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes.\n\n2. Medication: Over-the-counter pain relievers and anti-inflammatory drugs can help manage pain and inflammation. If you experience constipation, your doctor may prescribe a laxative or recommend an over-the-counter product.\n\n3.

The most common surgical procedures are laparoscopic lavage and bowel resection.\n\nRemember, it's important to consult with your healthcare provider for a personalized treatment plan.",
        "original_answer": "A health care provider may treat the symptoms of diverticulosis with a high-fiber diet or fiber supplements, medications, and possibly probiotics. Treatment for diverticular disease varies, depending on whether a person has diverticulitis or diverticular bleeding.\n                \nDiverticulosis\n                \nHigh-fiber diet. Studies have shown that a high-fiber diet can help prevent diverticular disease in people who already have diverticulosis.2 A health care provider may recommend a slow increase in dietary fiber to minimize gas and abdominal discomfort. For more information about fiber-rich foods, see Eating, Diet, and Nutrition.\n                \nFiber supplements. A health care provider may recommend taking a fiber product such as methylcellulose (Citrucel) or psyllium (Metamucil) one to three times a day. These products are available as powders, pills, or wafers and provide 0.5 to 3.5 grams of fiber per dose. Fiber products should be taken with at least 8 ounces of water.\n                \nMedications. A number of studies suggest the medication mesalazine (Asacol), given either continuously or in cycles, may be effective at reducing abdominal pain and GI symptoms of diverticulosis. Research has also shown that combining mesalazine with the antibiotic rifaximin (Xifaxan) can be significantly more effective than using rifaximin alone to improve a persons symptoms and maintain periods of remission, which means being free of symptoms.4\n                \nProbiotics. Although more research is needed, probiotics may help treat the symptoms of diverticulosis, prevent the onset of diverticulitis, and reduce the chance of recurrent symptoms. Probiotics are live bacteria, like those normally found in the GI tract. Probiotics can be found in dietary supplementsin capsules, tablets, and powdersand in some foods, such as yogurt.\n                \nTo help ensure coordinated and safe care, people should discuss their use of complementary and alternative medical practices, including their use of dietary supplements and probiotics, with their health care provider. Read more at www.nccam.nih.gov/health/probiotics.\n                \nTips for talking with health care providers are available at www.nccam.nih.gov/timetotalk.\n                \nDiverticular Bleeding\n                \nDiverticular bleeding is rare. Bleeding can be severe; however, it may stop by itself and not require treatment. A person who has bleeding from the rectumeven a small amountshould see a health care provider right away.\n                \nTo treat the bleeding, a colonoscopy may be performed to identify the location of and stop the bleeding. A CT scan or angiogram also may be used to identify the site of the bleeding. A traditional angiogram is a special kind of x ray in which a thin, flexible tube called a catheter is threaded through a large artery, often from the groin, to the area of bleeding. Contrast medium is injected through the catheter so the artery shows up more clearly on the x ray. The procedure is performed in a hospital or an outpatient center by an x-ray technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologist. Anesthesia is not needed, though a sedative may be given to lessen anxiety during the procedure.\n                \nIf the bleeding does not stop, abdominal surgery with a colon resection may be necessary. In a colon resection, the surgeon removes the affected part of the colon and joins the remaining ends of the colon together; general anesthesia is used. A blood transfusion may be needed if the person has lost a significant amount of blood.\n                \nDiverticulitis\n                \nDiverticulitis with mild symptoms and no complications usually requires a person to rest, take oral antibiotics, and be on a liquid diet for a period of time. If symptoms ease after a few days, the health care provider will recommend gradually adding solid foods back into the diet.\n                \nSevere cases of diverticulitis with acute pain and complications will likely require a hospital stay. Most cases of severe diverticulitis are treated with intravenous (IV) antibiotics and a few days without food or drink to help the colon rest. If the period without food or drink is longer, the person may be given parenteral nutritiona method of providing an IV liquid food mixture through a special tube in the chest. The mixture contains proteins, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins, and minerals.",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Diverticular disease can be treated with a combination of dietary changes, medication, and, in some cases, surgery.\n\n1. Diet: A high-fiber diet can help prevent diverticular disease and alleviate its symptoms. This includes foods like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes.\n\n2. Medication: Over-the-counter pain relievers and anti-inflammatory drugs can help manage pain and inflammation. If you experience constipation, your doctor may prescribe a laxative or recommend an over-the-counter product.\n\n3. Surgery: If diverticulitis leads to complications like abscesses, perforations, or obstructions, surgery may be necessary. The two main surgical procedures are primary bowel resection and bowel resection with colostomy. \n\nRemember, it's important to consult with your healthcare provider for a personalized treatment plan.",
        "original_answer": "Diverticulitis can attack suddenly and cause complications, such as\n                \n- an abscessa painful, swollen, pus-filled area just outside the colon wallcaused by infection  - a perforationa small tear or hole in the diverticula  - peritonitisinflammation of tissues inside the abdomen from pus and stool that leak through a perforation  - a fistulaan abnormal passage, or tunnel, between two organs, or between an organ and the outside of the body  - intestinal obstructionpartial or total blockage of movement of food or stool through the intestines\n                \nThese complications need to be treated to prevent them from getting worse and causing serious illness. In some cases, surgery may be needed.\n                \nAbscess, perforation, and peritonitis. Antibiotic treatment of diverticulitis usually prevents or treats an abscess. If the abscess is large or does not clear up with antibiotics, it may need to be drained. After giving the person numbing medication, a radiologist inserts a needle through the skin to the abscess and then drains the fluid through a catheter. The procedure is usually guided by an abdominal ultrasound or a CT scan. Ultrasound uses a device, called a transducer, that bounces safe, painless sound waves off organs to create an image of their structure.\n                \nA person with a perforation usually needs surgery to repair the tear or hole. Sometimes, a person needs surgery to remove a small part of the intestine if the perforation cannot be repaired.\n                \nA person with peritonitis may be extremely ill, with nausea, vomiting, fever, and severe abdominal tenderness. This condition requires immediate surgery to clean the abdominal cavity and possibly a colon resection at a later date after a course of antibiotics. A blood transfusion may be needed if the person has lost a significant amount of blood. Without prompt treatment, peritonitis can be fatal.\n                \nFistula. Diverticulitis-related infection may lead to one or more fistulas. Fistulas usually form between the colon and the bladder, small intestine, or skin. The most common type of fistula occurs between the colon and the bladder. Fistulas can be corrected with a colon resection and removal of the fistula.\n                \nIntestinal obstruction. Diverticulitis-related inflammation or scarring caused by past inflammation may lead to intestinal obstruction. If the intestine is completely blocked, emergency surgery is necessary, with possible colon resection. Partial blockage is not an emergency, so the surgery or other procedures to correct it can be scheduled.\n                \nWhen urgent surgery with colon resection is necessary for diverticulitis, two procedures may be needed because it is not safe to rejoin the colon right away. During the colon resection, the surgeon performs a temporary colostomy, creating an opening, or stoma, in the abdomen. The end of the colon is connected to the opening to allow normal eating while healing occurs. Stool is collected in a pouch attached to the stoma on the abdominal wall. In the second surgery, several months later, the surgeon rejoins the ends of the colon and closes the stoma.",

        "original_answer": "- Diverticular disease is a condition that occurs when a person has problems from small pouches, or sacs, that have formed and pushed outward through weak spots in the colon wall. The problems that occur with diverticular disease include diverticulitis and diverticular bleeding.  - When a person has diverticula that do not cause diverticulitis or diverticular bleeding, the condition is called diverticulosis.  - Scientists are not certain what causes diverticulosis and diverticular disease.  - Although diverticular disease is generally thought to be a condition found in older adults, it is becoming more common in people younger than age 50, most of whom are male.  - Health care providers often find diverticulosis during a routine x ray or a colonoscopy, a test used to look inside the rectum and entire colon to screen for colon cancer or polyps or to evaluate the source of rectal bleeding.  - To diagnose diverticular disease, a health care provider may schedule one or more of the following tests: blood test; computerized tomography (CT) scan; lower gastrointestinal (GI) series; colonoscopy.  - A health care provider may treat the symptoms of diverticulosis with a high-fiber diet or fiber supplements, medications, and possibly probiotics.  - Diverticular bleeding is rare. Bleeding can be severe; however, it may stop by itself and not require treatment. If the bleeding does not stop, abdominal surgery with a colon resection may be necessary.  - Diverticulitis with mild symptoms and no complications usually requires a person to rest, take oral antibiotics, and be on a liquid diet for a period of time.  - Diverticulitis can attack suddenly and cause complications, such as an abscess, a perforation, peritonitis, a fistula, or intestinal obstruction. These complications need to be treated to prevent them from getting worse and causing serious illness.",

This is the most accurate way to diagnose abdominal adhesions.\n\nRemember, it's important to consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis.",
        "original_answer": "Abdominal adhesions cannot be detected by tests or seen through imaging techniques such as x rays or ultrasound. Most abdominal adhesions are found during surgery performed to examine the abdomen. However, abdominal x rays, a lower gastrointestinal (GI) series, and computerized tomography (CT) scans can diagnose intestinal obstructions.\n                \n- Abdominal x rays use a small amount of radiation to create an image that is recorded on  film or a computer. An x ray is performed at a hospital or an outpatient center by an x-ray technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologista doctor who specializes in medical imaging. An x ray does not require anesthesia. The person will lie on a table or stand during the x ray. The x-ray machine is positioned over the abdominal area. The person will hold his or her breath as the picture is taken so that the picture will not be blurry. The person may be asked to change position for additional pictures.   - A lower GI series is an x-ray exam that is used to look at the large intestine. The test is performed at a hospital or an outpatient center by an x-ray technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologist. Anesthesia is not needed. The health care provider may provide written bowel prep instructions to follow at home before the test. The person may be asked to follow a clear liquid diet for 1 to 3 days before the procedure. A laxative or an enema may be used before the test. A laxative is medication that loosens stool and increases bowel movements. An enema involves fl ushing water or laxative into the rectum using a special squirt bottle.  For the test, the person will lie on a table while the radiologist inserts a flexible tube into the persons anus. The large intestine is fi lled with barium, making signs of underlying problems show up more clearly on x rays.   - CT scans use a combination of x rays and computer technology to create images. The procedure is performed at a hospital or an outpatient center by an x-ray technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologist. Anesthesia is not needed. A CT scan may include the injection of a special dye, called contrast medium. The person will lie on a table that slides into a tunnel-shaped device where the x rays are taken.",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Abdominal adhesions are fibrous bands that form between abdominal tissues and organs, often as a result of surgery or injury. While it's not always possible to prevent abdominal adhesions, there are steps you can take to reduce the risk:\n\n1. **Proper surgical techniques:** If you're having surgery, choose a skilled surgeon who uses gentle tissue handling and minimally invasive techniques when possible. This can help reduce tissue trauma and the formation of adhesions.\n\n2. **Use of barriers:** In some surgeries, doctors can use surgical barriers to separate tissues and organs, reducing the chance of adhesions forming.\n\n3. **Adequate hydration:** Some studies suggest that good hydration may help prevent adhesions, although more research is needed.\n\n4. **Control inflammation:** Since inflammation can contribute to adhesion formation, controlling inflammation through medications or lifestyle changes may help.\n\n5. **Prevent infections:** Post-operative infections can increase the risk of adhesions, so it's important to follow your doctor's instructions for wound care and take any antibiotics as prescribed.\n\nRemember, while these steps can reduce the risk, they can't eliminate it completely. If you have symptoms of abdominal adhesions, such as chronic pain, bloating, or bowel obstruction, consult with your healthcare provider.",
        "original_answer": "Abdominal adhesions are diffi cult to prevent; however, certain surgical techniques can minimize abdominal adhesions.\n                \nLaparoscopic surgery decreases the potential for abdominal adhesions because several tiny incisions are made in the lower abdomen instead of one large incision. The surgeon inserts a laparoscopea thin tube with a tiny video camera attachedinto one of the small incisions. The camera sends a magnified image from inside the body to a video monitor. Patients will usually receive general anesthesia during this surgery.\n                \nIf laparoscopic surgery is not possible and a large abdominal incision is required, at the end of surgery a special fi lmlike material can be inserted between organs or between the organs and the abdominal incision. The fi lmlike material, which looks similar to wax paper and is absorbed by the body in about a week, hydrates organs to help prevent abdominal adhesions.\n                \nOther steps taken during surgery to reduce abdominal adhesions include\n                \n- using starch- and latex-free gloves  - handling tissues and organs gently  - shortening surgery time   - using moistened drapes and swabs  - occasionally applying saline solution",

If they do cause problems, such as chronic pain or bowel obstruction, surgery may be required. However, it's important to note that surgery can sometimes lead to the formation of new adhesions.\n\nIf you're experiencing symptoms, it's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan. They may recommend medications to manage pain, or in severe cases, surgery to remove the adhesions.\n\nIn the meantime, maintaining a healthy diet, staying hydrated, and engaging in gentle physical activity, as recommended by your doctor, can help alleviate symptoms. It's also important to avoid heavy lifting and strenuous activity, which can exacerbate symptoms.",

        "original_answer": "- Abdominal adhesions are bands of fibrous tissue that can form between abdominal tissues and organs. Abdominal adhesions cause tissues and organs in the abdominal cavity to stick together.  - Abdominal surgery is the most frequent cause of abdominal adhesions. Of patients who undergo abdominal surgery, 93 percent develop abdominal adhesions.  - In most cases, abdominal adhesions do not cause symptoms. When symptoms are present, chronic abdominal pain is the most common.  - A complete intestinal obstruction is life threatening and requires immediate medical attention and often surgery.  - Abdominal adhesions cannot be detected by tests or seen through imaging techniques such as x rays or ultrasound. However, abdominal x rays, a lower gastrointestinal (GI) series, and computerized tomography (CT) scans can diagnose intestinal obstructions.  - Surgery is the only way to treat abdominal adhesions that cause pain, intestinal obstruction, or fertility problems.",

Blood Glucose                     - Check your blood glucose every day.      - Each time you check your blood glucose, write the number in a record book to share with your health care team.      - Treat low blood glucose quickly.            Physical Activity                     - Even small amounts of physical activity help manage diabetes. Aim for 30 to 60 minutes of physical activity most days of the week. Children and adolescents with type 2 diabetes who are 10 to 17 years old should aim for 60 minutes of activity every day.      - Not all physical activity has to take place at the same time.      - Do aerobic activities, such as brisk walking, which use your large muscles to make your heart beat faster. The large muscles are those of the upper and lower arms and legs and those that control head, shoulder, and hip movements.      - Do activities to strengthen muscles and bone, such as lifting weights or sit-ups. Aim for two times a week.      - Stretch to increase your flexibility, lower stress, and help prevent muscle soreness after physical activity.      - Increase daily activity by decreasing time spent watching TV or at the computer. Children and adolescents should limit screen time not related to school to less than 2 hours per day.

Straining during bowel movements\n2. Sitting for long periods of time, especially on the toilet\n3. Chronic constipation or diarrhea\n4. Obesity\n5. Pregnancy\n6. Aging\n7. Anal intercourse\n\nThese factors can cause the veins in the rectum or anus to become swollen and inflamed, leading to the symptoms of hemorrhoids.",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Hello! I'm here to provide general information and guidance, but I cannot diagnose or treat any medical conditions. That said, I can certainly help you understand how hemorrhoids might be diagnosed.\n\nIf you suspect you have hemorrhoids, it's essential to consult a healthcare professional for a proper evaluation. Here are some methods your doctor might use to diagnose hemorrhoids:\n\n1. Medical history: Your doctor will likely begin by asking about your symptoms, medical history, and lifestyle factors, such as diet and bowel habits.\n2. Physical examination: During a physical examination, your doctor may inspect the anal area for any visible signs of hemorrhoids, such as swelling, redness, or protrusions.\n3. Digital rectal exam (DRE): In this procedure, your doctor will gently insert a gloved, lubricated finger into your rectum to check for any abnormalities, such as swollen veins or inflammation.\n4. Visual inspection: To get a better view of the anal canal and rectum, your doctor may use an anoscope, a short, lighted tube that provides a magnified view of the area. In some cases, a proctoscope or sigmoidoscope may be used for a more extensive examination.\n\nRemember, it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment. If you have any concerns about your symptoms, please consult a medical professional as soon as possible.",
        "original_answer": "The doctor will examine the anus and rectum to determine whether a person has hemorrhoids. Hemorrhoid symptoms are similar to the symptoms of other anorectal problems, such as fissures, abscesses, warts, and polyps.\n                \nThe doctor will perform a physical exam to look for visible hemorrhoids. A digital rectal exam with a gloved, lubricated finger and an anoscopea hollow, lighted tubemay be performed to view the rectum.\n                \nA thorough evaluation and proper diagnosis by a doctor is important any time a person notices bleeding from the rectum or blood in the stool. Bleeding may be a symptom of other digestive diseases, including colorectal cancer.\n                \nAdditional exams may be done to rule out other causes of bleeding, especially in people age 40 or older:\n                \n- Colonoscopy. A flexible, lighted tube called a colonoscope is inserted through the anus, the rectum, and the upper part of the large intestine, called the colon. The colonoscope transmits images of the inside of the rectum and the entire colon.  - Sigmoidoscopy. This procedure is similar to colonoscopy, but it uses a shorter tube called a sigmoidoscope and transmits images of the rectum and the sigmoid colon, the lower portion of the colon that empties into the rectum.  - Barium enema x ray. A contrast material called barium is inserted into the colon to make the colon more visible in x ray pictures.",

        "original_answer": "At-home Treatments\n                \nSimple diet and lifestyle changes often reduce the swelling of hemorrhoids and relieve hemorrhoid symptoms. Eating a high-fiber diet can make stools softer and easier to pass, reducing the pressure on hemorrhoids caused by straining.\n                \nFiber is a substance found in plants. The human body cannot digest fiber, but fiber helps improve digestion and prevent constipation. Good sources of dietary fiber are fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. On average, Americans eat about 15 grams of fiber each day.3 The American Dietetic Association recommends 25 grams of fiber per day for women and 38 grams of fiber per day for men.3\n                \nDoctors may also suggest taking a bulk stool softener or a fiber supplement such as psyllium (Metamucil) or methylcellulose (Citrucel).\n                \nOther changes that may help relieve hemorrhoid symptoms include\n                \n- drinking six to eight 8-ounce glasses of water or other nonalcoholic fluids each day  - sitting in a tub of warm water for 10 minutes several times a day  - exercising to prevent constipation  - not straining during bowel movements\n                \nOver-the-counter creams and suppositories may temporarily relieve the pain and itching of hemorrhoids. These treatments should only be used for a short time because long-term use can damage the skin.\n                \nMedical Treatment\n                \nIf at-home treatments do not relieve symptoms, medical treatments may be needed. Outpatient treatments can be performed in a doctor's office or a hospital. Outpatient treatments for internal hemorrhoids include the following:\n                \n- Rubber band ligation. The doctor places a special rubber band around the base of the hemorrhoid. The band cuts off circulation, causing the hemorrhoid to shrink. This procedure should be performed only by a doctor.  - Sclerotherapy. The doctor injects a chemical solution into the blood vessel to shrink the hemorrhoid.  - Infrared coagulation. The doctor uses heat to shrink the hemorrhoid tissue.\n                \nLarge external hemorrhoids or internal hemorrhoids that do not respond to other treatments can be surgically removed.",

They will also ask about any history of intestinal surgery or disease.\n2. Physical Examination: The doctor will perform a physical exam to check for signs of dehydration, malnutrition, or other complications of SBS.\n3. Diagnostic Tests: The following tests may be ordered to confirm the diagnosis of SBS:\n* Blood tests: To check for signs of malnutrition, dehydration, and electrolyte imbalances.\n* Stool tests: To check for infection or inflammation in the digestive tract.\n* Imaging tests: Such as X-rays, CT scans, or MRIs, to evaluate the structure and function of the intestines.\n* Video Capsule Endoscopy: A small camera pill is swallowed, which takes pictures of the digestive tract as it passes through.\n* Small Bowel Follow-Through: A series of X-rays are taken after the patient drinks a contrast material, to evaluate the small intestine.\n\nBased on the results of these tests, the doctor can determine if the patient has SBS and the extent of the damage to the intestines. The severity of SBS is usually classified as mild, moderate, or severe, based on the length of the remaining small intestine and the patient's symptoms.",
        "original_answer": "A health care provider diagnoses short bowel syndrome based on\n                \n- a medical and family history  - a physical exam  - blood tests  - fecal fat tests  - an x-ray of the small and large intestines  - upper gastrointestinal (GI) series  - computerized tomography (CT) scan\n                \nMedical and Family History\n                \nTaking a medical and family history may help a health care provider diagnose short bowel syndrome. He or she will ask the patient about symptoms and may request a history of past operations.\n                \nPhysical Exam\n                \nA physical exam may help diagnose short bowel syndrome. During a physical exam, a health care provider usually\n                \n- examines a patient's body, looking for muscle wasting or weight loss and signs of vitamin and mineral deficiencies  - uses a stethoscope to listen to sounds in the abdomen  - taps on specific areas of the patient's body\n                \nBlood Tests\n                \nA blood test involves drawing a patient's blood at a health care provider's office or a commercial facility and sending the sample to a lab for analysis. Blood tests can show mineral and vitamin levels and measure complete blood count.\n                \nFecal Fat Tests\n                \nA fecal fat test measures the body's ability to break down and absorb fat. For this test, a patient provides a stool sample at a health care provider's office. The patient may also use a take-home test kit. The patient collects stool in plastic wrap that he or she lays over the toilet seat and places a sample into a container. A patient can also use a special tissue provided by the health care provider's office to collect the sample and place the tissue into the container. For children wearing diapers, the parent or caretaker can line the diaper with plastic to collect the stool. The health care provider will send the sample to a lab for analysis. A fecal fat test can show how well the small intestine is working.\n                \nX-ray\n                \nAn x-ray is a picture created by using radiation and recorded on film or on a computer. The amount of radiation used is small. An x-ray technician performs the x-ray at a hospital or an outpatient center, and a radiologista doctor who specializes in medical imaginginterprets the images. An x-ray of the small intestine can show that the last segment of the large intestine is narrower than normal. Blocked stool causes the part of the intestine just before this narrow segment to stretch and bulge.\n                \nUpper Gastrointestinal Series\n                \nUpper GI series, also called a barium swallow, uses x rays and fluoroscopy to help diagnose problems of the upper GI tract. Fluoroscopy is a form of x ray that makes it possible to see the internal organs and their motion on a video monitor. An x-ray technician performs this test at a hospital or an outpatient center, and a radiologist interprets the images.\n                \nDuring the procedure, the patient will stand or sit in front of an x-ray machine and drink barium, a chalky liquid. Barium coats the esophagus, stomach, and small intestine so the radiologist and a health care provider can see the shape of these organs more clearly on x-rays.\n                \nA patient may experience bloating and nausea for a short time after the test. For several days afterward, barium liquid in the GI tract causes white or light-colored stools. A health care provider will give the patient specific instructions about eating and drinking after the test. Upper GI series can show narrowing and widening of the small and large intestines.\n                \nMore information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Upper GI Series.\n                \nComputerized Tomography Scan\n                \nComputerized tomography scans use a combination of x-rays and computer technology to create images. For a CT scan, a health care provider may give the patient a solution to drink and an injection of a special dye, called a contrast medium. CT scans require the patient to lie on a table that slides into a tunnel-shaped device that takes x-rays.\n                \nAn x-ray technician performs the procedure in an outpatient center or a hospital, and a radiologist interprets the images. The patient does not need anesthesia. CT scans can show bowel obstruction and changes in the intestines.",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Treatment for Short Bowel Syndrome (SBS) typically involves a combination of nutritional support, medication, and, in some cases, surgery.\n\n1. Nutritional Support: This is the primary treatment for SBS. It often includes oral rehydration solutions, dietary modifications, and enteral nutrition (tube feeding). In severe cases, total parenteral nutrition (TPN) may be necessary, which involves delivering nutrients directly into the bloodstream through a vein.\n\n2. Medication: Certain medications can help manage symptoms and complications of SBS. These include anti-diarrheal drugs, H2 blockers or proton pump inhibitors to reduce stomach acid, and medications to treat or prevent bacterial overgrowth in the small intestine.\n\n3. Surgery: In some cases, surgery may be necessary to improve nutrient absorption or to treat complications. This could include procedures to lengthen the remaining intestine, create an intestinal reservoir, or even transplant a portion of the small intestine.\n\nIt's important to note that treatment is highly individualized and depends on the severity of the condition, the underlying cause, and the patient's overall health. Regular follow-up with a healthcare provider is essential to manage this complex condition.",
        "original_answer": "A health care provider will recommend treatment for short bowel syndrome based on a patient's nutritional needs. Treatment may include\n                \n- nutritional support  - medications  - surgery  - intestinal transplant\n                \nNutritional Support\n                \nThe main treatment for short bowel syndrome is nutritional support, which may include the following:\n                \n- Oral rehydration. Adults should drink water, sports drinks, sodas without caffeine, and salty broths. Children should drink oral rehydration solutionsspecial drinks that contain salts and minerals to prevent dehydrationsuch as Pedialyte, Naturalyte, Infalyte, and CeraLyte, which are sold in most grocery stores and drugstores.  - Parenteral nutrition. This treatment delivers fluids, electrolytes, and liquid vitamins and minerals into the bloodstream through an intravenous (IV) tubea tube placed into a vein. Health care providers give parenteral nutrition to people who cannot or should not get their nutrition or enough fluids through eating.  - Enteral nutrition. This treatment delivers liquid food to the stomach or small intestine through a feeding tubea small, soft, plastic tube placed through the nose or mouth into the stomach. Gallstonessmall, pebblelike substances that develop in the gallbladderare a complication of enteral nutrition. More information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Gallstones.  - Vitamin and mineral supplements. A person may need to take vitamin and mineral supplements during or after parenteral or enteral nutrition.  - Special diet. A health care provider can recommend a specific diet plan for the patient that may include      - small, frequent feedings    - avoiding foods that can cause diarrhea, such as foods high in sugar, protein, and fiber    - avoiding high-fat foods\n                \nMedications\n                \nA health care provider may prescribe medications to treat short bowel syndrome, including\n                \n- antibiotics to prevent bacterial overgrowth  - H2 blockers to treat too much gastric acid secretion  - proton pump inhibitors to treat too much gastric acid secretion  - choleretic agents to improve bile flow and prevent liver disease  - bile-salt binders to decrease diarrhea  - anti-secretin agents to reduce gastric acid in the intestine  - hypomotility agents to increase the time it takes food to travel through the intestines, leading to increased nutrient absorption  - growth hormones to improve intestinal absorption  - teduglutide to improve intestinal absorption\n                \nSurgery\n                \nThe goal of surgery is to increase the small intestine's ability to absorb nutrients. Approximately half of the patients with short bowel syndrome need surgery.2 Surgery used to treat short bowel syndrome includes procedures that\n                \n- prevent blockage and preserve the length of the small intestine  - narrow any dilated segment of the small intestine  - slow the time it takes for food to travel through the small intestine  - lengthen the small intestine\n                \nLong-term treatment and recovery, which for some may take years, depend in part on\n                \n- what sections of the small intestine were removed  - how much of the intestine is damaged  - how well the muscles of the intestine work  - how well the remaining small intestine adapts over time\n                \nIntestinal Transplant\n                \nAn intestinal transplant is surgery to remove a diseased or an injured small intestine and replace it with a healthy small intestine from a person who has just died, called a donor. Sometimes a living donor can provide a segment of his or her small intestine.\n                \nTransplant surgeonsdoctors who specialize in performing transplant surgeryperform the surgery on patients for whom other treatments have failed and who have lifethreatening complications from long-term parenteral nutrition. An intestinal-transplant team performs the surgery in a hospital. The patient will need anesthesia. Complications of intestinal transplantation include infections and rejection of the transplanted organ.\n                \nA successful intestinal transplant can be a life-saving treatment for people with intestinal failure caused by short bowel syndrome. By 2008, transplant surgeons had performed almost 2,000 intestinal transplantations in the United Statesapproximately 75 percent of which were in patients younger than 18 years of age.3\n                \nA health care provider will tailor treatment to the severity of the patient's disease:   - Treatment for mild short bowel syndrome involves eating small, frequent meals; drinking fluid; taking nutritional supplements; and using medications to treat diarrhea.   - Treatment for moderate short bowel syndrome is similar to that for mild short bowel syndrome, with the addition of parenteral nutrition as needed.   - Treatment for severe short bowel syndrome involves use of parenteral nutrition and oral rehydration solutions. Patients may receive enteral nutrition or continue normal eating, even though most of the nutrients are not absorbed. Both enteral nutrition and normal eating stimulate the remaining intestine to work better and may allow patients to discontinue parenteral nutrition. Some patients with severe short bowel syndrome require parenteral nutrition indefinitely or surgery.",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome (ZES) is typically diagnosed through a series of tests and exams. Here are the general steps:\n\n1. Medical history and physical exam: The doctor will first review your symptoms, medical history, and family history. A physical exam will also be performed.\n2. Blood tests: These can be used to check for high levels of gastrin, a hormone that stimulates the stomach to produce acid. In ZES, tumors in the pancreas or duodenum cause the stomach to produce too much gastrin.\n3. Imaging tests: These can help locate tumors in the pancreas or duodenum. They may include a CT scan, MRI, or an endoscopic ultrasound.\n4. Upper endoscopy (EGD): This is a procedure where a thin, flexible tube with a camera is inserted through the mouth and into the stomach and small intestine. This allows the doctor to see if there are any abnormal growths or ulcers.\n5. Gastrin provocation test: This test is used to confirm the diagnosis of ZES. It involves giving the patient a medication that stimulates the release of gastrin, and then measuring gastrin levels in the blood.\n6. Secretin stimulation test: This test involves injecting a hormone called secretin and then measuring the patient's gastrin levels. In ZES, gastrin levels will increase significantly after the injection.\n\nIf ZES is diagnosed, further tests will be needed to determine the location and extent of the tumors, as well as whether the tumors have spread to other parts of the body.",
        "original_answer": "A health care provider diagnoses Zollinger-Ellison syndrome based on the following:\n                \n- medical history   - physical exam  - signs and symptoms  - blood tests  - upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy  - imaging tests to look for gastrinomas  - measurement of stomach acid\n                \nMedical History\n                \nTaking a medical and family history is one of the first things a health care provider may do to help diagnose Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. The health care provider may ask about family cases of MEN1 in particular.\n                \nPhysical Exam\n                \nA physical exam may help diagnose Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. During a physical exam, a health care provider usually\n                \n- examines a persons body  - uses a stethoscope to listen to bodily sounds  - taps on specific areas of the persons body\n                \nSigns and Symptoms\n                \nA health care provider may suspect Zollinger-Ellison syndrome if\n                \n- diarrhea accompanies peptic ulcer symptoms or if peptic ulcer treatment fails.  - a person has peptic ulcers without the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as aspirin and ibuprofen or a bacterial Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection. NSAID use and H. pylori infection may cause peptic ulcers.  - a person has severe ulcers that bleed or cause holes in the duodenum or stomach.  - a health care provider diagnoses a person or the persons family member with MEN1 or a person has symptoms of MEN1.\n                \nBlood Tests\n                \nThe health care provider may use blood tests to check for an elevated gastrin level. A technician or nurse draws a blood sample during an office visit or at a commercial facility and sends the sample to a lab for analysis. A health care provider will ask the person to fast for several hours prior to the test and may ask the person to stop acid-reducing medications for a period of time before the test. A gastrin level that is 10 times higher than normal suggests Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.2\n                \nA health care provider may also check for an elevated gastrin level after an infusion of secretin. Secretin is a hormone that causes gastrinomas to release more gastrin. A technician or nurse places an intravenous (IV) needle in a vein in the arm to give an infusion of secretin. A health care provider may suspect Zollinger-Ellison syndrome if blood drawn after the infusion shows an elevated gastrin level.\n                \nUpper Gastrointestinal Endoscopy\n                \nThe health care provider uses an upper GI endoscopy to check the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum for ulcers and esophagitisa general term used to describe irritation and swelling of the esophagus. This procedure involves using an endoscopea small, flexible tube with a lightto see the upper GI tract, which includes the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. A gastroenterologista doctor who specializes in digestive diseasesperforms the test at a hospital or an outpatient center. The gastroenterologist carefully feeds the endoscope down the esophagus and into the stomach and duodenum. A small camera mounted on the endoscope transmits a video image to a monitor, allowing close examination of the intestinal lining. A person may receive a liquid anesthetic that is gargled or sprayed on the back of the throat. A technician or nurse inserts an IV needle in a vein in the arm if anesthesia is given.\n                \nImaging Tests\n                \nTo help find gastrinomas, a health care provider may order one or more of the following imaging tests:\n                \n- Computerized tomography (CT) scan. A CT scan is an x ray that produces pictures of the body. A CT scan may include the injection of a special dye, called contrast medium. CT scans use a combination of x rays and computer technology to create images. CT scans require the person to lie on a table that slides into a tunnel-shaped device where an x-ray technician takes x rays. A computer puts the different views together to create a model of the pancreas, stomach, and duodenum. The x-ray technician performs the procedure in an outpatient center or a hospital, and a radiologista doctor who specializes in medical imaginginterprets the images. The person does not need anesthesia. CT scans can show tumors and ulcers.  - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI is a test that takes pictures of the bodys internal organs and soft tissues without using x rays. A specially trained technician performs the procedure in an outpatient center or a hospital, and a radiologist interprets the images. The person does not need anesthesia, though people with a fear of confined spaces may receive light sedation, taken by mouth. An MRI may include the injection of contrast medium. With most MRI machines, the person will lie on a table that slides into a tunnel-shaped device that may be open ended or closed at one end. Some machines allow the person to lie in a more open space. During an MRI, the person, although usually awake, remains perfectly still while the technician takes the images, which usually takes only a few minutes. The technician will take a sequence of images from different angles to create a detailed picture of the upper GI tract. During sequencing, the person will hear loud mechanical knocking and humming noises.  - Endoscopic ultrasound. This procedure involves using a special endoscope called an endoechoscope to perform ultrasound of the pancreas. The endoechoscope has a built-in miniature ultrasound probe that bounces safe, painless sound waves off organs to create an image of their structure. A gastroenterologist performs the procedure in an outpatient center or a hospital, and a radiologist interprets the images. The gastroenterologist carefully feeds the endoechoscope down the esophagus, through the stomach and duodenum, until it is near the pancreas. A person may receive a liquid anesthetic that is gargled or sprayed on the back of the throat. A sedative helps the person stay relaxed and comfortable. The images can show gastrinomas in the pancreas.  - Angiogram. An angiogram is a special kind of x ray in which an interventional radiologista specially trained radiologistthreads a thin, flexible tube called a catheter through the large arteries, often from the groin, to the artery of interest. The radiologist injects contrast medium through the catheter so the images show up more clearly on the x ray. The interventional radiologist performs the procedure and interprets the images in a hospital or an outpatient center. A person does not need anesthesia, though a light sedative may help reduce a persons anxiety during the procedure. This test can show gastrinomas in the pancreas.  - Somatostatin receptor scintigraphy. An x-ray technician performs this test, also called OctreoScan, at a hospital or an outpatient center, and a radiologist interprets the images. A person does not need anesthesia. A radioactive compound called a radiotracer, when injected into the bloodstream, selectively labels tumor cells. The labeled cells light up when scanned with a device called a gamma camera. The test can show gastrinomas in the duodenum, pancreas, and other parts of the body.\n                \nSmall gastrinomas may be hard to see; therefore, health care providers may order several types of imaging tests to find gastrinomas.\n                \nStomach-acid Measurement\n                \nUsing a sample of stomach juices for analysis, a health care provider may measure the amount of stomach acid a person produces. During the exam, a health care provider puts in a nasogastric tubea tiny tube inserted through the nose and throat that reaches into the stomach. A person may receive a liquid anesthetic that is gargled or sprayed on the back of the throat. Once the tube is placed, a health care provider takes samples of the stomach acid. High acid levels in the stomach indicate Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome (ZES) is a rare condition where tumors in the pancreas or duodenum produce excessive amounts of gastrin, leading to severe gastric acid production. Here are the common treatments:\n\n1. **Medication:** Initial treatment usually involves high doses of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) to control acid production. These drugs include omeprazole, lansoprazole, and pantoprazole, among others.\n\n2. **Surgery:** If the tumors are benign (non-cancerous) and can be located, they may be surgically removed. This is often the case in sporadic ZES, where there is a single tumor.\n\n3. **Chemoembolization or Radiofrequency Ablation:** These are minimally invasive procedures used to treat tumors (usually in the liver) that can't be removed surgically. Chemoembolization delivers chemotherapy drugs directly to the tumor, while radiofrequency ablation uses heat to destroy the tumor.\n\n4. **Targeted Therapy or Chemotherapy:** If the tumors are malignant (cancerous) and have spread, more aggressive treatments like targeted therapy or chemotherapy may be used. These treatments aim to slow or stop the growth of the tumors.\n\n5. **Peptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy (PRRT):** This is a type of treatment for neuroendocrine tumors that can't be removed surgically. It involves injecting a radioactive substance that targets the tumor cells, helping to shrink them.\n\nRemember, the best treatment plan depends on the individual's specific circumstances, including the size and location of the tumors, whether they are benign or malignant, and the patient's overall health. It's important to discuss these options with a healthcare provider.",
        "original_answer": "A health care provider treats Zollinger-Ellison syndrome with medications to reduce gastric acid secretion and with surgery to remove gastrinomas.

A health care provider may prescribe people who have Zollinger-Ellison syndrome higher-than-normal doses of PPIs to control the acid production. Studies show that PPIs may increase the risk of hip, wrist, and spine fractures when a person takes them long term or in high doses, so its important for people to discuss risks versus benefits with their health care provider.\n                \nSurgery\n                \nSurgical removal of gastrinomas is the only cure for Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.

While ACKD itself is not harmful, it can lead to several complications:\n\n1. Kidney function decline: ACKD can lead to a further decline in kidney function, potentially resulting in kidney failure.\n\n2. Cyst infections: The cysts in the kidneys can become infected, causing pain, fever, and other symptoms.\n\n3. Cyst rupture: A cyst may rupture, causing pain and bleeding in the kidney.\n\n4. High blood pressure: ACKD can contribute to the development of high blood pressure, which can further damage the kidneys.\n\n5. Kidney stones: People with ACKD are at a higher risk of developing kidney stones due to the presence of cysts.\n\n6. Anemia: ACKD can lead to a decrease in erythropoietin, a hormone produced by the kidneys that stimulates the production of red blood cells, leading to anemia.\n\nIt is important to note that not everyone with ACKD will experience these complications, and regular monitoring and management of the condition can help prevent or minimize them.",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Acquired Cystic Kidney Disease (ACKD) is typically diagnosed through a combination of medical history, physical examination, and imaging tests such as ultrasound, CT scan, or MRI. These imaging tests can help to detect and count the number of cysts in the kidneys. In some cases, additional tests such as blood tests and urine tests may be done to assess kidney function and check for any associated complications. ACKD is usually found in patients with chronic kidney disease, especially those who have been on dialysis for a long time. If you have concerns about ACKD, I recommend consulting with a healthcare professional for a proper evaluation.",
        "original_answer": "A health care provider may diagnose a person with acquired cystic kidney disease based on\n                \n- medical history  - imaging tests\n                \nMedical History\n                \nTaking a medical history may help a health care provider diagnose acquired cystic kidney disease. A health care provider may suspect acquired cystic kidney disease if a person who has been on dialysis for several years develops symptoms such as fever, back pain, or blood in the urine.\n                \nImaging Tests\n                \nTo confirm the diagnosis, the health care provider may order one or more imaging tests. A radiologista doctor who specializes in medical imaginginterprets the images from these tests, and the patient does not need anesthesia.\n                \n- Ultrasound uses a device, called a transducer, that bounces safe, painless sound waves off organs to create an image of their structure. A specially trained technician performs the procedure in a health care provider's office, an outpatient center, or a hospital. The images can show cysts in the kidneys as well as the kidneys' size and shape.  - Computerized tomography (CT) scans use a combination of x rays and computer technology to create images. For a CT scan, a nurse or technician may give the patient a solution to drink and an injection of a special dye, called contrast medium. CT scans require the patient to lie on a table that slides into a tunnel-shaped device where an x-ray technician takes the x-rays. An x-ray technician performs the procedure in an outpatient center or a hospital. CT scans can show cysts and tumors in the kidneys.  - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a test that takes pictures of the body's internal organs and soft tissues without using x-rays. A specially trained technician performs the procedure in an outpatient center or a hospital. Although the patient does not need anesthesia, a health care provider may give people with a fear of confined spaces light sedation, taken by mouth. An MRI may include the injection of contrast medium. With most MRI machines, the patient will lie on a table that slides into a tunnel-shaped device that may be open-ended or closed at one end. Some machines allow the patient to lie in a more open space. During an MRI, the patient, although usually awake, must remain perfectly still while the technician takes the images, which usually takes only a few minutes. The technician will take a sequence of images from different angles to create a detailed picture of the kidneys. During the test, the patient will hear loud mechanical knocking and humming noises from the machine.\n                \nSometimes a health care provider may discover acquired cystic kidney disease during an imaging exam for another condition. Images of the kidneys may help the health care provider distinguish acquired cystic kidney disease from PKD.",

The treatment for ACKD typically focuses on managing the underlying kidney disease and any complications that arise from the cysts.\n\nSome common treatments for ACKD include:\n\n1. Medication: Pain relievers, antibiotics, or other medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or complications associated with ACKD.\n2. Drainage: If a cyst becomes large enough to cause discomfort or other problems, it may be necessary to drain it using a needle.\n3. Surgery: In some cases, surgery may be required to remove cysts that are causing significant complications.\n4. Dialysis: If the kidneys fail completely, dialysis may be necessary to remove waste and excess fluid from the body.\n5. Kidney transplant: In severe cases of ACKD, a kidney transplant may be necessary.\n\nIt is important to note that there is no cure for ACKD, and treatment is focused on managing symptoms and preventing complications.

Greasy or spicy foods\n3. Carbonated drinks\n4. Alcohol, caffeine, or tobacco\n5. Stress or anxiety\n6. Certain medications, such as antibiotics or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)\n7. Medical conditions such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), gastritis, ulcers, or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)\n\nIf you experience indigestion frequently, it is important to speak with a healthcare professional to determine the underlying cause and develop an appropriate treatment plan.",
        "original_answer": "Indigestion can be caused by a condition in the digestive tract such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), peptic ulcer disease, cancer, or abnormality of the pancreas or bile ducts. If the condition improves or resolves, the symptoms of indigestion usually improve.\n                \nSometimes a person has indigestion for which a cause cannot be found. This type of indigestion, called functional dyspepsia, is thought to occur in the area where the stomach meets the small intestine. The indigestion may be related to abnormal motilitythe squeezing or relaxing actionof the stomach muscle as it receives, digests, and moves food into the small intestine.",

If the doctor suspects a more serious underlying condition, they may recommend additional testing such as:\n\n* Blood tests\n* Stool tests\n* Imaging tests (such as an X-ray or CT scan)\n* Upper endoscopy (a procedure in which a thin, flexible tube with a camera is inserted into the mouth to examine the esophagus, stomach, and small intestine)\n\nIt's important to seek medical attention if you experience severe or persistent symptoms of indigestion, as they could be a sign of a more serious underlying condition.",
        "original_answer": "To diagnose indigestion, the doctor asks about the person's current symptoms and medical history and performs a physical examination. The doctor may order x rays of the stomach and small intestine.\n                \nThe doctor may perform blood, breath, or stool tests if the type of bacteria that causes peptic ulcer disease is suspected as the cause of indigestion.\n                \nThe doctor may perform an upper endoscopy.

However, it's important to consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan.",
        "original_answer": "Some people may experience relief from symptoms of indigestion by\n                \n- eating several small, low-fat meals throughout the day at a slow pace  - refraining from smoking  - abstaining from consuming coffee, carbonated beverages, and alcohol  - stopping use of medications that may irritate the stomach liningsuch as aspirin or anti-inflammatory drugs  - getting enough rest  - finding ways to decrease emotional and physical stress, such as relaxation therapy or yoga\n                \nThe doctor may recommend over-the-counter antacids or medications that reduce acid production or help the stomach move food more quickly into the small intestine. Many of these medications can be purchased without a prescription. Nonprescription medications should only be used at the dose and for the length of time recommended on the label unless advised differently by a doctor. Informing the doctor when starting a new medication is important.\n                \nAntacids, such as Alka-Seltzer, Maalox, Mylanta, Rolaids, and Riopan, are usually the first drugs recommended to relieve symptoms of indigestion. Many brands on the market use different combinations of three basic saltsmagnesium, calcium, and aluminumwith hydroxide or bicarbonate ions to neutralize the acid in the stomach. Antacids, however, can have side effects. Magnesium salt can lead to diarrhea, and aluminum salt may cause constipation. Aluminum and magnesium salts are often combined in a single product to balance these effects.\n                \nCalcium carbonate antacids, such as Tums, Titralac, and Alka-2, can also be a supplemental source of calcium, though they may cause constipation.\n                \nH2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs) include ranitidine (Zantac), cimetidine (Tagamet), famotidine (Pepcid), and nizatidine (Axid) and are available both by prescription and over-the-counter. H2RAs treat symptoms of indigestion by reducing stomach acid. They work longer than but not as quickly as antacids. Side effects of H2RAs may include headache, nausea, vomiting, constipation, diarrhea, and unusual bleeding or bruising.\n                \nProton pump inhibitors (PPIs) include omeprazole (Prilosec, Zegerid), lansoprazole (Prevacid), pantoprazole (Protonix), rabeprazole (Aciphex), and esomeprazole (Nexium) and are available by prescription. Prilosec is also available in over-the-counter strength. PPIs, which are stronger than H2RAs, also treat indigestion symptoms by reducing stomach acid. PPIs are most effective in treating symptoms of indigestion in people who also have GERD. Side effects of PPIs may include back pain, aching, cough, headache, dizziness, abdominal pain, gas, nausea, vomiting, constipation, and diarrhea.\n                \nProkinetics such as metoclopramide (Reglan) may be helpful for people who have a problem with the stomach emptying too slowly. Metoclopramide also improves muscle action in the digestive tract. Prokinetics have frequent side effects that limit their usefulness, including fatigue, sleepiness, depression, anxiety, and involuntary muscle spasms or movements.\n                \nIf testing shows the type of bacteria that causes peptic ulcer disease, the doctor may prescribe antibiotics to treat the condition.",

If you're experiencing indigestion, here are some things you can try:\n\n1. **Eat smaller, more frequent meals:** Instead of three large meals, try consuming several smaller meals throughout the day. This can help reduce the amount of food in your stomach at any given time, easing the symptoms of indigestion.\n\n2. **Avoid trigger foods:** Certain foods and drinks can trigger indigestion, such as fatty or fried foods, spicy dishes, citrus fruits, tomato-based products, chocolate, caffeine, carbonated drinks, and alcohol. Try to identify your personal triggers and limit your intake of them.\n\n3. **Don't lie down after eating:** Wait at least three hours after eating before lying down or going to bed. This can help prevent acid reflux, a common cause of indigestion.\n\n4. **Manage stress:** High stress levels can exacerbate indigestion. Try practicing relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing, meditation, or yoga, to help manage stress and improve digestion.\n\n5. **Over-the-counter medications:** Antacids, histamine-2 blockers, or proton pump inhibitors can help relieve indigestion symptoms.

You will need to see an ophthalmologist who can decide whether you need one of these treatments:\n                \n- Medicines. Your doctor treats macular edema with injections of medicines into the eye. These medicines block a protein in the body that causes abnormal blood vessel growth and fluid leakage. Reducing the fluid leakage often allows the retina to return to normal thickness. The ophthalmologist will numb your eye and then insert a tiny needle to deliver the medicine.  - Laser treatment. Your doctor can also treat macular edema with focal laser treatment. In one visit, the ophthalmologist will numb your eye and place many small laser burns in the areas leaking fluid near the macula. These burns slow the leakage of fluid and reduce the amount of fluid in your retina.  Sometimes your doctor also treats diabetic retinopathy with scatter laser treatment. In two or more visits, the ophthalmologist will numb your eye and place thousands of laser burns around the new, weak blood vessels away from the macula, causing them to shrink.  Laser treatment can greatly reduce your chances of blindness from retina damage. However, laser treatment often cannot restore vision that has already been lost.  Treatment with medicines or lasers can be performed in your ophthalmologists office.  - Vitrectomy. If the bleeding in your eye is severe, you may need to go to the hospital for a surgery called a vitrectomy. Your ophthalmologist will numb your eye or give you general anesthesia to help you fall asleep. The ophthalmologist will make a tiny cut in your eye and remove the vitreous gel that is clouded with blood. The ophthalmologist replaces the vitreous gel with a salt solution.",

Other medical conditions: Diarrhea can also be a symptom of other medical conditions, such as diabetes, hyperthyroidism, or pancreatitis.\n\nIf you are experiencing diarrhea that lasts for more than a few days, or if you have other symptoms such as fever, abdominal pain, or blood in your stools, it is important to seek medical attention.",
        "original_answer": "Acute diarrhea is usually caused by a bacterial, viral, or parasitic infection. Chronic diarrhea is usually related to a functional disorder such as irritable bowel syndrome or an intestinal disease such as Crohns disease.\n                \nThe most common causes of diarrhea include the following:\n                \n- Bacterial infections. Several types of bacteria consumed through contaminated food or water can cause diarrhea. Common culprits include Campylobacter, Salmonella, Shigella, and Escherichia coli (E. coli).  - Viral infections. Many viruses cause diarrhea, including rotavirus, norovirus, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, and viral hepatitis. Infection with the rotavirus is the most common cause of acute diarrhea in children. Rotavirus diarrhea usually resolves in 3 to 7 days but can cause problems digesting lactose for up to a month or longer.  - Parasites. Parasites can enter the body through food or water and settle in the digestive system. Parasites that cause diarrhea include Giardia lamblia, Entamoeba histolytica, and Cryptosporidium.  - Functional bowel disorders. Diarrhea can be a symptom of irritable bowel syndrome.  - Intestinal diseases. Inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative colitis, Crohns disease, and celiac disease often lead to diarrhea.  - Food intolerances and sensitivities. Some people have difficulty digesting certain ingredients, such as lactose, the sugar found in milk and milk products. Some people may have diarrhea if they eat certain types of sugar substitutes in excessive quantities.  - Reaction to medicines. Antibiotics, cancer drugs, and antacids containing magnesium can all cause diarrhea.\n                \nSome people develop diarrhea after stomach surgery, which may cause food to move through the digestive system more quickly.\n                \nPeople who visit certain foreign countries are at risk for travelers diarrhea, which is caused by eating food or drinking water contaminated with bacteria, viruses, or parasites. Travelers diarrhea can be a problem for people traveling to developing countries in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean. Visitors to Canada, most European countries, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand do not face much risk for travelers diarrhea.\n                \nIn many cases, the cause of diarrhea cannot be found. As long as diarrhea goes away on its own within 1 to 2 days, finding the cause is not usually necessary.",

Some infections that cause diarrhea can also cause a fever and chills or bloody stools.\n                \nDehydration\n                \nDiarrhea can cause dehydration. Loss of electrolytes through dehydration affects the amount of water in the body, muscle activity, and other important functions.\n                \nDehydration is particularly dangerous in children, older adults, and people with weakened immune systems. Dehydration must be treated promptly to avoid serious health problems, such as organ damage, shock, or comaa sleeplike state in which a person is not conscious.\n                \nSigns of dehydration in adults include\n                \n- thirst  - less frequent urination than usual  - dark-colored urine  - dry skin  - fatigue  - dizziness  - light-headedness\n                \nSigns of dehydration in infants and young children include\n                \n- dry mouth and tongue  - no tears when crying  - no wet diapers for 3 hours or more  - sunken eyes, cheeks, or soft spot in the skull  - high fever  - listlessness or irritability\n                \nAlso, when people are dehydrated, their skin does not flatten back to normal right away after being gently pinched and released.\n                \nAnyone with signs of dehydration should see a health care provider immediately. Severe dehydration may require hospitalization.\n                \nAlthough drinking plenty of water is important in preventing dehydration, water does not contain electrolytes. Adults can prevent dehydration by also drinking liquids that contain electrolytes, such as fruit juices, sports drinks, caffeine-free soft drinks, and broths. Children with diarrhea should be given oral rehydration solutions such as Pedialyte, Naturalyte, Infalyte, and CeraLyte to prevent dehydration.",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Diagnosing diarrhea typically involves a combination of discussing your symptoms and medical history with your doctor, as well as undergoing a physical examination. In some cases, additional tests such as stool tests, blood tests, or imaging tests may be required to determine the underlying cause of the diarrhea.\n\nDuring a stool test, a sample of your stool is analyzed in a laboratory to look for signs of infection, inflammation, or other abnormalities. Blood tests can be used to check for signs of infection, inflammation, or malnutrition. Imaging tests, such as X-rays or CT scans, may be ordered if your doctor suspects a structural abnormality or obstruction in your digestive tract.\n\nIt's important to note that diarrhea can be a symptom of many different medical conditions, ranging from viral or bacterial infections to chronic conditions like inflammatory bowel disease or irritable bowel syndrome. As such, it's important to seek medical attention if you are experiencing persistent or severe diarrhea, as early diagnosis and treatment can help prevent complications and improve outcomes.",
        "original_answer": "If acute diarrhea lasts 2 days or less, diagnostic tests are usually not necessary. If diarrhea lasts longer or is accompanied by symptoms such as fever or bloody stools, a doctor may perform tests to determine the cause.\n                \nDiagnostic tests to find the cause of diarrhea may include the following:\n                \n- Medical history and physical examination. The doctor will ask about eating habits and medication use and will perform a physical examination to look for signs of illness.  - Stool culture. A sample of stool is analyzed in a laboratory to check for bacteria, parasites, or other signs of disease and infection.  - Blood tests. Blood tests can be helpful in ruling out certain diseases.  - Fasting tests. To find out if a food intolerance or allergy is causing the diarrhea, the doctor may ask a person to avoid foods with lactose, carbohydrates, wheat, or other ingredients to see whether the diarrhea responds to a change in diet.  - Sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy. These tests may be used to look for signs of intestinal diseases that cause chronic diarrhea. For sigmoidoscopy, the doctor uses a thin, flexible, lighted tube with a lens on the end to look at the inside of the rectum and lower part of the colon. Colonoscopy is similar to sigmoidoscopy, but it allows the doctor to view the entire colon.",

Other people start to have symptoms later, when they are teenagers or adults.  - Infection, disease, or other problems that harm the small intestine can cause low lactase levels. Low lactase levels can cause you to become lactose intolerant until your small intestine heals.  - Being born early may cause babies to be lactose intolerant for a short time after they are born.  - In a rare form of lactose intolerance, the small intestine produces little or no lactase enzyme from birth.\n                \nNot all people with low lactase levels have symptoms. If you have symptoms, you are lactose intolerant.\n                \nMost people who are lactose intolerant can have some milk or milk products and not have symptoms. The amount of lactose that causes symptoms is different from person to person.\n                \n\n                \nPeople sometimes confuse lactose intolerance with a milk allergy. While lactose intolerance is a digestive problem, a milk allergy is a reaction by the bodys immune system to one or more milk proteins. If you have a milk allergy, having even a small amount of milk or milk product can be life threatening. A milk allergy most commonly occurs in the first year of life. Lactose intolerance occurs more often during the teen years or adulthood.",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Lactose intolerance is the inability to digest lactose, a sugar found in milk and dairy products. Here's what you need to know:\n\n1. Symptoms: They usually occur within 30 minutes to 2 hours after consuming dairy. These may include bloating, diarrhea, gas, and stomach pain or cramps.\n\n2. Cause: It's often due to a lack of lactase, an enzyme produced in the small intestine that breaks down lactose into simpler sugars for absorption.\n\n3. Diagnosis: Usually based on symptoms and a hydrogen breath test or a stool acidity test for infants and young children.\n\n4. Treatment: Avoiding dairy products or using over-the-counter lactase enzyme supplements before eating dairy. Lactose-free milk and other dairy products, as well as soy, almond, and rice milk, are alternatives.\n\n5. Note: Some people can tolerate small amounts of lactose. You may need to experiment to find your comfort level.\n\n6. When to see a doctor: If your symptoms are severe or you're unable to get relief from over-the-counter products, you should seek medical attention.",
        "original_answer": "Talk with your doctor about your dietary plan. A dietary plan can help you manage the symptoms of lactose intolerance and get enough nutrients. If you have a child with lactose intolerance, follow the diet plan that your childs doctor recommends.\n                \nMilk and milk products. You may be able to have milk and milk products without symptoms if you\n                \n- drink small amounts of milkhalf a cup or lessat a time  - drink small amounts of milk with meals, such as having milk with cereal or having cheese with crackers  - add small amounts of milk and milk products to your diet a little at a time and see how you feel  - eat milk products that are easier for people with lactose intolerance to break down:      - yogurt    - hard cheeses such as cheddar and Swiss\n                \n\n                \nLactose-free and lactose-reduced milk and milk products.

Other foods that contain calcium include   - fish with soft bones, such as canned salmon or sardines   - broccoli and other leafy green vegetables   - oranges   - almonds, Brazil nuts, and dried beans   - tofu   - products with the label showing added calcium, such as cereals, fruit juices, and soy milk    Vitamin D helps the body absorb and use calcium. Be sure to eat foods that contain vitamin D, such as eggs, liver, and certain kinds of fish, such as salmon. Also, being outside in the sunlight helps your body make vitamin D. Some companies add vitamin D to milk and milk products. If you are able to drink small amounts of milk or eat yogurt, choose those that have vitamin D added.   Talk with your doctor about how to get enough nutrientsincluding calcium and vitamin Din your diet or your childs diet. Ask if you should also take a supplement to get enough calcium and vitamin D.

Among the causes are the following:\n                \n- Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). STDs that can be passed when a person is receiving anal sex are a common cause of proctitis. Common STD infections that can cause proctitis include gonorrhea, chlamydia, syphilis, and herpes. Herpes-induced proctitis may be particularly severe in people who are also infected with the HIV virus.  - Non-STD infections. Infections that are not sexually transmitted also can cause proctitis. Salmonella and Shigella are examples of foodborne bacteria that can cause proctitis. Streptococcal proctitis sometimes occurs in children who have strep throat.  - Anorectal trauma. Proctitis can be caused by trauma to the anorectal areawhich includes the rectum and anusfrom anal sex or the insertion of objects or harmful substances into the rectum, including the chemicals in some enemas.  - Ulcerative colitis and Crohns disease. Two forms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)ulcerative colitis and Crohns diseasecan cause proctitis. Ulcerative colitis causes irritation and ulcers, also called sores, in the inner lining of the colonpart of the large intestineand rectum. Crohns disease usually causes irritation in the lower small intestinealso called the ileumor the colon, but it can affect any part of the GI tract.  - Radiation therapy. People who have had radiation therapy that targets the pelvic area also may develop proctitis. Examples of those at risk are people with rectal, ovarian, or prostate cancer who have received radiation treatment directed to those areas. Symptoms of radiation proctitis, most commonly rectal bleeding, will typically occur within 6 weeks after beginning radiation therapy or more than 9 months after its completion.  - Antibiotics. Use of antibiotics may be associated with proctitis in some people. While meant to kill infectioncausing bacteria, antibiotics can also kill nonharmful, or commensal, bacteria in the GI tract. The loss of commensal bacteria can then allow other harmful bacteria known as Clostridium difficile to cause an infection in the colon and rectum.",

        "original_answer": "To diagnose proctitis, a health care provider will take a complete medical history and do a physical exam. The health care provider will ask the patient about symptoms, current and past medical conditions, family history, and sexual behavior that increases the risk of STD-induced proctitis. The physical exam will include an assessment of the patients vital signs, an abdominal exam, and a rectal exam.\n                \nBased on the patients physical exam, symptoms, and other medical information, the doctor will decide which lab tests and diagnostic tests are needed. Lab tests may include blood tests such as a complete blood count to evaluate for blood loss or infection, stool tests to isolate and identify bacteria that may cause disease, and an STD screening. The doctor also may use one of the following diagnostic tests:\n                \n- Rectal culture. A cotton swab is inserted into the rectum to obtain a sample that can be used in tests that isolate and identify organisms that may cause disease.  - Anoscopy. This test allows examination of the anal canal and lower rectum by opening the anus using a special instrument called an anoscope.  - Flexible sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy. These tests are used to help diagnose Crohns disease. The tests are similar, but colonoscopy is used to view the entire colon and rectum, while flexible sigmoidoscopy is used to view just the lower colon and rectum. For both tests, a health care provider will provide written bowel prep instructions to follow at home before the test. The person may be asked to follow a clear liquid diet for 1 to 3 days before the test. A laxative may be required the night before the test. One or more enemas may be required the night before and about 2 hours before the test.",

The treatment for proctitis depends on the underlying cause.\n\nFor infectious proctitis, antibiotics or antiviral medications may be prescribed to treat the infection. In cases of proctitis caused by inflammatory bowel disease, such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, medications to reduce inflammation and suppress the immune system may be used.\n\nIn some cases, proctitis may be treated with 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) medications, such as mesalamine, which can help reduce inflammation in the rectum. Corticosteroids may also be used to reduce inflammation, although they are typically used for short periods of time due to potential side effects.\n\nIf proctitis is caused by injury, such as from anal sex or other trauma, treatment may involve avoiding activities that cause irritation and using medications to reduce inflammation. In severe cases, surgery may be required.\n\nIt is important to consult with a healthcare provider for an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan for proctitis.",
        "original_answer": "Treatment of proctitis depends on its cause. The goal of treatment is to reduce inflammation, control symptoms, and eliminate infection, if it is present. Only a doctor can determine the cause of proctitis and the best course of treatment. With proper medical attention, proctitis can be successfully treated.\n                \nProctitis from Infection\n                \nIf lab tests confirm that an STD or non-STD infection is present, medication is prescribed based on the type of infection found. Antibiotics are prescribed to kill bacteria; antiviral medications are prescribed to treat viruses. Although some STD viruses cannot be eliminated, antivirals can control their symptoms.\n                \nProctitis from Other Causes\n                \nIf antibiotic use triggered proctitis, the doctor may prescribe a different antibiotic designed to destroy the harmful bacteria that have developed in the intestines.\n                \nIf proctitis is caused by anorectal trauma, the activity causing the inflammation should be stopped. Healing usually occurs in 4 to 6 weeks. The doctor may recommend over-the-counter medications such as antidiarrheals and those used for pain relief, such as aspirin and ibuprofen.\n                \nTreatment of radiation proctitis is based on symptoms. Radiation proctitis causing only mild symptoms such as occasional bleeding or tenesmus may heal without treatment. For people with persistent or severe bleeding, thermal therapy may be used to stop bleeding and inflammation. Thermal therapy is done during flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy and targets the rectal lining with a heat probe, electric current, or laser. Argon plasma coagulation is the most common thermal therapy used to control bleeding in radiation proctitis. In many cases, several treatments are required. Obstruction that results from a stricturea narrowing of the rectumcaused by radiation proctitis may be treated with stool softeners in mild cases. In people with narrower strictures, dilation to enlarge the narrow area may be required. Sucralfate, 5-aminosalicylic acidknown as 5-ASAor corticosteroid enemas can also be used to ease pain and reduce inflammation from radiation proctitis, although their effectiveness is limited.\n                \nWhen a chronic IBD such as ulcerative colitis or Crohns disease causes proctitis, treatment aims to reduce inflammation, control symptoms, and induce and maintain remissiona period when the person is symptom-free. Treatment depends on the extent and severity of the disease.\n                \nAnti-inflammation medications. Mild proctitis can often be effectively treated with topical mesalamine, either suppositories or enemas.\n                \nSome people with IBD and proctitis cannot tolerateor may have an incomplete response torectal therapy with 5-ASA suppositories or enemas. For these people, the doctor may prescribe oral medications alone or in combination with rectal therapy. Oral medications commonly used for proctitis contain salicylate. These include sulfasalazine- or mesalamine-containing medications, such as Asacol, Dipentum, or Pentasa. Possible side effects of oral administration of sulfasalazine- or mesalaminecontaining medications include nausea, vomiting, heartburn, diarrhea, and headache. Improvement in symptoms, including a decrease in bleeding, can occur within a few days, although complete healing requires 4 to 6 weeks of therapy.\n                \nCortisone or steroids. These medications, also called corticosteroids, are effective at reducing inflammation. Prednisone and budesonide are generic names of two medications in this group. Corticosteroids for proctitis may be taken in pill, suppository, or enema form. When symptoms are at their worst, corticosteroids are usually prescribed in a large dose. The dosage is then gradually lowered once symptoms are controlled. Corticosteroids can cause serious side effects, including greater susceptibility to infection and osteoporosis, or weakening of the bones.\n                \nImmune system suppressors. Medications that suppress the immune systemcalled immunosuppressive medicationsare also used to treat proctitis. The most commonly prescribed medication is 6-mercaptopurine or a related medication, azathioprine. Immunosuppressive medications work by blocking the immune reaction that contributes to inflammation. These medications may cause side effects such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea and may lower a persons resistance to infection. Some patients are treated with a combination of corticosteroids and immunosuppressive medications. Some studies suggest that immunosuppressive medications may enhance the effectiveness of corticosteroids.\n                \nInfliximab (Remicade). Researchers have found that high levels of a protein produced by the immune system, called tumor necrosis factor (TNF), are present in people with Crohns disease. Infliximab is the first of a group of medications that bind to TNF substances to block the bodys inflammation response. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the medication for the treatment of moderate to severe Crohns disease that does not respond to standard therapiesmesalamine substances, corticosteroids, immunosuppressive medicationsand for the treatment of open, draining fistulas. The medication is also given to people who have Crohns disease with proctitis. Some studies suggest that infliximab may enhance the effectiveness of immunosuppressive medications.\n                \nBacterial infection can occur with flare-ups of ulcerative colitis or Crohns disease. Antibiotics may also be used to treat flare-ups in people with IBD and proctitis.\n                \nMore information about the treatment of IBD is provided in the NIDDK health topics, Ulcerative Colitis and Crohns Disease.",

Physical exam: A physical exam may reveal a distended abdomen or stool trapped in the colon.\n3. Rectal exam: A digital rectal exam can help determine if the lower part of the colon is narrowed or if there is a lack of muscle tone.\n4. X-ray or ultrasound: Imaging tests such as an abdominal X-ray or an ultrasound may be used to look for signs of obstruction or to rule out other conditions.\n5. Contrast enema: A special type of X-ray called a contrast enema can provide more detailed images of the colon and help diagnose Hirschsprung disease.\n6. Anorectal manometry: This test measures the coordination and strength of the muscles in the anus and rectum.\n7. Biopsy: A biopsy, which involves removing a small piece of tissue from the rectum or colon, is the definitive way to diagnose Hirschsprung disease. The tissue is examined under a microscope for the absence of nerve cells, which is a hallmark of the condition.\n\nIt is important to consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment.",

        "original_answer": "Pull-through Procedure\n                \nHD is treated with surgery called a pull-through procedure. A surgeon removes the segment of the large intestine lacking nerve cells and connects the healthy segment to the anus. The pull-through procedure is usually done soon after diagnosis.\n                \nOstomy surgery\n                \nAn ostomy allows stool to leave the body through an opening in the abdomen. Although most children with HD do not need an ostomy, a child who has been very sick from HD may need an ostomy to get better before the pull-through procedure.\n                \nFor ostomy surgery, the surgeon first takes out the diseased segment of the large intestine. The end of the healthy intestine is moved to an opening in the abdomen where a stoma is created. A stoma is created by rolling the intestines end back on itself, like a shirt cuff, and stitching it to the abdominal wall. An ostomy pouch is attached to the stoma and worn outside the body to collect stool. The pouch will need to be emptied several times each day.\n                \n\n                \nIf the surgeon removes the entire large intestine and connects the small intestine to the stoma, the surgery is called an ileostomy. If the surgeon leaves part of the large intestine and connects it to the stoma, the surgery is called a colostomy.\n                \nLater, during the pull-through procedure, the surgeon removes the stoma and closes the abdomen with stitches.",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Hirschsprung disease is a condition that affects the muscles in the lower part of the colon, causing blockage of the intestine. Here's what you need to know:\n\n1. Symptoms: Common symptoms include failure to pass meconium (the first stool) in newborns, constipation, vomiting, swollen abdomen, diarrhea, and poor growth.\n2. Causes: It's caused by the absence of nerve cells (ganglion cells) in the muscles of the colon, which control the movement of stool.\n3. Diagnosis: Diagnosis typically involves a physical exam, medical history, and tests such as abdominal X-rays, rectal biopsy, or anorectal manometry.\n4. Treatment: The standard treatment is surgery to remove the affected part of the colon and reattach the healthy part to the rectum.\n5. Prognosis: With proper treatment, most children with Hirschsprung disease can lead normal, healthy lives. However, some may experience long-term complications such as constipation, fecal incontinence, or enterocolitis.\n\nIf you suspect your child has Hirschsprung disease, it's important to seek medical attention right away. Early diagnosis and treatment can help prevent serious complications.",
        "original_answer": "- Hirschsprung disease (HD) is a disease of the large intestine that causes severe constipation or intestinal obstruction. People with HD are born with it.  - The large intestine, which includes the colon and rectum, is the last part of the digestive tract.  - The cause of HD is unclear. HD is not caused by anything a mother did while pregnant.  - The main symptoms of HD are constipation or intestinal obstruction, usually appearing shortly after birth.  - Newborns with HD almost always fail to have their first bowel movement within 48 hours after birth.  - HD is diagnosed based on symptoms and test results.  - HD is treated with surgery called a pull-through procedure.  - A child who has been very sick from HD may need an ostomy to get better before the pull-through procedure.  - Most children pass stool normally after the pull-through procedure.  - People with HD can suffer from an infection of the intestines, called enterocolitis, before or after surgery.  - If you have a child with HD, your chance of having more children with HD is greater.",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Gestational diabetes is a type of diabetes that develops during pregnancy. It is caused by hormonal changes that make the body less able to use insulin, a hormone that regulates blood sugar levels. This results in high blood sugar levels, which can cause complications for both the mother and the baby. Risk factors for gestational diabetes include being overweight or obese, having a family history of diabetes, and having had gestational diabetes in a previous pregnancy. It's important for pregnant women to be screened for gestational diabetes and to manage their blood sugar levels through diet, exercise, and, if necessary, medication.",
        "original_answer": "Gestational diabetes happens when your body can't make enough insulin during pregnancy. Insulin is a hormone made in your pancreas, an organ located behind your stomach. Insulin helps your body use glucose for energy and helps control your blood glucose levels.\n                \nDuring pregnancy, your body makes more hormones and goes through other changes, such as weight gain. These changes cause your body's cells to use insulin less effectively, a condition called insulin resistance. Insulin resistance increases your body's need for insulin. If your pancreas can't make enough insulin, you will have gestational diabetes.\n                \nAll pregnant women have some insulin resistance during late pregnancy. However, some women have insulin resistance even before they get pregnant, usually because they are overweight.

Here's what you need to know:\n\n1. **Testing**: It's usually diagnosed through a glucose tolerance test between 24 and 28 weeks of pregnancy.\n2. **Diet and Exercise**: Managing gestational diabetes typically involves a healthy diet, regular exercise, and monitoring blood sugar levels.\n3. **Blood Sugar Monitoring**: You'll need to check your blood sugar levels regularly, often multiple times a day.\n4. **Potential Complications**: If not managed properly, gestational diabetes can increase the risk of complications for both the mother and baby, such as high birth weight and preterm birth.\n5. **Postpartum Follow-up**: After delivery, blood sugar levels usually return to normal. However, women who have had gestational diabetes are at higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes later in life, so regular postpartum follow-up is important.\n\nRemember, it's crucial to follow your healthcare provider's advice regarding diet, exercise, and monitoring your blood sugar levels. If you have any concerns or questions, don't hesitate to reach out to your healthcare provider.",
        "original_answer": "- Gestational diabetes is a type of diabetes that develops only during pregnancy. Diabetes means your blood glucose, also called blood sugar, is too high.  - Gestational diabetes happens when your body can't make enough insulin during pregnancy. Insulin is a hormone made in your pancreas, an organ located behind your stomach. Insulin helps your body use glucose for energy and helps control your blood glucose levels.  - You will probably be tested for gestational diabetes between weeks 24 and 28 of your pregnancy. If you have a higher chance of getting gestational diabetes, your doctor may test you for diabetes during your first visit after you become pregnant.  - If you have high blood glucose levels because your gestational diabetes is not under control, your baby will also have high blood glucose.  - Untreated or uncontrolled gestational diabetes can cause problems for your baby.  - Treating gestational diabetes means taking steps to keep your blood glucose levels in a target range.  - Even if your blood glucose levels return to normal after your pregnancy, your chances of getting diabetesusually type 2 diabeteslater in life are high. Therefore, you should be tested at least every 3 years for diabetes or prediabetes.  - You can give your baby a healthy start by breastfeeding.  - You can help your child be healthy by showing your child how to make healthy lifestyle choices, including being physically active, limiting screen time in front of the TV or video games, eating a healthy diet, and staying at a healthy weight.",

        "original_answer": "Insulin is a hormone made in the pancreas, an organ located behind the stomach. The pancreas contains clusters of cells called islets. Beta cells within the islets make insulin and release it into the blood.\n                \nInsulin plays a major role in metabolismthe way the body uses digested food for energy. The digestive tract breaks down carbohydratessugars and starches found in many foodsinto glucose. Glucose is a form of sugar that enters the bloodstream. With the help of insulin, cells throughout the body absorb glucose and use it for energy.\n                \nInsulin's Role in Blood Glucose Control\n                \nWhen blood glucose levels rise after a meal, the pancreas releases insulin into the blood. Insulin and glucose then travel in the blood to cells throughout the body.\n                \n- Insulin helps muscle, fat, and liver cells absorb glucose from the bloodstream, lowering blood glucose levels.  - Insulin stimulates the liver and muscle tissue to store excess glucose. The stored form of glucose is called glycogen.  - Insulin also lowers blood glucose levels by reducing glucose production in the liver.\n                \nIn a healthy person, these functions allow blood glucose and insulin levels to remain in the normal range.",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Insulin resistance and prediabetes are related conditions that are caused by a combination of genetic and lifestyle factors.\n\nInsulin resistance occurs when the body's cells become less responsive to insulin, a hormone that regulates blood sugar levels. This causes the body to produce more insulin to maintain normal blood sugar levels, leading to high insulin levels in the blood.\n\nPrediabetes is a condition in which blood sugar levels are higher than normal but not high enough to be diagnosed as diabetes. It is often a precursor to type 2 diabetes and is frequently caused by insulin resistance.\n\nSome of the factors that contribute to insulin resistance and prediabetes include:\n\n1. Genetics: Having a family history of diabetes or insulin resistance increases the risk of developing these conditions.\n2. Weight: Being overweight or obese is a significant risk factor for insulin resistance and prediabetes. Excess body fat, particularly in the abdominal area, can interfere with the body's ability to use insulin effectively.\n3. Physical inactivity: Lack of regular physical activity can contribute to insulin resistance and prediabetes by making it harder for the body to use insulin effectively.\n4. Diet: A diet high in processed foods, sugary drinks, and unhealthy fats can increase the risk of insulin resistance and prediabetes.\n5. Age: As people age, their risk of insulin resistance and prediabetes increases, even if they maintain a healthy weight and lifestyle.\n\nBy making lifestyle changes such as losing weight, increasing physical activity, and eating a healthy diet, it is possible to prevent or delay the onset of insulin resistance and prediabetes. If you are concerned about your risk of these conditions, it is important to speak with a healthcare provider.",
        "original_answer": "Although the exact causes of insulin resistance are not completely understood, scientists think the major contributors to insulin resistance are excess weight and physical inactivity.\n                \nExcess Weight\n                \nSome experts believe obesity, especially excess fat around the waist, is a primary cause of insulin resistance. Scientists used to think that fat tissue functioned solely as energy storage. However, studies have shown that belly fat produces hormones and other substances that can cause serious health problems such as insulin resistance, high blood pressure, imbalanced cholesterol, and cardiovascular disease (CVD).\n                \nBelly fat plays a part in developing chronic, or long-lasting, inflammation in the body. Chronic inflammation can damage the body over time, without any signs or symptoms. Scientists have found that complex interactions in fat tissue draw immune cells to the area and trigger low-level chronic inflammation. This inflammation can contribute to the development of insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and CVD. Studies show that losing the weight can reduce insulin resistance and prevent or delay type 2 diabetes.\n                \nPhysical Inactivity\n                \nMany studies have shown that physical inactivity is associated with insulin resistance, often leading to type 2 diabetes. In the body, more glucose is used by muscle than other tissues. Normally, active muscles burn their stored glucose for energy and refill their reserves with glucose taken from the bloodstream, keeping blood glucose levels in balance.\n                \nStudies show that after exercising, muscles become more sensitive to insulin, reversing insulin resistance and lowering blood glucose levels. Exercise also helps muscles absorb more glucose without the need for insulin. The more muscle a body has, the more glucose it can burn to control blood glucose levels.\n                \nOther Causes\n                \nOther causes of insulin resistance may include ethnicity; certain diseases; hormones; steroid use; some medications; older age; sleep problems, especially sleep apnea; and cigarette smoking.\n                \n\n                \nDoes sleep matter?   Yes. Studies show that untreated sleep problems, especially sleep apnea, can increase the risk of obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes. Night shift workers may also be at increased risk for these problems. Sleep apnea is a common disorder in which a person's breathing is interrupted during sleep. People may often move out of deep sleep and into light sleep when their breathing pauses or becomes shallow. This results in poor sleep quality that causes problem sleepiness, or excessive tiredness, during the day.   Many people aren't aware of their symptoms and aren't diagnosed. People who think they might have sleep problems should talk with their health care provider.   More information about sleep problems is available from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute at http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/resources/sleep.",

However, there is no standardized test to diagnose insulin resistance, and it is often identified based on other risk factors and symptoms.\n\nPrediabetes is typically diagnosed through a fasting plasma glucose test, an oral glucose tolerance test, or an A1C test. A fasting plasma glucose test measures your blood sugar level after an overnight fast. An oral glucose tolerance test measures your blood sugar level after you drink a sugary drink. An A1C test measures your average blood sugar level over the past two to three months.\n\nIf your doctor suspects that you have insulin resistance or prediabetes, they may recommend further testing and monitoring to confirm the diagnosis and develop a treatment plan. It is important to note that early detection and management of insulin resistance and prediabetes can help prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetes.",
        "original_answer": "Health care providers use blood tests to determine whether a person has prediabetes, but they do not usually test specifically for insulin resistance. Insulin resistance can be assessed by measuring the level of insulin in the blood.\n                \nHowever, the test that most accurately measures insulin resistance, called the euglycemic clamp, is too costly and complicated to be used in most health care providers' offices. The clamp is a research tool used by scientists to learn more about glucose metabolism. Research has shown that if blood tests indicate prediabetes, insulin resistance most likely is present.\n                \nBlood Tests for Prediabetes\n                \nAll blood tests involve drawing blood at a health care provider's office or commercial facility and sending the sample to a lab for analysis. Lab analysis of blood is needed to ensure test results are accurate. Glucose measuring devices used in a health care provider's office, such as finger-stick devices, are not accurate enough for diagnosis but may be used as a quick indicator of high blood glucose.\n                \nPrediabetes can be detected with one of the following blood tests:\n                \n- the A1C test  - the fasting plasma glucose (FPG) test  - the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)\n                \nA1C test. Sometimes called hemoglobin A1c, HbA1c, or glycohemoglobin test, this test reflects average blood glucose levels over the past 3 months. This test is the most reliable test for prediabetes, but it is not as sensitive as the other tests. In some individuals, it may miss prediabetes that could be caught by glucose tests.\n                \nAlthough some health care providers can quickly measure A1C in their office, that type of measurementcalled a point-of-care testis not considered reliable for diagnosis.

Interference should be suspected when A1C results seem very different from the results of a blood glucose test. People of African, Mediterranean, or Southeast Asian descent, or people with family members with sickle cell anemia or a thalassemia, are particularly at risk of interference. People in these groups may have a less common type of hemoglobin, known as a hemoglobin variant, that can interfere with some A1C tests.\n                \nAn A1C of 5.7 to 6.4 percent indicates prediabetes.\n                \nMore information about the A1C test is provided in the NIDDK health topic, The A1C Test and Diabetes.\n                \nFasting plasma glucose test.

In the DPP, metformin was shown to be most effective in preventing or delaying the development of type 2 diabetes in younger, heavier people with prediabetes. In general, metformin is recommend for those who are younger than age 60 and have\n                \n- combined IGT and IFG  - A1C above 6 percent  - low HDL cholesterol  - elevated triglycerides  - a parent or sibling with diabetes  - a BMI of at least 35\n                \nMetformin also lowers the risk of diabetes in women who have had gestational diabetes. People at high risk should ask their health care provider if they should take metformin to prevent type 2 diabetes.\n                \nSeveral medications have been shown to reduce type 2 diabetes risk to varying degrees, but the only medication recommended by the ADA for type 2 diabetes prevention is metformin. Other medications that have delayed diabetes have side effects or haven't shown long-lasting benefits. No medication, including metformin, is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat insulin resistance or prediabetes or to prevent type 2 diabetes.",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "If you have been diagnosed with insulin resistance and prediabetes, here are some steps you can take:\n\n1. Lifestyle modifications: Making changes to your lifestyle can have a significant impact on managing insulin resistance and prediabetes. This includes:\n* Eating a healthy diet that is low in processed foods, sugars, and unhealthy fats, and high in fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains.\n* Getting regular physical activity, aiming for at least 30 minutes per day, most days of the week.\n* Losing weight if you are overweight or obese, as even a small amount of weight loss can improve insulin sensitivity.\n1. Medication: If lifestyle changes are not enough to manage your insulin resistance and prediabetes, your doctor may prescribe medication to help lower your blood sugar levels. The most common medication used is metformin.\n2. Regular monitoring: It's important to regularly monitor your blood sugar levels to ensure they are within a healthy range. Your doctor may recommend regular A1C tests to measure your average blood sugar levels over the past three months.\n3. Consider working with a dietitian or diabetes educator: They can provide personalized guidance on meal planning, physical activity, and blood sugar monitoring.\n\nRemember, managing insulin resistance and prediabetes is a team effort, and your healthcare provider is there to support you every step of the way.",
        "original_answer": "- Insulin is a hormone that helps cells throughout the body absorb glucose and use it for energy. Insulin resistance is a condition in which the body produces insulin but does not use it effectively.  - Insulin resistance increases the risk of developing type 2 diabetes and prediabetes.  - The major contributors to insulin resistance are excess weight, especially around the waist, and physical inactivity.  - Prediabetes is a condition in which blood glucose or A1C levelswhich reflect average blood glucose levelsare higher than normal but not high enough for a diagnosis of diabetes.  - The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) study and its follow-up study, the Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study (DPPOS), confirmed that people with prediabetes can often prevent or delay diabetes if they lose a modest amount of weight by cutting fat and calorie intake and increasing physical activity.  - By losing weight and being more physically active, people can reverse insulin resistance and prediabetes, thus preventing or delaying type 2 diabetes.  - People with insulin resistance and prediabetes can decrease their risk for diabetes by eating a healthy diet and reaching and maintaining a healthy weight, increasing physical activity, not smoking, and taking medication.  - The DPP showed the diabetes medication metformin to be most effective in preventing or delaying the development of type 2 diabetes in younger and heavier people with prediabetes and women who have had gestational diabetes.",

        "original_answer": "The exact cause of Crohn's disease is unknown. Researchers believe the following factors may play a role in causing Crohn's disease:\n                \n- autoimmune reaction  - genes  - environment\n                \nAutoimmune reaction. Scientists believe one cause of Crohn's disease may be an autoimmune reactionwhen a person's immune system attacks healthy cells in the body by mistake. Normally, the immune system protects the body from infection by identifying and destroying bacteria, viruses, and other potentially harmful foreign substances. Researchers believe bacteria or viruses can mistakenly trigger the immune system to attack the inner lining of the intestines. This immune system response causes the inflammation, leading to symptoms.\n                \nGenes. Crohn's disease sometimes runs in families. Research has shown that people who have a parent or sibling with Crohn's disease may be more likely to develop the disease. Researchers continue to study the link between genes and Crohn's disease.\n                \nEnvironment. Some studies suggest that certain things in the environment may increase the chance of a person getting Crohn's disease, although the overall chance is low. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,1 antibiotics,2 and oral contraceptives2 may slightly increase the chance of developing Crohn's disease. A high-fat diet may also slightly increase the chance of getting Crohn's disease.3\n                \nSome people incorrectly believe that eating certain foods, stress, or emotional distress can cause Crohn's disease.

        "original_answer": "A health care provider diagnoses Crohn's disease with the following:\n                \n- medical and family history  - physical exam  - lab tests  - upper GI series  - computerized tomography (CT) scan  - intestinal endoscopy\n                \nThe health care provider may perform a series of medical tests to rule out other bowel diseases, such as irritable bowel syndrome, ulcerative colitis, or celiac disease, that cause symptoms similar to those of Crohn's disease.\n                \nMedical and Family History\n                \nTaking a medical and family history can help a health care provider diagnose Crohn's disease and understand a patient's symptoms. He or she will ask the patient to describe his or her\n                \n- family history  - symptoms  - current and past medical conditions  - current medications\n                \nPhysical Exam\n                \nA physical exam may help diagnose Crohn's disease. During a physical exam, the health care provider most often\n                \n- checks for abdominal distension, or swelling  - listens to sounds within the abdomen using a stethoscope  - taps on the abdomen to check for tenderness and pain and establish if the liver or spleen is abnormal or enlarged\n                \nLab Tests\n                \nA health care provider may order lab tests, including blood and stool tests.\n                \nBlood tests. A blood test involves drawing blood at a health care provider's office or a lab. A lab technologist will analyze the blood sample. A health care provider may use blood tests to look for changes in\n                \n- red blood cells. When red blood cells are fewer or smaller than normal, a patient may have anemia.  - white blood cells. When the white blood cell count is higher than normal, a person may have inflammation or infection somewhere in his or her body.\n                \nStool tests. A stool test is the analysis of a sample of stool. A health care provider will give the patient a container for catching and storing the stool at home. The patient returns the sample to the health care provider or to a lab. A lab technologist will analyze the stool sample. Health care providers commonly order stool tests to rule out other causes of GI diseases.\n                \nUpper Gastrointestinal Series\n                \nAn upper GI series, also called a barium swallow, uses x-rays and fluoroscopy to help diagnose problems of the upper GI tract. Fluoroscopy is a form of x-ray that makes it possible to see the internal organs and their motion on a video monitor. An x-ray technician performs this test at a hospital or an outpatient center, and a radiologista doctor who specializes in medical imaginginterprets the images.\n                \nThis test does not require anesthesia. A patient should not eat or drink before the procedure, as directed by the health care provider. Patients should ask their health care provider about how to prepare for an upper GI series.\n                \nDuring the procedure, the patient will stand or sit in front of an x-ray machine and drink barium, a chalky liquid. Barium coats the esophagus, stomach, and small intestine so the radiologist and a health care provider can see the shape of these organs more clearly on x-rays.\n                \nA patient may experience bloating and nausea for a short time after the test. For several days afterward, barium liquid in the GI tract causes white or light-colored stools. A health care provider will give the patient specific instructions about eating and drinking after the test.\n                \nComputerized Tomography Scan\n                \nComputerized tomography scans use a combination of x-rays and computer technology to create images. For a CT scan, a health care provider may give the patient a solution to drink and an injection of a special dye, called contrast medium. CT scans require the patient to lie on a table that slides into a tunnel-shaped device where the x-rays are taken. An x-ray technician performs the procedure in an outpatient center or a hospital, and a radiologist interprets the images. The patient does not need anesthesia. CT scans can diagnose both Crohn's disease and the complications seen with the disease.\n                \nIntestinal Endoscopy\n                \nIntestinal endoscopies are the most accurate methods for diagnosing Crohn's disease and ruling out other possible conditions, such as ulcerative colitis, diverticular disease, or cancer. Intestinal endoscopies include\n                \n- upper GI endoscopy and enteroscopy  - capsule endoscopy  - colonoscopy\n                \nUpper GI endoscopy and enteroscopy. An upper GI endoscopy is a procedure that uses an endoscopea small, flexible tube with a lightto directly visualize the lining of the upper GI tract. A health care provider performs the procedure at a hospital or an outpatient center. A nurse or technician may give the patient a liquid anesthetic to gargle or will spray the anesthetic on the back of a patient's throat. The anesthetic numbs the throat and calms the gag reflex. The nurse or technician will then place an intravenous (IV) needle in the person's arm or hand to provide a sedative. The health care provider carefully feeds the endoscope down the patient's esophagus and into the stomach. A small camera on the endoscope sends a video image to a monitor, allowing close examination of the GI tract.\n                \nDuring an enteroscopy, the health care provider examines the small intestine with a special, longer endoscope. The health care provider carefully feeds the endoscope into the small intestine using one of the following procedures:\n                \n- push enteroscopy, which uses a long endoscope to examine the upper portion of the small intestine  - single- or double-balloon enteroscopy, which use small balloons to help move the endoscope into the small intestine  - spiral enteroscopy, which uses a tube attached to an endocope that acts as a cork screw to move the instrument into the small intestine\n                \nThe procedure most often takes between 15 and 60 minutes. The endoscope does not interfere with the patient's breathing, and many patients fall asleep during the procedure.\n                \nCapsule endoscopy. Although this procedure can examine the entire digestive tract, health care providers use it mostly to examine the small intestine. The patient swallows a capsule containing a tiny camera. As the capsule passes through the GI tract, the camera will record and transmit images to a small receiver device worn by the patient. When the recording is done, the health care provider downloads the images and reviews them on a video monitor. The camera capsule leaves the patient's body during a bowel movement and is safely flushed down the toilet.\n                \nColonoscopy. Colonoscopy is a test that uses a long, flexible, narrow tube with a light and tiny camera on one end, called a colonoscope or scope, to look inside a patient's rectum and entire colon. In most cases, light anesthesia and pain medication help patients relax for the test. The medical staff will monitor a patient's vital signs and try to make him or her as comfortable as possible. A nurse or technician will place an IV needle in a vein in the patient's arm or hand to give anesthesia.\n                \nFor the test, the patient will lie on a table or stretcher while the gastroenterologist inserts a colonoscope into the patient's anus and slowly guides it through the rectum and into the colon. The scope inflates the large intestine with air to give the gastroenterologist a better view. The camera sends a video image of the intestinal lining to a monitor, allowing the gastroenterologist to examine the tissues lining the colon and rectum. The gastroenterologist may move the patient several times and adjust the scope for better viewing. Once the scope has reached the opening to the small intestine, the gastroenterologist slowly withdraws it and examines the lining of the colon and rectum again.\n                \nA colonoscopy can show inflamed and swollen tissue, ulcers, and abnormal growths such as polypsextra pieces of tissue that grow on the inner lining of the intestine. If the gastroenterologist suspects Crohn's disease, he or she will biopsy the patient's colon and rectum. A biopsy is a procedure that involves taking small pieces of tissue for examination with a microscope.\n                \nA health care provider will give patients written bowel prep instructions to follow at home before the test. The health care provider will also give patients information about how to care for themselves following the procedure.",

Aminosalicylates include\n                \n- balsalazide  - mesalamine  - olsalazine  - sulfasalazinea combination of sulfapyridine and 5-ASA\n                \nSome of the common side effects of aminosalicylates include\n                \n- abdominal pain  - diarrhea  - headaches  - heartburn  - nausea and vomiting\n                \nCorticosteroids, also known as steroids, help reduce the activity of the immune system and decrease inflammation. Health care providers prescribe corticosteroids for people with moderate to severe symptoms. Corticosteroids include\n                \n- budesonide  - hydrocortisone  - methylprednisone  - prednisone\n                \nSide effects of corticosteroids include\n                \n- acne  - a higher chance of developing infections  - bone mass loss  - high blood glucose  - high blood pressure  - mood swings  - weight gain\n                \nIn most cases, health care providers do not prescribe corticosteroids for long-term use.\n                \nImmunomodulators reduce immune system activity, resulting in less inflammation in the GI tract. These medications can take several weeks to 3 months to start working. Immunomodulators include\n                \n- 6-mercaptopurine, or 6-MP  - azathioprine  - cyclosporine  - methotrexate\n                \nHealth care providers prescribe these medications to help people with Crohn's disease go into remission or to help people who do not respond to other treatments. People taking these medications may have the following side effects:\n                \n- a low white blood cell count, which can lead to a higher chance of infection  - fatigue, or feeling tired  - nausea and vomiting  - pancreatitis\n                \nHealth care providers most often prescribe cyclosporine only to people with severe Crohn's disease because of the medication's serious side effects. People should talk with their health care provider about the risks and benefits of cyclosporine.\n                \nBiologic therapies are medications that target a protein made by the immune system. Neutralizing this protein decreases inflammation in the intestine. Biologic therapies work quickly to bring on remission, especially in people who do not respond to other medications. Biologic therapies include\n                \n- adalimumab  - certolizumab  - infliximab  - natalizumab  - vedolizumab\n                \nHealth care providers most often give patients infliximab every 6 to 8 weeks at a hospital or an outpatient center. Side effects may include a toxic reaction to the medication and a higher chance of developing infections, particularly tuberculosis.\n                \nOther medications to treat symptoms or complications may include\n                \n- acetaminophen for mild pain. People with Crohn's disease should avoid using ibuprofen, naproxen, and aspirin since these medications can make symptoms worse.  - antibiotics to prevent or treat infections and fistulas.  - loperamide to help slow or stop severe diarrhea. In most cases, people only take this medication for short periods of time since it can increase the chance of developing megacolon.\n                \nBowel Rest\n                \nSometimes Crohn's disease symptoms are severe and a person may need to rest his or her bowel for a few days to several weeks. Bowel rest involves drinking only clear liquids or having no oral intake. To provide the patient with nutrition, a health care provider will deliver IV nutrition through a special catheter, or tube, inserted into a vein in the patient's arm. Some patients stay in the hospital, while other patients are able to receive the treatment at home. In most cases, the intestines are able to heal during bowel rest.\n                \nSurgery\n                \nEven with medication treatments, up to 20 percent of people will need surgery to treat their Crohn's disease.1 Although surgery will not cure Crohn's disease, it can treat complications and improve symptoms. Health care providers most often recommend surgery to treat\n                \n- fistulas  - bleeding that is life threatening  - bowel obstructions  - side effects from medications when they threaten a person's health  - symptoms when medications do not improve a person's condition\n                \nA surgeon can perform different types of operations to treat Crohn's disease:\n                \n- small bowel resection  - subtotal colectomy  - proctocolectomy and ileostomy\n                \nPatients will receive general anesthesia. Most patients will stay in the hospital for 3 to 7 days after the surgery. Full recovery may take 4 to 6 weeks.\n                \nSmall bowel resection. Small bowel resection is surgery to remove part of a patient's small intestine. When a patient with Crohn's disease has a blockage or severe disease in the small intestine, a surgeon may need to remove that section of intestine. The two types of small bowel resection are\n                \n- laparoscopicwhen a surgeon makes several small, half-inch incisions in the patient's abdomen. The surgeon inserts a laparoscopea thin tube with a tiny light and video camera on the endthrough the small incisions. The camera sends a magnified image from inside the body to a video monitor, giving the surgeon a close-up view of the small intestine. While watching the monitor, the surgeon inserts tools through the small incisions and removes the diseased or blocked section of small intestine. The surgeon will reconnect the ends of the intestine.  - open surgerywhen a surgeon makes one incision about 6 inches long in the patient's abdomen. The surgeon will locate the diseased or blocked section of small intestine and remove or repair that section. The surgeon will reconnect the ends of the intestine.\n                \nSubtotal colectomy. A subtotal colectomy, also called a large bowel resection, is surgery to remove part of a patient's large intestine. When a patient with Crohn's disease has a blockage, a fistula, or severe disease in the large intestine, a surgeon may need to remove that section of intestine. A surgeon can perform a subtotal colectomy by\n                \n- laparoscopic colectomywhen a surgeon makes several small, half-inch incisions in the abdomen. While watching the monitor, the surgeon removes the diseased or blocked section of the large intestine. The surgeon will reconnect the ends of the intestine.  - open surgerywhen a surgeon makes one incision about 6 to 8 inches long in the abdomen. The surgeon will locate the diseased or blocked section of small intestine and remove that section. The surgeon will reconnect the ends of the intestine.\n                \nProctocolectomy and ileostomy. A proctocolectomy is surgery to remove a patient's entire colon and rectum. An ileostomy is a stoma, or opening in the abdomen, that a surgeon creates from a part of the ileumthe last section of the small intestine. The surgeon brings the end of the ileum through an opening in the patient's abdomen and attaches it to the skin, creating an opening outside of the patient's body. The stoma is about three-fourths of an inch to a little less than 2 inches wide and is most often located in the lower part of the patient's abdomen, just below the beltline.\n                \nA removable external collection pouch, called an ostomy pouch or ostomy appliance, connects to the stoma and collects intestinal contents outside the patient's body. Intestinal contents pass through the stoma instead of passing through the anus. The stoma has no muscle, so it cannot control the flow of intestinal contents, and the flow occurs whenever peristalsis occurs. Peristalsis is the movement of the organ walls that propels food and liquid through the GI tract.\n                \nPeople who have this type of surgery will have the ileostomy for the rest of their lives.",

        "original_answer": "Complications of Crohn's disease can include\n                \n- bowel obstruction. Crohn's disease can thicken the wall of the intestine. Over time, the thickened areas of the intestine can narrow, which can block the intestine. A partial or complete obstruction, also called a bowel blockage, can block the movement of food or stool through the intestines. A complete bowel obstruction is life threatening and requires immediate medical attention and often surgery.  - fistulasabnormal passages, or tunnels, between two organs, or between an organ and the outside of the body. How a health care provider treats fistulas depends on their type and severity. For some people, fistulas heal with medication and diet changes, while other people will need to have surgery.  - anal fissuressmall tears in the anus that may cause itching, pain, or bleeding. Most anal fissures heal with medical treatment, including ointments, warm baths, and dietary changes.  - ulcers.

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Whipple's disease is a rare systemic bacterial infection caused by the bacterium Tropheryma whipplei. The diagnosis of Whipple's disease is often challenging due to its nonspecific symptoms, which can mimic other conditions. Here are the steps to diagnose Whipple's disease:\n\n1. Medical history and physical examination: A healthcare provider will take a detailed medical history and perform a physical examination to assess the patient's symptoms and identify any potential risk factors.\n2. Blood tests: Blood tests may reveal anemia, elevated levels of inflammatory markers, and abnormalities in white blood cell counts.\n3. Imaging studies: Imaging studies, such as computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), may reveal enlarged lymph nodes, thickening of the intestinal wall, or other abnormalities.\n4. Biopsy: The definitive diagnosis of Whipple's disease is made through a biopsy of the affected tissue, typically obtained from the small intestine during an endoscopy. The biopsy sample is then examined under a microscope for the presence of the bacteria Tropheryma whipplei.\n5. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing: PCR testing can be used to detect the genetic material of Tropheryma whipplei in the biopsy sample, providing further confirmation of the diagnosis.\n\nIt is important to note that Whipple's disease is a rare condition, and its symptoms can be similar to other more common conditions. Therefore, a healthcare provider may consider other diagnostic tests and procedures to rule out other potential causes of the patient's symptoms.",
        "original_answer": "A health care provider may use several tests and exams to diagnose Whipple disease, including the following:\n                \n- medical and family history  - physical exam  - blood tests  - upper GI endoscopy and enteroscopy\n                \nA patient may be referred to a gastroenterologista doctor who specializes in digestive diseases.\n                \nA health care provider may first try to rule out more common conditions with similar symptoms, including\n                \n- inflammatory rheumatic diseasecharacterized by inflammation and loss of function in one or more connecting or supporting structures of the body.  - celiac diseasea digestive disease that damages the small intestine and interferes with the absorption of nutrients from food. People who have celiac disease cannot tolerate gluten, a protein in wheat, rye, and barley.  - neurologic diseasesdisorders of the central nervous system.  - intra-abdominal lymphomaabdominal cancer in part of the immune system called the lymphatic system.  - Mycobacterium avium complexan infection that affects people with AIDS.\n                \nMedical and Family History\n                \nTaking a family and medical history can help a health care provider diagnose Whipple disease.\n                \nPhysical Exam\n                \nA physical exam may help diagnose Whipple disease. During a physical exam, a health care provider usually\n                \n- examines a patients body  - uses a stethoscope to listen to sounds related to the abdomen  - taps on specific areas of the patients body checking for pain or tenderness\n                \nBlood Tests\n                \nA technician or nurse draws a blood sample during an office visit or at a commercial facility and sends the sample to a lab for analysis. The health care provider may use blood tests to check for\n                \n- malabsorption. When the damaged villi do not absorb certain nutrients from food, the body has a shortage of protein, calories, and vitamins. Blood tests can show shortages of protein, calories, and vitamins in the body.  - abnormal levels of electrolytes. Electrolyteschemicals in body fluids, including sodium, potassium, magnesium, and chlorideregulate a persons nerve and muscle function. A patient who has malabsorption or a lot of diarrhea may lose fluids and electrolytes, causing an imbalance in the body.  - anemia. Anemia is a condition in which the body has fewer red blood cells than normal. A patient with Whipple disease does not absorb the proper nutrients to make enough red blood cells in the body, leading to anemia.  - T. whipplei DNA. Although not yet approved, rapid polymerase chain reaction diagnostic tests have been developed to detect T. whipplei DNA and may be useful in diagnosis.\n                \nUpper Gastrointestinal Endoscopy and Enteroscopy\n                \nAn upper GI endoscopy and enteroscopy are procedures that use an endoscopea small, flexible tube with a lightto see the upper GI tract. A health care provider performs these tests at a hospital or an outpatient center. The health care provider carefully feeds the endoscope down the esophagus and into the stomach and duodenum.\n                \nOnce the endoscope is in the duodenum, the health care provider will use smaller tools and a smaller scope to see more of the small intestine. These additional procedures may include\n                \n- push enteroscopy, which uses a long endoscope to examine the upper portion of the small intestine.  - double-balloon enteroscopy, which uses balloons to help move the endoscope through the entire small intestine.  - capsule enteroscopy, during which the patient swallows a capsule containing a tiny camera. As the capsule passes through the GI tract, the camera will transmit images to a video monitor. Using this procedure, the health care provider can examine the entire digestive tract.\n                \nA small camera mounted on the endoscope transmits a video image to a monitor, allowing close examination of the intestinal lining. A health care provider may give a patient a liquid anesthetic to gargle or may spray anesthetic on the back of the patients throat. A health care provider will place an intravenous (IV) needle in a vein in the arm or hand to administer sedation. Sedatives help patients stay relaxed and comfortable. The test can show changes in the lining of the small intestine that can occur with Whipple disease.\n                \nThe health care provider can use tiny tools passed through the endoscope to perform biopsies. A biopsy is a procedure that involves taking a piece of tissue for examination with a microscope. A pathologista doctor who specializes in examining tissues to diagnose diseasesexamines the tissue from the stomach lining in a lab. The pathologist applies a special stain to the tissue and examines it for T. whipplei-infected cells with a microscope. Once the pathologist completes the examination of the tissue, he or she sends a report to the gastroenterologist for review. More information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Upper GI Endoscopy.",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Whipple disease is a rare bacterial infection that affects multiple organ systems, particularly the gastrointestinal tract. The primary treatment for Whipple disease is antibiotic therapy, usually involving intravenous administration of antibiotics such as ceftriaxone or meropenem for at least 2 weeks, followed by oral antibiotics (such as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or doxycycline) for 12 to 18 months. This long-term antibiotic therapy is essential to ensure complete eradication of the bacteria and prevent relapse.\n\nAdditionally, patients with Whipple disease may require nutritional support, as the infection can lead to malabsorption and weight loss. This may involve dietary modifications, vitamin supplementation, and, in severe cases, total parenteral nutrition (TPN).\n\nIt is important to note that follow-up care, including regular monitoring of symptoms and laboratory tests, is crucial to detect any potential relapse or complications early. Patients should work closely with their healthcare providers to develop an individualized treatment plan.",
        "original_answer": "The health care provider prescribes antibiotics to destroy the T. whipplei bacteria and treat Whipple disease. Health care providers choose antibiotics that treat the infection in the small intestine and cross the blood-brain barriera layer of tissue around the brain. Using antibiotics that cross the blood-brain barrier ensures destruction of any bacteria that may have entered the patients brain and central nervous system.\n                \nThe health care provider usually prescribes IV antibiotics for the first 2 weeks of treatment. Most patients feel relief from symptoms within the first week or two. A nurse or technician places an IV in the patients arm to give the antibiotics. IV antibiotics used to treat Whipple disease may include\n                \n- ceftriaxone (Rocephin)  - meropenem (Merrem I.V.)  - penicillin G (Pfizerpen)  - streptomycin (Streptomycin)\n                \nAfter a patient completes the IV antibiotics, the health care provider will prescribe long-term oral antibiotics. Patients receive long-term treatmentat least 1 to 2 yearsto cure the infection anywhere in the body. Oral antibiotics may include\n                \n- trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (Septra, Bactrim)a combination antibiotic  - doxycycline (Vibramycin)\n                \nPatients should finish the prescribed course of antibiotics to ensure the medication destroyed all T. whipplei bacteria in the body. Patients who feel better may still have the bacteria in the small intestine or other areas of the body for 1 to 2 years. A health care provider will monitor the patient closely, repeat the blood tests, and repeat the upper GI endoscopy with biopsy during and after treatment to determine whether T. whipplei is still present.\n                \nPeople may relapse during or after treatment. A health care provider will prescribe additional or new antibiotics if a relapse occurs. Some people will relapse years after treatment, so it is important for patients to schedule routine follow-ups with the health care provider. Most patients have good outcomes with an early diagnosis and complete treatment.\n                \nHealth care providers treat patients with neurologic symptoms at diagnosis or during relapse more aggressively. Treatment may include\n                \n- a combination of antibiotics  - hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil)an antimalarial medication  - weekly injections of interferon gammaa substance made by the body that activates the immune system  - corticosteroidsmedications that decrease inflammation",

Blood tests can also show a high white blood cell count, a sign of chronic inflammation.\n                \n\n                \nYou may also be asked for a stool sample. A stool test is commonly used to rule out other causes of GI diseases, such as infections. The doctor will give you a container for catching and storing the stool. The sample is returned to the doctor or a commercial facility and sent to a lab for analysis. A stool sample can also be used to check if you have bleeding or inflammation.\n                \nOther tests may be needed to diagnose Crohn's disease. The following tests are all performed at a hospital or outpatient center.\n                \n- Colonoscopy. Colonoscopy is the most commonly used test to specifically diagnose Crohns disease. This test is used to look inside your rectum, entire colon, and ileum. The health care provider will give you written bowel prep instructions to follow at home before the test. You may need to follow a clear liquid diet for 1 to 3 days before the test. You will need to take laxatives and enemas the evening before the test, and you will likely have one or more enemas about 2 hours before the test. A laxative is medicine that loosens stool and increases bowel movements. An enema involves flushing water, laxative, or sometimes a mild soap solution into the anus using a special squirt bottle.  For the test, you will lie on a table while the doctor inserts a flexible tube into your anus. A small camera on the tube sends a video image of the intestinal lining to a computer screen. The doctor can see inflammation, ulcers, or bleeding. The doctor may also perform a biopsy. The doctor will look at the tissue with a microscope to confirm the diagnosis of Crohns disease. In most cases, youll be given a light sedative, and possibly pain medicine, to help you relax. You will not feel the biopsy.  Cramping or bloating may occur during the first hour after the test. Driving is not permitted for 24 hours after the test to allow the sedative time to wear off. Before the appointment, you should make plans for a ride home. By the next day, you should fully recover and go back to your normal diet.    - Flexible sigmoidoscopy. This test is used to look inside the rectum and lower colon. The health care provider will give you written bowel prep instructions to follow at home before the test. You may need to follow a clear liquid diet for 1 to 3 days before the test. You may also need a laxative or enema the night before the test. And youll have one or more enemas about 2 hours before the procedure.  For the test, you will lie on a table while the doctor inserts a flexible tube into your anus. You will not need a sedative for the test. A small camera on the tube sends a video image of the intestinal lining to a computer screen. The doctor can see inflammation, ulcers, or bleeding. The doctor may also perform a biopsy by snipping a bit of tissue from the intestinal lining. The doctor will look at the tissue with a microscope to confirm the diagnosis of Crohns disease. You will not feel the biopsy.  You can usually go back to your normal diet after the test, though you may have cramping or bloating during the first hour after the test.    - Computerized tomography (CT) scan. A CT scan uses x rays and computers to create images of the inside of the body. For the test, you will lie on a table that slides into a tunnel-shaped device where the x rays are taken. The technician may give you a solution to drink and an injection of a special dye through a needle inserted into an arm vein. You will not need a sedative for the test. CT scans can be used to help diagnose Crohn's disease.    - Upper GI series (x rays). An upper GI series may be done to look at the small intestine. No eating or drinking is allowed for 8 hours before the procedure. You will not need a sedative for the test. During the procedure, you will stand or sit in front of an x-ray machine and drink barium, a chalky liquid. The barium coats the small intestine, making signs of the disease show up more clearly on x rays.  After the test, you may go back to your normal diet, though you may have nausea or bloating for a short time. Traces of barium in the GI tract cause stools to be white or light colored for a few days after the test.    - Lower GI series (x rays). A lower GI series may be done to look at the large intestine. The health care provider will give you written bowel prep instructions to follow at home before the test. You will be asked to follow a clear liquid diet for 1 to 3 days before the test. A laxative or enema is usually used the evening before a lower GI series. Enemas are sometimes repeated the morning of the test.  For the test, you will lie on a table while the doctor inserts a flexible tube into your anus. You will not need a sedative for the test. The large intestine is filled with barium, making signs of the disease show up more clearly on x rays. After the test, you may go back to your normal diet, though you may have bloating. You also may have some soreness of the anus. Traces of barium in the GI tract cause stools to be white or light colored for a few days after the test.",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Crohn's disease is a type of inflammatory bowel disease that can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract, from the mouth to the anus. Here are some key points to understand about Crohn's disease:\n\n1. Cause: The exact cause of Crohn's disease is unknown, but it is believed to be related to an overactive immune system, genetics, and environmental factors.\n2. Symptoms: Common symptoms include abdominal pain, diarrhea, fatigue, weight loss, and malnutrition. Some people may also experience joint pain, skin rashes, and eye inflammation.\n3. Diagnosis: Crohn's disease is typically diagnosed through a combination of medical history, physical examination, blood tests, stool tests, and imaging studies such as colonoscopy or MRI.\n4. Treatment: There is no cure for Crohn's disease, but treatment can help manage symptoms and prevent complications. Treatment options include medications to reduce inflammation, immune system suppressors, nutritional therapy, and surgery.\n5. Complications: Crohn's disease can lead to serious complications such as bowel obstruction, abscesses, fistulas, and increased risk of colon cancer.\n6. Lifestyle changes: Stress management, regular exercise, and a healthy diet can help manage symptoms and improve quality of life for people with Crohn's disease.\n7. Prognosis: The course of Crohn's disease is unpredictable, with periods of remission and flare-ups. Some people may require frequent hospitalizations and surgeries, while others may have milder symptoms.\n\nIf you suspect you have Crohn's disease, it is important to seek medical attention from a healthcare professional. With proper diagnosis and treatment, it is possible to manage the condition and maintain a good quality of life.",
        "original_answer": "Intestinal blockage can occur in people with Crohns disease when scar tissue blocks the intestinal passage. A narrow intestinal passage is called a stricture. When the passage blocks completely, food and stool stop moving, causing abdominal cramps and vomiting. If you have these symptoms, you should see a health care provider right away.\n                \nUlcers from Crohns disease can cause tunnels to form through the inflamed areas, or even the healthy parts, of the intestine. These tunnels are called fistulas. Fistulas are seen most often in the areas around the rectum and anus. Sometimes a pocket of infection, called an abscess, can form in and around the fistulas. Most fistulas can be treated with medicines, but sometimes surgery is needed.\n                \nPeople with Crohns disease often have anemia, which can be caused by the disease itself or by iron deficiency. Anemia may make a person feel tired.\n                \nPeople with Crohns disease, particularly if they have been treated with steroid medicines, may have weakness of their bonescalled osteoporosis or osteomalacia.\n                \nPeople with Crohns disease may also have arthritis, skin problems, swelling in the eyes or mouth, kidney stones, gallstones, and liver problems. Some people with Crohns disease may have restless legs syndromeextreme leg discomfort the person feels while sitting or lying down. These problems may go away during treatment, but some must be treated with medicines.\n                \nPeople who have Crohns disease may not get enough nutrition, such as protein, vitamins, or calories, because they\n                \n- have an upset stomach that keeps them from eating enough calories  - may not be able to absorb nutrients in the intestine\n                \nChildren with Crohns disease may fail to grow normally and may have low height for their age.",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease that can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract. While there is no cure for Crohn's disease, there are several treatment options available to manage symptoms, reduce inflammation, and maintain remission. Here are some common treatments:\n\n1. Medications: Various medications can be used to treat Crohn's disease, including anti-inflammatory drugs, immunosuppressants, biologic therapies, and antibiotics. The choice of medication depends on the severity and location of the inflammation.\n2. Diet and lifestyle modifications: Certain dietary changes and lifestyle modifications can help alleviate symptoms and reduce inflammation. These may include avoiding trigger foods, eating smaller, more frequent meals, increasing fiber intake, staying hydrated, and managing stress.\n3. Surgery: In severe cases of Crohn's disease, surgery may be necessary to remove damaged portions of the intestine or to treat complications such as obstructions, abscesses, or fistulas. However, surgery is not a cure and the disease may recur in the remaining tissues.\n4. Supportive care: Supportive care measures, such as managing pain, treating anemia, and addressing nutritional deficiencies, can help improve quality of life and overall well-being in individuals with Crohn's disease.\n\nIt's important to work closely with a healthcare provider to develop an individualized treatment plan based on the specific needs and circumstances of each person with Crohn's disease.",
        "original_answer": "Treatment for Crohns disease depends on\n                \n- where the disease is located in the GI tract  - what problems you already have from the disease  - what past treatments you have had for the disease\n                \nThe goals of treatment are to\n                \n- decrease the inflammation  - relieve symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, and rectal bleeding  - correct nutritional problems\n                \nTreatment may include\n                \n- medicines  - surgery  - eating, diet, and nutrition\n                \n\n                \nMedicines\n                \nOne or more of the following medicines may be used to treat Crohns disease:\n                \n- Anti-inflammation medicines may be used first to treat your Crohn's disease. These medicines help lower inflammation in the intestine and relieve the pain and diarrhea. Sometimes anti-inflammation medicines cause side effects, so you should talk with your health care provider about what to expect.  - Steroids also help lower inflammation. Steroids are similar to natural chemicals in the body. However, steroids are used only for a short time because long-term use can lead to serious side effects.  - Immune system suppressors. Azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine work by keeping your immune system from attacking harmless foreign substances. Immune system suppressors also cause side effects, so you should talk with your health care provider about what to expect.  - Biological therapies. Biological therapies are medicines that are given by an injection in the vein, infliximab (Remicade), or an injection in the skin, adalimumab (HUMIRA). Your health care provider may treat you with these medicines if others are not helping to decrease inflammation, or if you have fistulas with abscesses. The goals for using these medicines are to get you better, keep you better, and avoid long-term steroid use.  - Antibiotics. Antibiotics are used to treat bacterial overgrowth in the small intestine caused by stricture, fistulas, or surgery. For this common problem, the doctor may prescribe one or more of the following antibiotics: ampicillin, sulfonamide, cephalosporin, tetracycline, or metronidazole.\n                \n\n                \n- Anti-diarrheal medicines and fluid replacements. Diarrhea and abdominal cramps are often relieved when the inflammation improves, but more medicine may be needed. Anti-diarrheal medicines include diphenoxylate, loperamide, and codeine. People with diarrhea should drink plenty of fluids to prevent dehydrationloss of fluids from the body. If diarrhea does not improve, the person should see the doctor promptly for possible treatment with fluids given through a small tube inserted into an arm vein.\n                \nSurgery\n                \nSome people with Crohns disease need surgery if medicines are no longer working to control blockage, fistulas, abscesses, and bleeding. A surgeon performs the procedure in a hospital, where you will receive medicine to make you sleep during the surgery.\n                \nOne or more of the following surgeries may be needed:\n                \n- Intestinal resection. The surgeon removes the diseased section of intestine and puts the ends of the intestine back together.  - Proctocolectomy. Proctocolectomy is surgery to remove the rectum and part or all of the colon. An ileostomy is performed with a proctocolectomy.  - Ileostomy. Ileostomy is an operation to create an openingcalled a stomafor the stool to exit the body when the ends of the intestine cannot be put back together. To create a stoma, an end of the intestine is brought out through a small opening made on the lower right part of the abdomen near the beltline. The stoma is about the size of a quarter. An ostomy pouch is worn outside the body over the stoma to collect waste, and it is emptied several times a day. Your health care provider may refer you to an ostomy nursea specialist who cares for people with an ostomy pouch.\n                \nSurgery usually does not cure Crohn's disease forever. Sometimes you need to have more than one surgery because the disease returns next to where the intestine was removed. Because Crohns disease can return after surgery, you can talk with your health care provider and other patients to get as much information as possible before having surgery.",

        "original_answer": "Diarrhea is frequent, loose, and watery bowel movements. Bowel movements, also called stools, are body wastes passed through the rectum and anus. Stools contain what is left after your digestive system absorbs nutrients and fluids from what you eat and drink. If your body does not absorb the fluids, or if your digestive system produces extra fluids, stools will be loose and watery. Loose stools contain more water, salts, and minerals and weigh more than solid stools.\n                \nDiarrhea that lasts a short time is called acute diarrhea. Acute diarrhea is a common problem and usually lasts only 1 or 2 days, but it may last longer. Diarrhea that lasts for at least 4 weeks is called chronic diarrhea. Chronic diarrhea symptoms may be continual or they may come and go.\n                \n*See the Pronunciation Guide for tips on how to say the words in bold type.",

This gene is responsible for producing a protein that helps regulate copper levels in the body. When it's not functioning properly, copper can build up in the body, leading to damage in the liver, brain, and other organs. It's important to note that you can only inherit this disease if both of your parents are carriers of the mutated gene, but not all people who inherit the mutation will develop the disease.",
        "original_answer": "Wilson disease is caused by an inherited autosomal recessive mutation, or change, in the ATP7B gene. In an autosomal recessive disease, the child has to inherit the gene mutation from both parents to have an increased likelihood for the disease. The chance of a child inheriting autosomal recessive mutations from both parents with a gene mutation is 25 percent, or one in four. If only one parent carries the mutated gene, the child will not get the disease, although the child may inherit one copy of the gene mutation. The child is called a carrier of the disease and can pass the gene mutation to the next generation. Genetic testing is a procedure that identifies changes in a patients genes and can show whether a parent or child is a carrier of a mutated gene. Autosomal recessive diseases are typically not seen in every generation of an affected family.\n                \nThe following chart shows the chance of inheriting an autosomal recessive mutation from parents who both carry the mutated gene.\n                \n\n                \nGenetic Diseases   Each cell contains thousands of genes that provide the instructions for making proteins for growth and repair of the body. If a gene has a mutation, the protein made by that gene may not function properly. Not all gene mutations cause a disease.   People have two copies of most genes; they inherit one copy from each parent. A genetic disease occurs when one or both parents pass a mutated gene to a child at conception. A genetic disease can also occur through a spontaneous gene mutation, meaning neither parent carries a copy of the mutated gene. Once a spontaneous gene mutation has occurred in a person, that person can pass the gene mutation on to a child.

        "original_answer": "A health care provider may use several tests and exams to diagnose Wilson disease, including the following:\n                \n- medical and family history  - physical exam  - blood tests  - urine tests  - liver biopsy  - imaging tests\n                \nHealth care providers typically see the same symptoms of Wilson disease in other conditions, and the symptoms of Wilson disease do not occur together often, making the disease difficult to diagnose.\n                \nMedical and Family History\n                \nA health care provider may take a medical and family history to help diagnose Wilson disease.\n                \nPhysical Exam\n                \nA physical exam may help diagnose Wilson disease. During a physical exam, a health care provider usually\n                \n- examines a patients body  - uses a stethoscope to listen to sounds related to the abdomen\n                \nA health care provider will use a special light called a slit lamp to look for Kayser-Fleischer rings in the eyes.\n                \nBlood Tests\n                \nA nurse or technician will draw blood samples at a health care providers office or a commercial facility and send the samples to a lab for analysis. A health care provider may\n                \n- perform liver enzyme or function testsblood tests that may indicate liver abnormalities.  - check copper levels in the blood. Since the copper is deposited into the organs and is not circulating in the blood, most people with Wilson disease have a lower-than-normal level of copper in the blood. In cases of acute liver failure caused by Wilson disease, the level of blood copper is often higher than normal.  - check the level of ceruloplasmina protein that carries copper in the bloodstream. Most people with Wilson disease have a lower-than-normal ceruloplasmin level.  - conduct genetic testing. A health care provider may recommend genetic testing in cases of a known family history of Wilson disease.\n                \nUrine Tests\n                \n24-hour urine collection. A patient will collect urine at home in a special container provided by a health care providers office or a commercial facility. A health care provider sends the sample to a lab for analysis. A 24-hour urine collection will show increased copper in the urine in most patients who have symptoms due to Wilson disease.\n                \nLiver Biopsy\n                \nA liver biopsy is a procedure that involves taking a small piece of liver tissue for examination with a microscope for signs of damage or disease. The health care provider may ask the patient to stop taking certain medications temporarily before the liver biopsy. He or she may also ask the patient to fasteat or drink nothingfor 8 hours before the procedure.\n                \nDuring the procedure, the patient lies on a table, right hand resting above the head. The health care provider applies a local anesthetic to the area where he or she will insert the biopsy needle. If needed, a health care provider will also give sedatives and pain medication. The health care provider uses the needle to take a small piece of liver tissue. He or she may use ultrasound, computerized tomography scans, or other imaging techniques to guide the needle. After the biopsy, the patient must lie on the right side for up to 2 hours and is monitored an additional 2 to 4 hours before being sent home.\n                \nA pathologista doctor who specializes in diagnosing diseasesexamines the liver tissue in a lab. The test can show cirrhosis of the liver. Sometimes the liver biopsy will show copper buildup in the liver cells; however, the results can vary because the copper does not always deposit evenly into the liver. Therefore, health care providers often find it more useful to analyze a piece of liver tissue for copper content. Most patients with Wilson disease have high levels of copper in the liver tissue when compared with carriers or with people who do not have Wilson disease.\n                \nMore information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Liver Biopsy.\n                \nImaging Tests\n                \nA health care provider may order imaging tests to evaluate brain abnormalities in patients who have nervous system symptoms often seen with Wilson disease, or in patients diagnosed with Wilson disease. Health care providers do not use brain imaging tests to diagnose Wilson disease, though certain findings may suggest the patient has the disease.\n                \nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI). An MRI is a test that takes pictures of the bodys internal organs and soft tissues without using x rays. A specially trained technician performs the procedure in an outpatient center or a hospital, and a radiologista doctor who specializes in medical imaginginterprets the images. The patient does not need anesthesia, though people with a fear of confined spaces may receive light sedation, taken by mouth. An MRI may include the injection of a special dye, called contrast medium. With most MRI machines, the patient will lie on a table that slides into a tunnel-shaped device that may be open ended or closed at one end. Some machines allow the patient to lie in a more open space. The technician will take a sequence of images from different angles to create a detailed picture of the brain. During sequencing, the patient will hear loud mechanical knocking and humming noises. MRI can show if other diseases or conditions are causing the patients neurological symptoms.\n                \nComputerized tomography (CT) scan. A CT scan uses a combination of x rays and computer technology to create images. For a CT scan, a health care provider may give the patient a solution to drink and an injection of contrast medium. CT scans require the patient to lie on a table that slides into a tunnel-shaped device where a technician takes the x rays. An x-ray technician performs the procedure in an outpatient center or a hospital. A radiologist interprets the images. The patient does not need anesthesia. A CT scan can show if other diseases or conditions are causing the patients neurological symptoms.",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Wilson disease is a genetic disorder that affects copper metabolism. The main treatments for Wilson disease are:\n\n1. Medications: The most common medications used to treat Wilson disease are D-penicillamine and trientine, which help remove excess copper from the body. Zinc acetate is another medication that can be used to prevent the body from absorbing too much copper.\n2. Dietary modifications: Avoiding foods that are high in copper, such as shellfish, nuts, chocolate, and dried fruits, can help reduce copper intake.\n3. Regular monitoring: Regular monitoring of blood, urine, and liver function tests is important to ensure that treatment is effective and to detect any potential complications.\n4. Liver transplantation: In severe cases of Wilson disease, a liver transplant may be necessary to replace the damaged liver with a healthy one that can properly metabolize copper.\n\nIt is important to note that early diagnosis and treatment of Wilson disease can help prevent serious complications and improve long-term outcomes.",
        "original_answer": "A health care provider will treat Wilson disease with a lifelong effort to reduce and control the amount of copper in the body. Treatment may include\n                \n- medications  - changes in eating, diet, and nutrition  - a liver transplant\n                \nMedications\n                \nA health care provider will prescribe medications to treat Wilson disease. The medications have different actions that health care providers use during different phases of the treatment.\n                \nChelating agents. Chelating agents are medications that remove extra copper from the body by releasing it from organs into the bloodstream. Once the cooper is in the bloodstream, the kidneys then filter the copper and pass it into the urine. A health care provider usually recommends chelating agents at the beginning of treatment. A potential side effect of chelating agents is that nervous system symptoms may become worse during treatment. The two medications available for this type of treatment include\n                \n- trientine (Syprine)the risk for side effects and worsening nervous system symptoms appears to be lower with trientine than d-penicillamine. Researchers are still studying the side effects; however, some health care providers prefer to prescribe trientine as the first treatment of choice because it appears to be safer.  - d-penicillaminepeople taking d-penicillamine may have other reactions or side effects, such as      - fever    - a rash    - kidney problems    - bone marrow problems\n                \nA health care provider will prescribe a lower dose of a chelating agent to women who are pregnant to reduce the risk of birth defects. A health care provider should consider future screening on any newborn whose parent has Wilson disease.\n                \nZinc. A health care provider will prescribe zinc for patients who do not have symptoms, or after a person has completed successful treatment using a chelating agent and symptoms begin to improve. Zinc, taken by mouth as zinc salts such as zinc acetate (Galzin), blocks the digestive tracts absorption of copper from food. Although most people taking zinc usually do not experience side effects, some people may experience stomach upset. A health care provider may prescribe zinc for children with Wilson disease who show no symptoms. Women may take the full dosage of zinc safely during pregnancy.\n                \nMaintenance, or long term, treatment begins when symptoms improve and tests show that copper is at a safe level. Maintenance treatment typically includes taking zinc or a lower dose of a chelating agent. A health care provider closely monitors the person and reviews regular blood and urine tests to ensure maintenance treatment controls the copper level in the body.\n                \nTreatment for people with Wilson disease who have no symptoms may include a chelating agent or zinc in order to prevent symptoms from developing and stop or slow disease progression.\n                \nPeople with Wilson disease will take medications for the rest of their lives. Follow-up and adherence to the health care providers treatment plan is necessary to manage symptoms and prevent organ damage.",

        "original_answer": "The thyroid is a 2-inch-long, butterfly-shaped gland weighing less than 1 ounce. Located in the front of the neck below the larynx, or voice box, it has two lobes, one on each side of the windpipe. The thyroid is one of the glands that make up the endocrine system. The glands of the endocrine system produce, store, and release hormones into the bloodstream. The hormones then travel through the body and direct the activity of the bodys cells.\n                \nThe thyroid gland makes two thyroid hormones, triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4). T3 is made from T4 and is the more active hormone, directly affecting the tissues. Thyroid hormones affect metabolism, brain development, breathing, heart and nervous system functions, body temperature, muscle strength, skin dryness, menstrual cycles, weight, and cholesterol levels.\n                \nThyroid hormone production is regulated by thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), which is made by the pituitary gland in the brain. When thyroid hormone levels in the blood are low, the pituitary releases more TSH. When thyroid hormone levels are high, the pituitary responds by decreasing TSH production.",

This can be due to various conditions such as Graves' disease, toxic adenoma, Plummer's disease, or thyroiditis. Excessive iodine or certain medications can also lead to hyperthyroidism.",
        "original_answer": "Hyperthyroidism has several causes, including\n                \n- Graves disease  - thyroid nodules  - thyroiditis, or inflammation of the thyroid  - consuming too much iodine  - overmedicating with synthetic thyroid hormone, which is used to treat underactive thyroid\n                \nRarely, hyperthyroidism is caused by a pituitary adenoma, which is a noncancerous tumor of the pituitary gland. In this case, hyperthyroidism is due to too much TSH.\n                \nGraves Disease\n                \nGraves disease, also known as toxic diffuse goiter, is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism in the United States. Graves disease is an autoimmune disorder. Normally, the immune system protects the body from infection by identifying and destroying bacteria, viruses, and other potentially harmful foreign substances. But in autoimmune diseases, the immune system attacks the bodys own cells and organs.\n                \nWith Graves disease, the immune system makes an antibody called thyroid stimulating immunoglobulin (TSI) that attaches to thyroid cells. TSI mimics the action of TSH and stimulates the thyroid to make too much thyroid hormone.\n                \nMore information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Graves' disease.\n                \nThyroid Nodules\n                \nThyroid nodules, also called adenomas, are lumps in the thyroid. Thyroid nodules are common and usually noncancerous. About 3 to 7 percent of the U.S. population has them.2 However, nodules may become overactive and produce too much hormone.\n                \nA single overactive nodule is called a toxic adenoma. Multiple overactive nodules are called toxic multinodular goiter. Often found in older adults, toxic multinodular goiter can produce a large amount of excess thyroid hormone.\n                \nThyroiditis\n                \nThyroiditis is an inflammation of the thyroid that causes stored thyroid hormone to leak out of the thyroid gland. At first, the leakage raises hormone levels in the blood, leading to hyperthyroidism that lasts for 1 or 2 months. Most people then develop hypothyroidismwhen thyroid hormone levels are too lowbefore the thyroid is completely healed.\n                \nSeveral types of thyroiditis can cause hyperthyroidism followed by hypothyroidism:\n                \n- Subacute thyroiditis. This condition involves painful inflammation and enlargement of the thyroid. Experts are not sure what causes subacute thyroiditis, but it may be related to a viral or bacterial infection. The condition usually goes away on its own in a few months.  - Postpartum thyroiditis. This type of thyroiditis develops after a woman gives birth. For more information, see the section titled What happens with pregnancy and thyroid conditions?  - Silent thyroiditis. This type of thyroiditis is called silent because it is painless, as is postpartum thyroiditis, even though the thyroid may be enlarged. Like postpartum thyroiditis, silent thyroiditis is probably an autoimmune condition and sometimes develops into permanent hypothyroidism.\n                \nConsuming Too Much Iodine\n                \nThe thyroid uses iodine to make thyroid hormone, so the amount of iodine consumed influences the amount of thyroid hormone the thyroid makes. In some people, consuming large amounts of iodine may cause the thyroid to make excess thyroid hormone.\n                \nSometimes significant amounts of iodine are contained in medicationssuch as amiodarone, which is used to treat heart problemsor in supplements containing seaweed. Some cough syrups also contain large amounts of iodine. See Eating, Diet, and Nutrition for more information on iodine.\n                \nOvermedicating with Synthetic Thyroid Hormone\n                \nSome people who take synthetic thyroid hormone for hypothyroidism may take too much. People who take synthetic thyroid hormone should see their health care provider at least once a year to have their thyroid hormone levels checked and follow the health care providers instructions about the dosage.\n                \nSome other medications may also interact with synthetic thyroid hormone to raise hormone levels in the blood. People who take synthetic thyroid hormone should ask their health care provider about interactions when starting new medications.",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Hyperthyroidism is diagnosed through a combination of medical history, physical examination, and laboratory tests. During the medical history, the doctor will ask about symptoms such as weight loss, rapid heart rate, and tremors. During the physical examination, the doctor may check for a rapid heart rate, tremors, and enlargement of the thyroid gland.\n\nLaboratory tests are used to confirm the diagnosis and determine the severity of the condition. These tests may include:\n\n1. TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) test: This is often the first test performed. Low levels of TSH indicate that the thyroid gland is overactive.\n2. T3 and T4 tests: These tests measure the levels of the thyroid hormones triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) in the blood. High levels of these hormones indicate hyperthyroidism.\n3. Thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin (TSI) test: This test measures the presence of antibodies that can stimulate the thyroid gland, leading to hyperthyroidism.\n4. Radioactive iodine uptake (RAIU) test: This test measures how much iodine the thyroid gland absorbs. High levels of iodine uptake can indicate hyperthyroidism.\n\nIt is important to consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan.",
        "original_answer": "Many symptoms of hyperthyroidism are the same as those of other diseases, so hyperthyroidism usually cannot be diagnosed based on symptoms alone. With suspected hyperthyroidism, health care providers take a medical history and perform a thorough physical exam. Health care providers may then use several blood tests, such as the following, to confirm a diagnosis of hyperthyroidism and find its cause:\n                \nTSH test. The ultrasensitive TSH test is usually the first test a health care provider performs. This test detects even tiny amounts of TSH in the blood and is the most accurate measure of thyroid activity available. The TSH test is especially useful in detecting mild hyperthyroidism. Generally, a TSH reading below normal means a person has hyperthyroidism and a reading above normal means a person has hypothyroidism.\n                \nHealth care providers may conduct additional tests to help confirm the diagnosis or determine the cause of hyperthyroidism.\n                \nT3 and T4 test. This test shows the levels of T3 and T4 in the blood. With hyperthyroidism, the levels of one or both of these hormones in the blood are higher than normal.\n                \nThyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin (TSI) test. This test, also called a thyroidstimulating antibody test, measures the level of TSI in the blood. Most people with Graves disease have this antibody, but people whose hyperthyroidism is caused by other conditions do not.\n                \nRadioactive iodine uptake test. The radioactive iodine uptake test measures the amount of iodine the thyroid collects from the bloodstream. Measuring the amount of iodine in a persons thyroid helps the health care provider determine what is causing a persons hyperthyroidism. For example, low levels of iodine uptake might be a sign of thyroiditis, whereas high levels could indicate Graves disease.\n                \nThyroid scan. A thyroid scan shows how and where iodine is distributed in the thyroid. The images of nodules and other possible irregularities help the health care provider diagnose the cause of a persons hyperthyroidism.\n                \nMore information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Thyroid Tests.",

        "question_text": "What are the treatments for Hyperthyroidism ?",
        "llm_vanilla_answer": "There are several treatment options for hyperthyroidism:\n\n1. Anti-thyroid medications: These drugs block the production of thyroid hormones. Propylthiouracil and methimazole are the most commonly used medications.\n2. Radioactive iodine therapy: This treatment involves swallowing a pill or liquid that contains a small amount of radioactive iodine. The radioactive iodine is taken up by the thyroid gland and destroys overactive thyroid cells.\n3. Beta blockers: These medications can help relieve symptoms of hyperthyroidism, such as a rapid heartbeat, tremors, and anxiety.\n4. Surgery: In some cases, surgery to remove the thyroid gland (thyroidectomy) may be recommended. This is usually done if other treatments are not effective or if there are complications.\n\nIt's important to discuss the benefits and risks of each treatment option with your doctor to determine the best approach for your individual situation.",
        "original_answer": "Health care providers treat hyperthyroidism with medications, radioiodine therapy, or thyroid surgery. The aim of treatment is to bring thyroid hormone levels to a normal state, thus preventing long-term complications, and to relieve uncomfortable symptoms. No single treatment works for everyone.\n                \nTreatment depends on the cause of hyperthyroidism and how severe it is. When choosing a treatment, health care providers consider a patients age, possible allergies to or side effects of the medications, other conditions such as pregnancy or heart disease, and the availability of an experienced thyroid surgeon.\n                \nFinding the right specialist for treatment is an important first step. Some professional societies, listed under For More Information, and endocrinology departments in local teaching hospitals can provide the names of local specialists.\n                \nMedications\n                \nBeta blockers. Health care providers may prescribe a medication called a beta blocker to reduce symptoms until other treatments take effect. Beta blockers act quickly to relieve many of the symptoms of hyperthyroidism, such as tremors, rapid heartbeat, and nervousness, but do not stop thyroid hormone production. Most people feel better within hours of taking these medications.\n                \nAntithyroid medications. Antithyroid therapy is the easiest way to treat hyperthyroidism. Antithyroid medications interfere with thyroid hormone production but dont usually have permanent results. Antithyroid medications are not used to treat thyroiditis.\n                \nOnce treatment with antithyroid medications begins, thyroid hormone levels may not move into the normal range for several weeks or months. The average treatment time is about 1 to 2 years, but treatment can continue for many years.\n                \nAntithyroid medications can cause side effects in some people, including\n                \n- allergic reactions such as rashes and itching  - a decrease in the number of white blood cells in the body, which can lower resistance to infection  - liver failure, in rare cases\n                \nStop your antithyroid medication and call your health care provider right away if you develop any of the following while taking antithyroid medications:   - fatigue   - weakness   - vague abdominal pain   - loss of appetite   - skin rash or itching   - easy bruising   - yellowing of the skin or whites of the eyes, called jaundice   - persistent sore throat   - fever\n                \nIn the United States, health care providers prescribe the antithyroid medication methimazole (Tapazole, Northyx) for most types of hyperthyroidism.\n                \nAntithyroid medications and pregnancy. Because pregnant and breastfeeding women cannot receive radioiodine therapy, they are usually treated with an antithyroid medication instead. However, experts agree that women in their first trimester of pregnancy should not take methimazole due to the rare occurrence of damage to the fetus. Another antithyroid medication, propylthiouracil (PTU), is available for women in this stage of pregnancy or for women who are allergic to or intolerant of methimazole and have no other treatment options.\n                \nHealth care providers may prescribe PTU for the first trimester of pregnancy and switch to methimazole for the second and third trimesters. Some women are able to stop taking antithyroid medications in the last 4 to 8 weeks of pregnancy due to the remission of hyperthyroidism that occurs during pregnancy. However these women should continue to be monitored for recurrence of thyroid problems following delivery.\n                \nStudies have shown that mothers taking antithyroid medications may safely breastfeed. However, they should take only moderate doses, less than 1020 milligrams daily, of the antithyroid medication methimazole. Doses should be divided and taken after feedings, and the infants should be monitored for side effects.4\n                \nWomen requiring higher doses of the antithyroid medication to control hyperthyroidism should not breastfeed.\n                \nRadioiodine Therapy\n                \nRadioactive iodine-131 is a common and effective treatment for hyperthyroidism. In radioiodine therapy, patients take radioactive iodine-131 by mouth. Because the thyroid gland collects iodine to make thyroid hormone, it will collect the radioactive iodine from the bloodstream in the same way. The radioactive iodine gradually destroys the cells that make up the thyroid gland but does not affect other body tissues.\n                \nMore than one round of radioiodine therapy may be needed to bring thyroid hormone production into the normal range. In the meantime, treatment with beta blockers can control symptoms.\n                \nAlmost everyone who receives radioactive iodine treatment eventually develops hypothyroidism. But health care providers consider this an acceptable outcome because hypothyroidism is easier to treat and has fewer long-term complications than hyperthyroidism. People who develop hypothyroidism must take synthetic thyroid hormone.\n                \nRadioiodine and pregnancy. Although iodine-131 is not known to cause birth defects or infertility, radioiodine therapy is not used in pregnant women or women who are breastfeeding. Radioactive iodine can be harmful to the fetus thyroid and can be passed from mother to child in breast milk. Experts recommend that women wait a year after treatment before becoming pregnant.\n                \nThyroid Surgery\n                \nThe least-used treatment is surgery to remove part or most of the thyroid gland. Sometimes surgery may be used to treat\n                \n- pregnant women who cannot tolerate antithyroid medications  - people with large goiters  - people who have cancerous thyroid nodules, though hyperthyroidism does not cause cancer\n                \nBefore surgery, the health care provider may prescribe antithyroid medications to temporarily bring a patients thyroid hormone levels into the normal range. This presurgical treatment prevents a condition called thyroid storma sudden, severe worsening of symptomsthat can occur when hyperthyroid patients have general anesthesia.\n                \nWhen part of the thyroid is removedas a treatment for toxic nodules, for examplethyroid hormone levels may return to normal. But some surgical patients may still develop hypothyroidism and need to take synthetic thyroxine, a medication that is identical to the hormone, T4, made by the thyroid. If the entire thyroid is removed, lifelong thyroid hormone medication is necessary. After surgery, health care providers will continue to monitor patients thyroid hormone levels.\n                \nAlthough uncommon, certain problems can occur in thyroid surgery. The parathyroid glands can be damaged because they are located very close to the thyroid. These glands help control calcium and phosphorus levels in the body. Damage to the laryngeal nerve, also located close to the thyroid, can lead to voice changes or breathing problems. But when surgery is performed by an experienced surgeon, less than 1 percent of patients have permanent complications.5 People who need help finding a surgeon can contact one of the organizations listed under For More Information.",

        "original_answer": "- Hyperthyroidism is a disorder that occurs when the thyroid gland makes more thyroid hormone than the body needs.  - Hyperthyroidism is most often caused by Graves disease, an autoimmune disorder. Other causes include thyroid nodules, thyroiditis, consuming too much iodine, and overmedicating with synthetic thyroid hormone.  - Some symptoms of hyperthyroidism are nervousness or irritability, fatigue or muscle weakness, heat intolerance, trouble sleeping, hand tremors, rapid and irregular heartbeat, frequent bowel movements or diarrhea, weight loss, mood swings, and goiter.  - Hyperthyroidism is much more common in women than men.  - Hyperthyroidism is also more common in people older than age 60 and is often caused by thyroid nodules. Hyperthyroidism in this age group is sometimes misdiagnosed as depression or dementia. For people older than age 60, subclinical hyperthyroidism increases their chance of developing atrial fibrillation.  - Women with hyperthyroidism should discuss their condition with their health care provider before becoming pregnant.  - Hyperthyroidism is treated with medications, radioiodine therapy, or thyroid surgery.

Autonomic neuropathy, which affects the autonomic nervous system, which controls your heart, bladder, stomach, intestines, sex organs, and eyes.\n3. Focal neuropathy, which affects specific nerves, most often in the head, torso, or leg.\n4. Proximal neuropathy, which affects nerves in the hips, buttocks, or thighs.\n\nSymptoms can include tingling, numbness, burning or pain, sensitivity to touch, muscle weakness, loss of balance and coordination, and serious foot problems.\n\nIf you have diabetes, it's important to control your blood sugar levels, maintain a healthy lifestyle, and get regular check-ups to prevent or manage diabetic neuropathy.",
        "original_answer": "Peripheral neuropathy, also called distal symmetric neuropathy or sensorimotor neuropathy, is nerve damage in the arms and legs. Feet and legs are likely to be affected before hands and arms. Many people with diabetes have signs of neuropathy that a doctor could note but feel no symptoms themselves. Symptoms of peripheral neuropathy may include\n                \n- numbness or insensitivity to pain or temperature  - a tingling, burning, or prickling sensation  - sharp pains or cramps  - extreme sensitivity to touch, even light touch  - loss of balance and coordination\n                \nThese symptoms are often worse at night.\n                \nPeripheral neuropathy may also cause muscle weakness and loss of reflexes, especially at the ankle, leading to changes in the way a person walks. Foot deformities, such as hammertoes and the collapse of the midfoot, may occur. Blisters and sores may appear on numb areas of the foot because pressure or injury goes unnoticed. If an infection occurs and is not treated promptly, the infection may spread to the bone, and the foot may then have to be amputated. Many amputations are preventable if minor problems are caught and treated in time.",

        "original_answer": "Autonomic neuropathy affects the nerves that control the heart, regulate blood pressure, and control blood glucose levels. Autonomic neuropathy also affects other internal organs, causing problems with digestion, respiratory function, urination, sexual response, and vision. In addition, the system that restores blood glucose levels to normal after a hypoglycemic episode may be affected, resulting in loss of the warning symptoms of hypoglycemia.\n                \nHypoglycemia Unawareness\n                \nNormally, symptoms such as shakiness, sweating, and palpitations occur when blood glucose levels drop below 70 mg/dL. In people with autonomic neuropathy, symptoms may not occur, making hypoglycemia difficult to recognize. Problems other than neuropathy can also cause hypoglycemia unawareness.\n                \nHeart and Blood Vessels\n                \nThe heart and blood vessels are part of the cardiovascular system, which controls blood circulation. Damage to nerves in the cardiovascular system interferes with the body's ability to adjust blood pressure and heart rate. As a result, blood pressure may drop sharply after sitting or standing, causing a person to feel light-headed or even to faint. Damage to the nerves that control heart rate can mean that the heart rate stays high, instead of rising and falling in response to normal body functions and physical activity.\n                \nDigestive System\n                \nNerve damage to the digestive system most commonly causes constipation. Damage can also cause the stomach to empty too slowly, a condition called gastroparesis. Severe gastroparesis can lead to persistent nausea and vomiting, bloating, and loss of appetite. Gastroparesis can also make blood glucose levels fluctuate widely, due to abnormal food digestion.\n                \nNerve damage to the esophagus may make swallowing difficult, while nerve damage to the bowels can cause constipation alternating with frequent, uncontrolled diarrhea, especially at night. Problems with the digestive system can lead to weight loss.\n                \nUrinary Tract and Sex Organs\n                \nAutonomic neuropathy often affects the organs that control urination and sexual function. Nerve damage can prevent the bladder from emptying completely, allowing bacteria to grow in the bladder and kidneys and causing urinary tract infections. When the nerves of the bladder are damaged, urinary incontinence may result because a person may not be able to sense when the bladder is full or control the muscles that release urine.\n                \nAutonomic neuropathy can also gradually decrease sexual response in men and women, although the sex drive may be unchanged. A man may be unable to have erections or may reach sexual climax without ejaculating normally. A woman may have difficulty with arousal, lubrication, or orgasm.\n                \nSweat Glands\n                \nAutonomic neuropathy can affect the nerves that control sweating. When nerve damage prevents the sweat glands from working properly, the body cannot regulate its temperature as it should. Nerve damage can also cause profuse sweating at night or while eating.\n                \nEyes\n                \nFinally, autonomic neuropathy can affect the pupils of the eyes, making them less responsive to changes in light. As a result, a person may not be able to see well when a light is turned on in a dark room or may have trouble driving at night.",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Diabetic neuropathies are typically diagnosed through a combination of methods:\n\n1. Medical History: The doctor will ask about symptoms, their duration, and how they affect daily life.\n\n2. Physical Examination: This includes checking blood pressure, heart rate, muscle strength, reflexes, and sensitivity to touch, temperature, and vibration.\n\n3. Nerve Function Tests: These may include:\n\n   - Nerve Conduction Studies (NCS): This measures the speed at which nerves send electrical signals.\n   - Electromyography (EMG): This measures the response of muscles to electrical signals.\n   - Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST): This measures the ability to feel vibrations, temperature changes, and light touch.\n\n4. Autonomic Tests: These measure the function of the autonomic nervous system, which controls involuntary functions like heart rate, blood pressure, and digestion.\n\n5. Laboratory Tests: These may include blood tests to check blood sugar levels, A1C (average blood sugar over the past 2-3 months), and kidney and thyroid function.\n\n6. Imaging Tests: These may include MRI or CT scans to check for other causes of nerve damage.\n\nRemember, it's important to manage blood sugar levels to prevent or slow the progression of diabetic neuropathies. If you suspect you have nerve damage, consult with a healthcare professional.",
        "original_answer": "Doctors diagnose neuropathy on the basis of symptoms and a physical exam. During the exam, the doctor may check blood pressure, heart rate, muscle strength, reflexes, and sensitivity to position changes, vibration, temperature, or light touch.\n                \nFoot Exams\n                \nExperts recommend that people with diabetes have a comprehensive foot exam each year to check for peripheral neuropathy. People diagnosed with peripheral neuropathy need more frequent foot exams. A comprehensive foot exam assesses the skin, muscles, bones, circulation, and sensation of the feet. The doctor may assess protective sensation or feeling in the feet by touching them with a nylon monofilamentsimilar to a bristle on a hairbrushattached to a wand or by pricking them with a pin. People who cannot sense pressure from a pinprick or monofilament have lost protective sensation and are at risk for developing foot sores that may not heal properly. The doctor may also check temperature perception or use a tuning fork, which is more sensitive than touch pressure, to assess vibration perception.\n                \nOther Tests\n                \nThe doctor may perform other tests as part of the diagnosis.\n                \n- Nerve conduction studies or electromyography are sometimes used to help determine the type and extent of nerve damage. Nerve conduction studies check the transmission of electrical current through a nerve. Electromyography shows how well muscles respond to electrical signals transmitted by nearby nerves. These tests are rarely needed to diagnose neuropathy.  - A check of heart rate variability shows how the heart responds to deep breathing and to changes in blood pressure and posture.  - Ultrasound uses sound waves to produce an image of internal organs. An ultrasound of the bladder and other parts of the urinary tract, for example, can be used to assess the structure of these organs and show whether the bladder empties completely after urination.",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Diabetic neuropathies, or nerve damage caused by diabetes, can be treated through a combination of methods:\n\n1. **Tight Blood Sugar Control:** Maintaining near-normal blood sugar levels can help slow the progression of nerve damage.\n\n2. **Pain Management:** Various medications, such as painkillers, antidepressants, and anti-seizure drugs, can help manage the pain associated with diabetic neuropathies.\n\n3. **Physical Therapy:** This can help manage symptoms like weakness, balance problems, and pain.\n\n4. **Lifestyle Changes:** Regular exercise, a healthy diet, quitting smoking, and limiting alcohol can all help manage symptoms and slow the progression of nerve damage.\n\n5. **Addressing Underlying Conditions:** Treating conditions like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and infection can help prevent further nerve damage.\n\n6. **In severe cases:** Surgery may be required to relieve nerve compression or to address issues with the digestive system, urinary system, or sex organs caused by nerve damage.\n\nRemember, it's important to work closely with your healthcare provider to develop a treatment plan that's right for you.",
        "original_answer": "The first treatment step is to bring blood glucose levels within the normal range to help prevent further nerve damage. Blood glucose monitoring, meal planning, physical activity, and diabetes medicines or insulin will help control blood glucose levels. Symptoms may get worse when blood glucose is first brought under control, but over time, maintaining lower blood glucose levels helps lessen symptoms. Good blood glucose control may also help prevent or delay the onset of further problems. As scientists learn more about the underlying causes of neuropathy, new treatments may become available to help slow, prevent, or even reverse nerve damage.\n                \nAs described in the following sections, additional treatment depends on the type of nerve problem and symptom.\n                \nPain Relief\n                \nDoctors usually treat painful diabetic neuropathy with oral medications, although other types of treatments may help some people. People with severe nerve pain may benefit from a combination of medications or treatments and should consider talking with a health care provider about treatment options.\n                \nMedications used to help relieve diabetic nerve pain include\n                \n- tricyclic antidepressants, such as amitriptyline, imipramine, and desipramine (Norpramin, Pertofrane)  - other types of antidepressants, such as duloxetine (Cymbalta), venlafaxine, bupropion (Wellbutrin), paroxetine (Paxil), and citalopram (Celexa)  - anticonvulsants, such as pregabalin (Lyrica), gabapentin (Gabarone, Neurontin), carbamazepine, and lamotrigine (Lamictal)  - opioids and opioidlike drugs, such as controlled-release oxycodone, an opioid; and tramadol (Ultram), an opioid that also acts as an antidepressant\n                \nDuloxetine and pregabalin are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration specifically for treating painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy.\n                \nPeople do not have to be depressed for an antidepressant to help relieve their nerve pain. All medications have side effects, and some are not recommended for use in older adults or those with heart disease. Because over-the-counter pain medicines such as acetaminophen and ibuprofen may not work well for treating most nerve pain and can have serious side effects, some experts recommend avoiding these medications.\n                \nTreatments that are applied to the skintypically to the feetinclude capsaicin cream and lidocaine patches (Lidoderm, Lidopain). Studies suggest that nitrate sprays or patches for the feet may relieve pain. Studies of alpha-lipoic acid, an antioxidant, and evening primrose oil suggest they may help relieve symptoms and improve nerve function in some patients.\n                \nA device called a bed cradle can keep sheets and blankets from touching sensitive feet and legs. Acupuncture, biofeedback, or physical therapy may help relieve pain in some people. Treatments that involve electrical nerve stimulation, magnetic therapy, and laser or light therapy may be helpful but need further study. Researchers are also studying several new therapies in clinical trials.\n                \nGastrointestinal Problems\n                \nTo relieve mild symptoms of gastroparesisindigestion, belching, nausea, or vomitingdoctors suggest eating small, frequent meals; avoiding fats; and eating less fiber. When symptoms are severe, doctors may prescribe erythromycin to speed digestion, metoclopramide to speed digestion and help relieve nausea, or other medications to help regulate digestion or reduce stomach acid secretion.\n                \nTo relieve diarrhea or other bowel problems, doctors may prescribe an antibiotic such as tetracycline, or other medications as appropriate.\n                \nDizziness and Weakness\n                \nSitting or standing slowly may help prevent the light-headedness, dizziness, or fainting associated with blood pressure and circulation problems. Raising the head of the bed or wearing elastic stockings may also help. Some people benefit from increased salt in the diet and treatment with salt-retaining hormones. Others benefit from high blood pressure medications. Physical therapy can help when muscle weakness or loss of coordination is a problem.\n                \nUrinary and Sexual Problems\n                \nTo clear up a urinary tract infection, the doctor will probably prescribe an antibiotic. Drinking plenty of fluids will help prevent another infection. People who have incontinence should try to urinate at regular intervalsevery 3 hours, for examplebecause they may not be able to tell when the bladder is full.\n                \nTo treat erectile dysfunction in men, the doctor will first do tests to rule out a hormonal cause. Several methods are available to treat erectile dysfunction caused by neuropathy. Medicines are available to help men have and maintain erections by increasing blood flow to the penis. Some are oral medications and others are injected into the penis or inserted into the urethra at the tip of the penis. Mechanical vacuum devices can also increase blood flow to the penis. Another option is to surgically implant an inflatable or semirigid device in the penis.\n                \nVaginal lubricants may be useful for women when neuropathy causes vaginal dryness. To treat problems with arousal and orgasm, the doctor may refer women to a gynecologist.\n                \nFoot Care\n                \nPeople with neuropathy need to take special care of their feet. The nerves to the feet are the longest in the body and are the ones most often affected by neuropathy. Loss of sensation in the feet means that sores or injuries may not be noticed and may become ulcerated or infected. Circulation problems also increase the risk of foot ulcers. Smoking increases the risk of foot problems and amputation. A health care provider may be able to provide help with quitting smoking.\n                \nMore than 60 percent of all nontraumatic lower-limb amputations in the United States occur in people with diabetes. Nontraumatic amputations are those not caused by trauma such as severe injuries from an accident. In 2004, about 71,000 nontraumatic amputations were performed in people with diabetes. Comprehensive foot care programs can reduce amputation rates by 45 to 85 percent.\n                \nCareful foot care involves\n                \n- cleaning the feet daily using warmnot hotwater and a mild soap. Soaking the feet should be avoided. A soft towel can be used to dry the feet and between the toes.  - inspecting the feet and toes every day for cuts, blisters, redness, swelling, calluses, or other problems. Using a mirrorhandheld or placed on the floormay be helpful in checking the bottoms of the feet, or another person can help check the feet. A health care provider should be notified of any problems.  - using lotion to moisturize the feet. Getting lotion between the toes should be avoided.  - filing corns and calluses gently with a pumice stone after a bath or shower.  - cutting toenails to the shape of the toes and filing the edges with an emery board each week or when needed.  - always wearing shoes or slippers to protect feet from injuries. Wearing thick, soft, seamless socks can prevent skin irritation.  - wearing shoes that fit well and allow the toes to move. New shoes can be broken in gradually by first wearing them for only an hour at a time.  - looking shoes over carefully before putting them on and feeling the insides to make sure the shoes are free of tears, sharp edges, or objects that might injure the feet.\n                \nPeople who need help taking care of their feet should consider making an appointment to see a foot doctor, also called a podiatrist.",

This leads to bile becoming trapped within the liver, causing inflammation, scarring, and eventually liver failure if left untreated.\n\nThere are two types of biliary atresia:\n\n1. Perinatal biliary atresia: This is the most common form, affecting around 80-90% of cases. It is present at birth or develops within the first few weeks of life.\n2. Embryonic biliary atresia: This is a rarer form, affecting around 10-20% of cases. It is caused by abnormal development of the bile ducts during fetal development.\n\nSymptoms of biliary atresia typically appear within the first two months of life and may include jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes), dark urine, light-colored stools, enlarged liver, and failure to gain weight. Treatment usually involves a surgical procedure called the Kasai procedure, which aims to restore bile flow. In some cases, a liver transplant may be necessary.",
        "original_answer": "Biliary atresia is a life-threatening condition in infants in which the bile ducts inside or outside the liver do not have normal openings.\n                \nBile ducts in the liver, also called hepatic ducts, are tubes that carry bile from the liver to the gallbladder for storage and to the small intestine for use in digestion. Bile is a fluid made by the liver that serves two main functions: carrying toxins and waste products out of the body and helping the body digest fats and absorb the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K.\n                \nWith biliary atresia, bile becomes trapped, builds up, and damages the liver. The damage leads to scarring, loss of liver tissue, and cirrhosis. Cirrhosis is a chronic, or long lasting, liver condition caused by scar tissue and cell damage that makes it hard for the liver to remove toxins from the blood. These toxins build up in the blood and the liver slowly deteriorates and malfunctions. Without treatment, the liver eventually fails and the infant needs a liver transplant to stay alive.\n                \nThe two types of biliary atresia are fetal and perinatal. Fetal biliary atresia appears while the baby is in the womb. Perinatal biliary atresia is much more common and does not become evident until 2 to 4 weeks after birth. Some infants, particularly those with the fetal form, also have birth defects in the heart, spleen, or intestines.",

        "original_answer": "The first symptom of biliary atresia is jaundicewhen the skin and whites of the eyes turn yellow. Jaundice occurs when the liver does not remove bilirubin, a reddish-yellow substance formed when hemoglobin breaks down. Hemoglobin is an iron-rich protein that gives blood its red color. Bilirubin is absorbed by the liver, processed, and released into bile. Blockage of the bile ducts forces bilirubin to build up in the blood.\n                \nOther common symptoms of biliary atresia include\n                \n- dark urine, from the high levels of bilirubin in the blood spilling over into the urine  - gray or white stools, from a lack of bilirubin reaching the intestines  - slow weight gain and growth",

The exact cause of biliary atresia is not known, but it is believed to be related to a combination of genetic, environmental, and immune system factors. Some theories suggest that it may be caused by a viral infection, genetic mutations, or abnormalities in the development of the bile ducts during fetal development. However, the exact cause remains unclear, and further research is needed to fully understand this complex condition.",
        "original_answer": "Biliary atresia likely has multiple causes, though none are yet proven. Biliary atresia is not an inherited disease, meaning it does not pass from parent to child. Therefore, survivors of biliary atresia are not at risk for passing the disorder to their children.\n                \nBiliary atresia is most likely caused by an event in the womb or around the time of birth. Possible triggers of the event may include one or more of the following:\n                \n- a viral or bacterial infection after birth, such as cytomegalovirus, reovirus, or rotavirus  - an immune system problem, such as when the immune system attacks the liver or bile ducts for unknown reasons  - a genetic mutation, which is a permanent change in a genes structure  - a problem during liver and bile duct development in the womb  - exposure to toxic substances",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Biliary atresia is typically diagnosed through a series of tests and procedures, including:\n\n1. Physical exam: A healthcare provider will perform a physical exam, which may include checking for a visible abdominal mass or jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes).\n2. Blood tests: Blood tests can be used to measure liver function and check for the presence of bilirubin, a yellow pigment that can indicate a problem with the liver or bile ducts.\n3. Ultrasound: An ultrasound can be used to create images of the liver and bile ducts, which can help identify any blockages or abnormalities.\n4. HIDA scan: A HIDA scan is a nuclear medicine test that involves injecting a small amount of radioactive material into the body. This can help track the flow of bile through the bile ducts and identify any blockages.\n5. Liver biopsy: A liver biopsy involves removing a small sample of liver tissue for examination under a microscope. This can help confirm the diagnosis of biliary atresia and determine the extent of liver damage.\n\nIf these tests suggest biliary atresia, surgery may be recommended to confirm the diagnosis and relieve any blockages in the bile ducts. This procedure is called a Kasai procedure and involves removing the damaged bile ducts and connecting the remaining bile ducts directly to the small intestine.",
        "original_answer": "No single test can definitively diagnose biliary atresia, so a series of tests is needed. All infants who still have jaundice 2 to 3 weeks after birth, or who have gray or white stools after 2 weeks of birth, should be checked for liver damage.2\n                \nInfants with suspected liver damage are usually referred to a\n                \n- pediatric gastroenterologist, a doctor who specializes in childrens digestive diseases  - pediatric hepatologist, a doctor who specializes in childrens liver diseases  - pediatric surgeon, a doctor who specializes in operating on childrens livers and bile ducts\n                \nThe health care provider may order some or all of the following tests to diagnose biliary atresia and rule out other causes of liver problems. If biliary atresia is still suspected after testing, the next step is diagnostic surgery for confirmation.\n                \nBlood test. A blood test involves drawing blood at a health care providers office or commercial facility and sending the sample to a lab for analysis. High levels of bilirubin in the blood can indicate blocked bile ducts.\n                \nAbdominal x rays. An x ray is a picture created by using radiation and recorded on film or on a computer. The amount of radiation used is small. An x ray is performed at a hospital or outpatient center by an x-ray technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologista doctor who specializes in medical imaging. Anesthesia is not needed, but sedation may be used to keep infants still. The infant will lie on a table during the x ray. The x-ray machine is positioned over the abdominal area. Abdominal x rays are used to check for an enlarged liver and spleen.\n                \nUltrasound. Ultrasound uses a device, called a transducer, that bounces safe, painless sound waves off organs to create an image of their structure. The procedure is performed in a health care providers office, outpatient center, or hospital by a specially trained technician, and the images are interpreted a radiologist. Anesthesia is not needed, but sedation may be used to keep the infant still. The images can show whether the liver or bile ducts are enlarged and whether tumors or cysts are blocking the flow of bile. An ultrasound cannot be used to diagnose biliary atresia, but it does help rule out other common causes of jaundice.\n                \nLiver scans. Liver scans are special x rays that use chemicals to create an image of the liver and bile ducts. Liver scans are performed at a hospital or outpatient facility, usually by a nuclear medicine technician. The infant will usually receive general anesthesia or be sedated before the procedure. Hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid scanning, a type of liver scan, uses injected radioactive dye to trace the path of bile in the body. The test can show if and where bile flow is blocked. Blockage is likely to be caused by biliary atresia.\n                \nLiver biopsy. A biopsy is a procedure that involves taking a piece of liver tissue for examination with a microscope. The biopsy is performed by a health care provider in a hospital with light sedation and local anesthetic. The health care provider uses imaging techniques such as ultrasound or a computerized tomography scan to guide the biopsy needle into the liver. The liver tissue is examined in a lab by a pathologista doctor who specializes in diagnosing diseases. A liver biopsy can show whether biliary atresia is likely. A biopsy can also help rule out other liver problems, such as hepatitisan irritation of the liver that sometimes causes permanent damage.\n                \nDiagnostic surgery. During diagnostic surgery, a pediatric surgeon makes an incision, or cut, in the abdomen to directly examine the liver and bile ducts. If the surgeon confirms that biliary atresia is the problem, a Kasai procedure will usually be performed immediately. Diagnostic surgery and the Kasai procedure are performed at a hospital or outpatient facility; the infant will be under general anesthesia during surgery.",

It's important to note that the outcome can vary greatly and early diagnosis and treatment can improve the prognosis.",
        "original_answer": "Biliary atresia is treated with surgery, called the Kasai procedure, or a liver transplant.\n                \nKasai Procedure\n                \nThe Kasai procedure, named after the surgeon who invented the operation, is usually the first treatment for biliary atresia. During a Kasai procedure, the pediatric surgeon removes the infants damaged bile ducts and brings up a loop of intestine to replace them. As a result, bile flows straight to the small intestine.\n                \nWhile this operation doesnt cure biliary atresia, it can restore bile flow and correct many problems caused by biliary atresia. Without surgery, infants with biliary atresia are unlikely to live past age 2. This procedure is most effective in infants younger than 3 months old, because they usually havent yet developed permanent liver damage. Some infants with biliary atresia who undergo a successful Kasai procedure regain good health and no longer have jaundice or major liver problems.\n                \nIf the Kasai procedure is not successful, infants usually need a liver transplant within 1 to 2 years. Even after a successful surgery, most infants with biliary atresia slowly develop cirrhosis over the years and require a liver transplant by adulthood.\n                \nLiver Transplant\n                \nLiver transplantation is the definitive treatment for biliary atresia, and the survival rate after surgery has increased dramatically in recent years. As a result, most infants with biliary atresia now survive. Progress in transplant surgery has also increased the availability and efficient use of livers for transplantation in children, so almost all infants requiring a transplant can receive one.\n                \nIn years past, the size of the transplanted liver had to match the size of the infants liver. Thus, only livers from recently deceased small children could be transplanted into infants with biliary atresia. New methods now make it possible to transplant a portion of a deceased adults liver into an infant. This type of surgery is called a reduced-size or split-liver transplant.\n                \nPart of a living adult donors liver can also be used for transplantation. Healthy liver tissue grows quickly; therefore, if an infant receives part of a liver from a living donor, both the donor and the infant can grow complete livers over time.\n                \nInfants with fetal biliary atresia are more likely to need a liver transplantand usually soonerthan infants with the more common perinatal form. The extent of damage can also influence how soon an infant will need a liver transplant.",

        "original_answer": "After the Kasai procedure, some infants continue to have liver problems and, even with the return of bile flow, some infants develop cirrhosis. Possible complications after the Kasai procedure include ascites, bacterial cholangitis, portal hypertension, and pruritus.\n                \nAscites. Problems with liver function can cause fluid to build up in the abdomen, called ascites. Ascites can lead to spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, a serious infection that requires immediate medical attention. Ascites usually only lasts a few weeks. If ascites lasts more than 6 weeks, cirrhosis is likely present and the infant will probably need a liver transplant.\n                \nBacterial cholangitis. Bacterial cholangitis is an infection of the bile ducts that is treated with bacteria-fighting medications called antibiotics.\n                \nPortal hypertension. The portal vein carries blood from the stomach, intestines, spleen, gallbladder, and pancreas to the liver. In cirrhosis, scar tissue partially blocks and slows the normal flow of blood, which increases the pressure in the portal vein. This condition is called portal hypertension. Portal hypertension can cause gastrointestinal bleeding that may require surgery and an eventual liver transplant.\n                \nPruritus. Pruritus is caused by bile buildup in the blood and irritation of nerve endings in the skin. Prescription medication may be recommended for pruritus, including resins that bind bile in the intestines and antihistamines that decrease the skins sensation of itching.",

Vitamin supplements may be recommended, along with adding medium-chain triglyceride oil to foods, liquids, and infant formula. The oil adds calories and is easier to digest without bile than other types of fats.

        "original_answer": "Proteinuriaalso called albuminuria or urine albuminis a condition in which urine contains an abnormal amount of protein. Albumin is the main protein in the blood. Proteins are the building blocks for all body parts, including muscles, bones, hair, and nails. Proteins in the blood also perform a number of important functions. They protect the body from infection, help blood clot, and keep the right amount of fluid circulating throughout the body.\n                \nAs blood passes through healthy kidneys, they filter out the waste products and leave in the things the body needs, like albumin and other proteins. Most proteins are too big to pass through the kidneys' filters into the urine. However, proteins from the blood can leak into the urine when the filters of the kidney, called glomeruli, are damaged.\n                \nProteinuria is a sign of chronic kidney disease (CKD), which can result from diabetes, high blood pressure, and diseases that cause inflammation in the kidneys. For this reason, testing for albumin in the urine is part of a routine medical assessment for everyone. Kidney disease is sometimes called renal disease. If CKD progresses, it can lead to end-stage renal disease (ESRD), when the kidneys fail completely.

However, many people with proteinuria do not experience any symptoms, and it is often discovered during routine tests. If you suspect you have proteinuria, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional for further evaluation and treatment.",
        "original_answer": "Proteinuria has no signs or symptoms in the early stages. Large amounts of protein in the urine may cause it to look foamy in the toilet. Also, because protein has left the body, the blood can no longer soak up enough fluid, so swelling in the hands, feet, abdomen, or face may occur. This swelling is called edema. These are signs of large protein loss and indicate that kidney disease has progressed. Laboratory testing is the only way to find out whether protein is in a persons urine before extensive kidney damage occurs.\n                \nSeveral health organizations recommend regular urine checks for people at risk for CKD. A 1996 study sponsored by the National Institutes of Health determined that proteinuria is the best predictor of progressive kidney failure in people with type 2 diabetes. The American Diabetes Association recommends regular urine testing for proteinuria for people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. The National Kidney Foundation recommends that routine checkups include testing for excess protein in the urine, especially for people in high-risk groups.",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Proteinuria is typically diagnosed through a urinalysis, which is a test that examines a sample of your urine for various substances, including protein. If the urinalysis shows a high level of protein, additional tests may be ordered, such as a 24-hour urine collection test or a kidney biopsy, to determine the underlying cause of the proteinuria. It is important to consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment.",
        "original_answer": "Until recently, an accurate protein measurement required a 24-hour urine collection. In a 24-hour collection, the patient urinates into a container, which is kept refrigerated between trips to the bathroom. The patient is instructed to begin collecting urine after the first trip to the bathroom in the morning. Every drop of urine for the rest of the day is to be collected in the container. The next morning, the patient adds the first urination after waking and the collection is complete.\n                \nIn recent years, researchers have found that a single urine sample can provide the needed information. In the newer technique, the amount of albumin in the urine sample is compared with the amount of creatinine, a waste product of normal muscle breakdown. The measurement is called a urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR). A urine sample containing more than 30 milligrams of albumin for each gram of creatinine (30 mg/g) is a warning that there may be a problem. If the laboratory test exceeds 30 mg/g, another UACR test should be done 1 to 2 weeks later. If the second test also shows high levels of protein, the person has persistent proteinuria, a sign of declining kidney function, and should have additional tests to evaluate kidney function.",

        "original_answer": "Kidney dysplasia is a condition in which the internal structures of one or both of a fetus kidneys do not develop normally while in the womb. During normal development, two thin tubes of muscle called ureters grow into the kidneys and branch out to form a network of tiny structures called tubules. The tubules collect urine as the fetus grows in the womb. In kidney dysplasia, the tubules fail to branch out completely. Urine that would normally flow through the tubules has nowhere to go. Urine collects inside the affected kidney and forms fluid-filled sacs called cysts. The cysts replace normal kidney tissue and prevent the kidney from functioning.\n                \nKidney dysplasia can affect one kidney or both kidneys. Babies with severe kidney dysplasia affecting both kidneys generally do not survive birth. Those who do survive may need the following early in life:\n                \n- blood-filtering treatments called dialysis  - a kidney transplant\n                \nChildren with dysplasia in only one kidney have normal kidney function if the other kidney is unaffected.

        "original_answer": "The kidneys are two bean-shaped organs, each about the size of a fist. They are located just below the rib cage, one on each side of the spine. Every day, the two kidneys filter about 120 to 150 quarts of blood to produce about 1 to 2 quarts of urine, which is composed of wastes and extra fluid. Children produce less urine than adultsthe amount they produce depends on their age. The urine flows from the kidneys to the bladder through the two ureters, one on each side of the bladder. The bladder stores urine. The muscles of the bladder wall remain relaxed while the bladder fills with urine. As the bladder fills to capacity, signals sent to the brain tell a person to find a toilet soon. When the bladder empties, urine flows out of the body through a tube called the urethra, located at the bottom of the bladder.\n                \nThe kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra are parts of the urinary tract.

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Mineral and Bone Disorder in Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD-MBD) is a condition that occurs when the kidneys can no longer regulate the levels of minerals and hormones that are important for bone health. This can lead to weak bones, bone pain, and increased risk of fractures. It can also cause calcification (hardening) of blood vessels and soft tissues, which can increase the risk of heart disease and other complications.\n\nCKD-MBD is caused by the accumulation of waste products and toxins in the body due to decreased kidney function. This can disrupt the balance of minerals such as calcium, phosphorus, and vitamin D, as well as hormones such as parathyroid hormone (PTH) and fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23). These imbalances can lead to changes in bone structure and function, as well as other complications.\n\nTreatment for CKD-MBD typically involves managing the levels of minerals and hormones in the body through diet, medication, and dialysis.

Impaired ability to regulate phosphorus and calcium levels in the body.\n2. Decreased production of active vitamin D, which is essential for bone health.\n3. Accumulation of FGF-23 (fibroblast growth factor 23), a hormone that regulates phosphate levels, leading to further disruption of mineral balance.\n4. Changes in the parathyroid gland function, leading to an imbalance in parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels.\n5. Chronic acidosis, a condition where the body has too much acid, which can lead to bone dissolution.\n\nThese factors can lead to abnormalities in bone structure, mineralization, and strength, as well as an increased risk of fractures and other complications.",
        "original_answer": "Chronic kidney disease causes mineral and bone disorder because the kidneys do not properly balance the mineral levels in the body. The kidneys\n                \n- stop activating calcitriol. The low levels of calcitriol in the body create an imbalance of calcium in the blood.  - do not remove the phosphorus in the blood properly, so phosphorus levels rise in the blood. The extra phosphorus pulls calcium out of the bones, causing them to weaken.\n                \nAnother factor contributes to the cause of mineral and bone disorder. When the kidneys are damaged, the parathyroid gland releases parathyroid hormone into the blood to pull calcium from the bones and raise blood calcium levels. This response restores the balance of phosphorus and calcium; however, it also starves the bones of much-needed calcium.",

Medical history and physical exam: The doctor will take a detailed medical history and perform a physical exam to assess for symptoms of MBD, such as bone pain, muscle cramps, and weakness.\n2. Laboratory tests: The following lab tests are used to diagnose MBD:\n* Serum calcium, phosphorus, and intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) levels.\n* Alkaline phosphatase, a bone-specific isoenzyme, to assess bone turnover.\n* Vitamin D levels, as vitamin D deficiency can contribute to MBD.\n* Electrolytes, such as sodium, potassium, and bicarbonate, to assess for electrolyte imbalances.\n3. Imaging studies: Bone X-rays, bone scans, and bone biopsy can provide information about bone density, bone turnover, and mineralization.\n4. Other tests: Other tests, such as dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and quantitative computed tomography (QCT), can provide information about bone density and strength.\n\nThe diagnosis of MBD in CKD is often complex and requires the expertise of a nephrologist or endocrinologist.

He or she will ask the patient or caretaker questions about when the patient was first diagnosed with CKD and whether any family members have also had mineral and bone disorder with or without CKD.\n                \nPhysical Exam\n                \nA physical exam may help diagnose mineral and bone disorder in CKD. During a physical exam, a health care provider usually examines a patients body for changes in bone structure.\n                \nBlood Test\n                \nA blood test involves drawing blood at a health care providers office or a commercial facility and sending the sample to a lab for analysis. The blood test shows levels of calcium, phosphorus, parathyroid hormone, and sometimes vitamin D.\n                \nBone Biopsy\n                \nA bone biopsy is a procedure that removes a piece of bone tissue for examination with a microscope. A health care provider performs the biopsy in a hospital with light sedation and local anesthetic. The health care provider uses imaging techniques such as ultrasound or a computerized tomography scan to guide the biopsy needle into the hip bone. A pathologista doctor who specializes in diagnosing diseasesexamines the bone tissue in a lab. The test can show whether a persons bone cells are building normal bone.\n                \nX-ray\n                \nAn x-ray is a picture created by using radiation and recorded on film or on a computer.

Patients do not need anesthesia. The patient will lie on a table or stand during the x-ray. The technician will position the x-ray machine over the bone area. The patient will hold his or her breath as the x-ray machine takes the picture so that the picture will not be blurry. The radiographer may ask the patient to change position for additional pictures. An x-ray can show extra calcium in blood vessels.\n                \nEach of these tests can help the health care provider determine whether CKD or some other condition is causing the mineral and bone disorder and decide on a course of treatment.",

        "original_answer": "Treating mineral and bone disorder in CKD includes preventing damage to bones by controlling parathyroid hormone levels through changes in eating, diet, and nutrition; medications and supplements; and dialysis. If these treatments do not bring parathyroid hormone levels under control, a health care provider may remove a persons parathyroid glands surgically, a procedure called a parathyroidectomy.\n                \nEating, Diet, and Nutrition\n                \nChanges in diet can treat mineral and bone disorder in CKD. Reducing dietary intake of phosphorus is one of the most important steps in preventing bone disease. Most foods contain phosphorus; however, processed and packaged foods contain especially high levels of phosphorus. Food producers use phosphorus as an additive to preserve the food on the shelf. People who have CKD or are on dialysis should avoid packaged foods containing ingredients that include the letters PHOS. A renal dietitian can help develop a dietary plan to control phosphorus levels in the blood. Some drinks and natural foods also contain high amounts of phosphorus, including\n                \n- beer  - cheese  - cocoa  - dark sodas  - dried beans  - milk  - nuts  - peanut butter  - peas\n                \nMore information is provided in the NIDDK health topics, How To Read a Food Label: Tips for People with Chronic Kidney Disease and Phosphorus: Tips for People with Chronic Kidney Disease.\n                \nMedications and Supplements\n                \nMedications protect the bones by restoring the proper balance of minerals and hormones. If the kidneys do not make adequate amounts of calcitriol, a health care provider may prescribe synthetic calcitriol as a pill (Rocaltrol) or, for dialysis patients, in an injectable form (Calcijex). Calcitriol helps reduce parathyroid hormone levels. Medications called doxercalciferol (Hectorol) and paricalcitol (Zemplar) act like calcitriol because they are also activated forms of vitamin D. A health care provider may prescribe a calcium supplement in addition to calcitriol or another activated form of vitamin D.\n                \nCertain forms of vitamin Davailable by prescription or as over-the-counter vitamin supplementsrequire activation by a persons kidneys before they can act as calcitriol does. However, the benefits of some of these not-yet-activated forms of vitamin Dfor example, ergocalciferol (Calciferol, Drisdol) or cholecalciferol (Delta D3)are unclear. To help ensure coordinated and safe care, people should discuss their use of alternative medications, including use of vitamin and mineral supplements, with their health care provider.\n                \nCinacalcet hydrochloride (Sensipar) belongs to another class of prescription medications called calcimimetics. Cinacalcet lowers parathyroid hormone levels by imitating calciums effects on the parathyroid gland. Generally, this medication is used only in people on dialysis.\n                \nOften, health care providers will prescribe medications called phosphate binderssuch as calcium carbonate (Tums), calcium acetate (PhosLo), sevelamer carbonate (Renvela), or lanthanum carbonate (Fosrenol)to take with meals and snacks to bind phosphorus in the bowel. These medications decrease the absorption of phosphorus into the blood.\n                \nDialysis\n                \nDialysis is the process of filtering wastes and extra fluid from the body by means other than the kidneys. The two forms of dialysis are hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis:\n                \n- Hemodialysis uses a machine to circulate a persons blood through a filter outside the body. The blood passes from a patients body through a needle, at nearly 1 pint per minute. The blood then travels through a tube that takes it to the filter, called a dialyzer. Inside the dialyzer, the blood flows through thin fibers that filter out wastes and extra fluid. After the machine filters the blood, it passes back to the body through another tube. More information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Treatment Methods for Kidney Failure: Hemodialysis.  - Peritoneal dialysis uses the lining of the abdomen to filter a persons blood inside the body. A soft tube called a catheter is placed in the patients abdomen a few weeks before peritoneal dialysis begins. A person uses the catheter to fill the empty space inside the abdomen with dialysis solutiona kind of salty waterfrom a plastic bag. While inside the body, the dialysis solution absorbs wastes and extra fluid. After a few hours, the person drains the used dialysis solution into another bag for disposal. The person then restarts the process with a fresh bag of dialysis solution. More information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Treatment Methods for Kidney Failure: Peritoneal Dialysis.\n                \nIncreasing a persons dialysis dose can help control the blood phosphorus level. In hemodialysis, the health care provider can adjust the dose by increasing how quickly the blood flows to and from the dialyzer. Another way to adjust the dose involves increasing the time of a persons dialysis session or the number of sessions. In peritoneal dialysis, using more dialysis solution in each fill or increasing the number of fills each day increases the dose. More information is provided in the NIDDK health topics:\n                \n- Hemodialysis Dose and Adequacy  - Peritoneal Dialysis Dose and Adequacy\n                \nParathyroidectomy\n                \nIf diet, medications, and dialysis cant control parathyroid hormone levels, a surgeon can remove one or more of the parathyroid glands. He or she performs the procedure using general anesthesia.\n                \nA good treatment program, including a low-phosphorus diet, appropriate medications, adequate dialysis, and, if necessary, surgery, can improve the bodys ability to repair bones damaged by mineral and bone disorder in CKD. Overall, people can improve their bone health by exercising and not smoking. People should consult a health care provider before beginning any exercise program.",

Take prescribed medications: If your doctor prescribes medications to manage your MBD, such as phosphate binders, active vitamin D, or calcimimetics, be sure to take them as directed.\n3. Follow a special diet: Your doctor may recommend a special diet to help manage your MBD. This may include limiting your intake of high-phosphorus foods, such as dairy products, nuts, and beans.\n4. Get enough vitamin D: Vitamin D is important for bone health. Your doctor may recommend supplements or recommend foods that are fortified with vitamin D.\n5. Exercise regularly: Regular exercise can help keep your bones strong. Talk to your doctor about what types of exercise are safe for you.\n6. Monitor your symptoms: Let your doctor know if you experience any symptoms of MBD, such as bone pain, muscle cramps, or itching.\n\nRemember, it's important to work closely with your healthcare team to manage MBD in CKD. Don't make any changes to your treatment plan without first consulting your doctor.",
        "original_answer": "- Mineral and bone disorder in chronic kidney disease (CKD) occurs when damaged kidneys and abnormal hormone levels cause calcium and phosphorus levels in a persons blood to be out of balance. Mineral and bone disorder commonly occurs in people with CKD and affects most people with kidney failure receiving dialysis.  - Chronic kidney disease is kidney damage that occurs slowly over many years, often due to diabetes or high blood pressure. Once damaged, the kidneys cant filter blood as they should.  - Hormones and minerals are important because they help bones stay strong. If a persons hormones and minerals are out of balance, his or her bones can become weak and malformed.   - Parathyroid hormone plays an important role in controlling calcium levels in the blood. When kidneys do not function properly, extra parathyroid hormone is released in the blood to move calcium from inside the bones into the blood.  - Chronic kidney disease causes mineral and bone disorder because the kidneys do not properly balance the mineral levels in the body. The kidneys stop activating calcitriol and do not remove the phosphorus in the blood properly.  - The complications of mineral and bone disorder in CKD include slowed bone growth and deformities, and heart and blood vessel problems.   - Treating mineral and bone disorder in CKD includes preventing damage to bones by controlling parathyroid hormone levels through changes in eating, diet, and nutrition; medications and supplements; and dialysis.   - Reducing dietary intake of phosphorus is one of the most important steps in preventing bone disease.  - If diet, medications, and dialysis cant control parathyroid hormone levels, a surgeon can remove one or more of the parathyroid glands.",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "An ectopic kidney is a result of a developmental abnormality that occurs during fetal growth, typically before the 8th week of pregnancy. The exact cause is not fully understood, but it is believed to be related to genetic factors and/or environmental influences that affect the development of the urinary system. In an ectopic kidney, the kidney does not migrate to its normal position in the abdomen during fetal development. Instead, it may be located in the pelvis, abdomen, or even in the thigh region. This condition is relatively rare and is usually not a cause for concern unless it is associated with other complications, such as urinary tract infections or kidney stones.",
        "original_answer": "During fetal development, a babys kidneys first appear as buds inside the pelvisthe bowl-shaped bone that supports the spine and holds up the digestive, urinary, and reproductive organsnear the bladder. As the kidneys develop, they move gradually toward their usual position in the back near the rib cage. Sometimes, one of the kidneys remains in the pelvis or stops moving before it reaches its usual position. In other cases, the kidney moves higher than the usual position. Rarely does a child have two ectopic kidneys.\n                \nMost kidneys move toward the rib cage, but one may cross over so that both kidneys are on the same side of the body. When a crossover occurs, the two kidneys often grow together and become fused.\n                \nFactors that may lead to an ectopic kidney include\n                \n- poor development of a kidney bud  - a defect in the kidney tissue responsible for prompting the kidney to move to its usual position  - genetic abnormalities  - the mother being sick or being exposed to an agent, such as a drug or chemical, that causes birth defects",

While many people with an ectopic kidney do not experience any symptoms or complications, there are some potential risks to be aware of. These can include:\n\n1. Urinary tract infections: The abnormal position of the ectopic kidney can make it more difficult to completely empty the bladder, which can increase the risk of urinary tract infections.\n2. Kidney stones: People with an ectopic kidney may be more prone to developing kidney stones due to the abnormal shape or position of the kidney.\n3. Hydronephrosis: If the ectopic kidney is obstructed or has abnormal urinary flow, it can lead to a condition called hydronephrosis, where the kidney becomes swollen due to a buildup of urine.\n4. Renal failure: In rare cases, an ectopic kidney may not function properly, leading to renal failure.\n5. High blood pressure: There is some evidence to suggest that people with an ectopic kidney may be at increased risk for high blood pressure, although the exact relationship is not well understood.\n\nIt is important to note that not all cases of ectopic kidney will lead to complications, and many people with the condition may never experience any symptoms. However, if you have been diagnosed with an ectopic kidney, it is important to work closely with your healthcare provider to monitor your kidney function and address any potential complications as they arise.",
        "original_answer": "Possible complications of an ectopic kidney include problems with urine drainage from that kidney. Sometimes, urine can even flow backwards from the bladder to the kidney, a problem called vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). More information about VUR is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Vesicoureteral Reflux.\n                \nAbnormal urine flow and the placement of the ectopic kidney can lead to various problems:\n                \n- Infection. Normally, urine flow washes out bacteria and keeps them from growing in the kidneys and urinary tract. When a kidney is out of the usual position, urine may get trapped in the ureter or in the kidney itself. Urine that remains in the urinary tract gives bacteria the chance to grow and spread. Symptoms of a urinary tract infection include frequent or painful urination, back or abdominal pain, fever, chills, and cloudy or foul-smelling urine.  - Stones. Urinary stones form from substances found in the urine, such as calcium and oxalate. When urine remains in the urinary tract for too long, the risk that these substances will have time to form stones is increased. Symptoms of urinary stones include extreme pain in the back, side, or pelvis; blood in the urine; fever or chills; vomiting; and a burning feeling during urination.  - Kidney damage. If urine backs up all the way to the kidney, damage to the kidney can occur. As a result, the kidney cant filter wastes and extra water from the blood. One ectopic kidney, even when it has no function, will not cause kidney failure. The other kidney can usually perform the functions of two healthy kidneys. Total kidney failure happens only in rare cases when both kidneys are damaged.  - Trauma. If the ectopic kidney is in the lower abdomen or pelvis, it may be susceptible to injury from blunt trauma. People with an ectopic kidney who want to participate in body contact sports may want to wear protective gear.",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "An ectopic kidney is a kidney that is located in an abnormal position, usually in the pelvis or lower abdomen. To diagnose an ectopic kidney, a healthcare provider will typically use imaging tests such as an ultrasound, CT scan, or MRI. These tests can help to visualize the location of the kidney and determine if it is functioning properly. In some cases, a healthcare provider may also use a nuclear medicine scan, which involves injecting a small amount of radioactive material into the body and taking images to see how the kidneys are functioning. If an ectopic kidney is causing symptoms, such as urinary tract infections or kidney stones, additional tests may be needed to determine the cause of these symptoms. It is important to note that some people with an ectopic kidney may not experience any symptoms and may not require treatment.",
        "original_answer": "A health care provider may use one or more of the following imaging tests to diagnose an ectopic kidney:\n                \n- Ultrasound. An ultrasound uses a device, called a transducer, that bounces safe, painless sound waves off organs to create an image of their structure. The procedure is performed in a health care providers office, outpatient center, or hospital by a specially trained technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologista doctor who specializes in medical imaging; anesthesia is not needed. The images can show the location of the kidneys.  - Intravenous pyelogram (IVP). An IVP is an x ray of the urinary tract. A special dye, called contrast medium, is injected into a vein in the persons arm, travels through the body to the kidneys, and makes urine visible on the x ray. The procedure is performed in a health care providers office, outpatient center, or hospital by an x-ray technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologist; anesthesia is not needed. An IVP can show a blockage in the urinary tract. In children, ultrasounds are usually done instead of IVPs.  - Voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG). A VCUG is an x-ray image of the bladder and urethra taken while the bladder is full and during urination, also called voiding. The bladder and urethra are filled with contrast medium to make the structures clearly visible on the x-ray images. The x-ray machine captures images of the contrast medium while the bladder is full and when the person urinates. The procedure is performed in a health care providers office, outpatient center, or hospital by an x-ray technician supervised by a radiologist, who then interprets the images. Anesthesia is not needed, but sedation may be used for some people. The test can show abnormalities of the inside of the urethra and bladder and whether urine is backing up toward the kidneys during urination.  - Radionuclide scan. A radionuclide scan is an imaging technique that relies on the detection of small amounts of radiation after injection of radioactive chemicals. Because the dose of the radioactive chemicals is small, the risk of causing damage to cells is low. Special cameras and computers are used to create images of the radioactive chemicals as they pass through the kidneys. The procedure is performed in a health care providers office, outpatient center, or hospital by a specially trained technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologist; anesthesia is not needed. This test can show the location of an ectopic kidney and whether the ureters are blocked.  - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI machines use radio waves and magnets to produce detailed pictures of the bodys internal organs and soft tissues without using x rays. An MRI may include the injection of contrast medium. With most MRI machines, the person lies on a table that slides into a tunnel-shaped device that may be open ended or closed at one end; some newer machines are designed to allow the person to lie in a more open space. The procedure is performed in an outpatient center or hospital by a specially trained technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologist; anesthesia is not needed though light sedation may be used for people with a fear of confined spaces. MRIs can show the location of the kidneys.\n                \nIn addition to imaging tests, blood tests may be done to determine how well the kidneys are working. These tests are almost always normal in people with an ectopic kidney, even if it is badly damaged, because the other kidney usually has completely normal function.",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Kidney failure, also known as end-stage renal disease (ESRD), is a serious condition that requires proper treatment. There are two main treatment options for kidney failure: dialysis and transplantation.\n\n1. Dialysis: This is a process that uses a machine to filter waste and excess fluids from your blood. There are two main types of dialysis: hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. Hemodialysis involves using a machine outside your body to filter your blood, while peritoneal dialysis involves using a solution that is introduced into your abdomen to filter your blood internally.\n2. Transplantation: This involves receiving a new kidney from a donor. A successful kidney transplant can restore normal kidney function and improve your quality of life. However, it is important to note that transplantation is not a cure for kidney failure, and you will need to take immunosuppressive medications for the rest of your life to prevent your body from rejecting the new kidney.\n\nWhen choosing a treatment option, it is important to consider several factors, including your overall health, lifestyle, personal preferences, and access to healthcare resources. It is also important to discuss your options with your healthcare provider and loved ones to make an informed decision.",
        "original_answer": "Chronic kidney disease means you have damaged kidneys that cannot filter blood normally. Wastes then build up in your blood, harming your body. Kidney disease usually does not get better and may lead to kidney failure. If your kidneys fail, current treatment options can help you live a longer, healthier life. Some people live with kidney disease for years without needing treatment. Others progress quickly to kidney failure.",

        "original_answer": "Purpose of Hemodialysis\n                \nThe purpose of hemodialysis is to filter your blood. This type of dialysis uses a machine to remove harmful wastes and extra fluid, as your kidneys did when they were healthy. Hemodialysis helps control blood pressure and balance important minerals, such as potassium, sodium, calcium, and bicarbonate, in your blood. Hemodialysis is not a cure for kidney failure; however, it can help you feel better and live longer.\n                \nHow Hemodialysis Works\n                \nBefore you can begin dialysis, a surgeon will create a vascular access, usually in your arm. A vascular access lets high volumes of blood flow continuously during hemodialysis treatments to filter the largest possible amounts of blood per treatment.\n                \nHemodialysis uses a machine to move your blood through a filter, called a dialyzer, outside your body. A pump on the hemodialysis machine draws your blood through a needle into a tube, a few ounces at a time. Your blood then travels through the tube, which takes it to the dialyzer. Inside the dialyzer, your blood flows through thin fibers that filter out wastes and extra fluid. After the dialyzer filters your blood, another tube carries your blood back to your body. You can do hemodialysis at a dialysis center or in your home.\n                \nHemodialysis can replace part of your kidney function. You will also need dietary changes, medicines, and limits on water and other liquids you drink and get from food. Your dietary changes, the number of medicines you need, and limits on liquid will depend on where you receive your treatmentsat a dialysis center or at homeand how often you receive treatmentsthree or more times a week.\n                \nPros and Cons of Hemodialysis\n                \nThe pros and cons of hemodialysis differ for each person. What may be bad for one person may be good for another. Following is a list of the general pros and cons of dialysis center and home hemodialysis.\n                \nDialysis Center Hemodialysis\n                \nPros\n                \n- Dialysis centers are widely available.  - Trained health care providers are with you at all times and help administer the treatment.  - You can get to know other people with kidney failure who also need hemodialysis.  - You dont have to have a trained partner or keep equipment in your home.\n                \nCons\n                \n- The center arranges everyones treatments and allows few exceptions to the schedule.  - You need to travel to the center for treatment.  - This treatment has the strictest diet and limits on liquids because the longer time between treatments means wastes and extra fluid can build up in your body.  - You may have more frequent ups and downs in how you feel from day to day because of the longer time between sessions.  - Feeling better after a treatment may take a few hours.\n                \nHome Hemodialysis\n                \nPros\n                \n- You can do the treatment at the times you choose; however, you should follow your doctors orders about how many times a week you need treatment.  - You dont have to travel to a dialysis center.  - You gain a sense of control over your treatment.  - You will have fewer ups and downs in how you feel from day to day because of more frequent sessions.  - You can do your treatments at times that will let you work outside the home.  - You will have a more manageable diet and fewer limits on liquids because the shorter time between sessions prevents the buildup of wastes and extra fluid.  - You can take along a hemodialysis machine when traveling.  - You can spend more time with your loved ones because you dont have to go to the dialysis center three times a week.\n                \nCons\n                \n- Not all dialysis centers offer home hemodialysis training and support.  - You and a family member or friend will have to set aside a week or more at the beginning for training.  - Helping with treatments may be stressful for your family or friend.  - You need space for storing the hemodialysis machine and supplies at home.  - You will need to learn to put dialysis needles into your vascular access.  - Medicare and private insurance companies may limit the number of treatments they will pay for when you use home hemodialysis. Few people can afford the costs for additional treatments.\n                \nQuestions to Ask My Doctor\n                \nYou may want to ask your doctor these questions:\n                \n- Is hemodialysis the best treatment choice for me? Why?   - If Im treated at a dialysis center, can I go to the center of my choice?  - What should I look for in a dialysis center?  - Will my kidney doctor see me at the dialysis center?  - What does hemodialysis feel like?  - How will hemodialysis affect my ____ [blood pressure, diabetes, other conditions]?  - Is home hemodialysis available in my area? What type of training will I need? Who will train my partner and me?  - Will I be able to keep working? Can I have treatments at night? Will I be able to care for my children?  - How much should I exercise?   - Whom do I contact if I have problems?  - Who will be on my health care team? How can the members of my health care team help me?  - If I do home hemodialysis, will my insurance pay for more than three sessions a week?  - With whom can I talk about finances, sex, or family concerns?   - How/where can I talk with other people who have faced this decision?\n                \nMore information about Hemodialysis and Home Hemodialysis is provided in the NIDDK health topics, Treatment Methods for Kidney Failure: Hemodialysis and Home Hemodialysis.

        "original_answer": "Purpose of Peritoneal Dialysis\n                \nThe purpose of peritoneal dialysis is to filter wastes and extra fluid from your body. This type of dialysis uses the lining of your bellythe space in your body that holds your stomach, bowels, and liverto filter your blood. This lining, called the peritoneum, acts to do the work of your kidneys.\n                \nHow Peritoneal Dialysis Works\n                \nA doctor will place a soft tube, called a catheter, in your belly a few weeks before you start treatment. The catheter stays in your belly permanently. When you start peritoneal dialysis, you will empty a kind of salty water, called dialysis solution, from a plastic bag through the catheter into your belly. When the bag is empty, you can disconnect your catheter from the bag so you can move around and do your normal activities. While the dialysis solution is inside your belly, it soaks up wastes and extra fluid from your body. After a few hours, you drain the used dialysis solution through another tube into a drain bag. You can throw away the used dialysis solution, now filled with wastes and extra fluid, in a toilet or tub. Then you start over with a fresh bag of dialysis solution. The process of emptying the used dialysis solution and refilling your belly with fresh solution is called an exchange. The process goes on continuously, so you always have dialysis solution in your belly soaking up wastes and extra fluid from your body.\n                \nTypes of Peritoneal Dialysis\n                \nTwo types of peritoneal dialysis are available. After you have learned about the types of peritoneal dialysis, you can choose the type that best fits your life. If one schedule or type of peritoneal dialysis does not suit you, talk with your doctor about trying the other type.\n                \n- Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis does not require a machine and you can do it in any clean, well-lit place. The time period that the dialysis solution is in your belly is the dwell time. With continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis, the dialysis solution stays in your belly for a dwell time of 4 to 6 hours, or more. The process of draining the used dialysis solution and replacing it with fresh solution takes about 30 to 40 minutes. Most people change the dialysis solution at least four times a day and sleep with solution in their belly at night. With continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis, you do not have to wake up and perform dialysis tasks during the night.  - Continuous cycler-assisted peritoneal dialysis uses a machine called a cycler to fill and empty your belly three to five times during the night while you sleep. In the morning, you begin one exchange with a dwell time that lasts the entire day. You may do an additional exchange in the middle of the afternoon without the cycler to increase the amount of waste removed and to reduce the amount of fluid left behind in your body.\n                \nYou may need a combination of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis and continuous cycler-assisted peritoneal dialysis if you weigh more than 175 pounds or if your peritoneum filters wastes slowly. For example, some people use a cycler at night and perform one exchange during the day. Others do four exchanges during the day and use a minicycler to perform one or more exchanges during the night. Youll work with your health care team to find the best schedule for you.\n                \nPros and Cons of Peritoneal Dialysis\n                \nEach type of peritoneal dialysis has pros and cons.\n                \nContinuous Ambulatory Peritoneal Dialysis\n                \nPros\n                \n- You can do continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis alone.  - You can do continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis at the times you choose, as long as you perform the required number of exchanges each day.  - You can do continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis in many locations.  - You can travel as long as you bring dialysis bags with you or have them delivered to your destination.  - You dont need a machine for continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis.  - You gain a sense of control over your treatment.\n                \nCons\n                \n- Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis can disrupt your daily schedule.  - Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis is a continuous treatment, and you should do all exchanges 7 days a week.  - Boxes of dialysis solution will take up space in your home.\n                \nContinuous Cycler-assisted Peritoneal Dialysis\n                \nPros\n                \n- You can do exchanges at night, while you sleep.  - You may not have to perform exchanges during the day.\n                \nCons\n                \n- You need a machine.  - Your connection to the cycler limits your movement at night.\n                \nQuestions to Ask My Doctor\n                \n- Is peritoneal dialysis the best treatment choice for me? Why? If yes, which type is best?   - What type of training do I need, and how long will it take?  - What does peritoneal dialysis feel like?   - How will peritoneal dialysis affect my ____ [blood pressure, diabetes, other conditions]?   - Will I be able to keep working?

        "original_answer": "What should I know about kidney transplantation?\n                \nThe purpose of kidney transplantation is to surgically place a healthy kidney from a donora person who has just died or a living person, most often a family memberinto your body. A kidney from someone who has just died is a deceased donor kidney. A kidney from a living person is a living donor kidney. A functioning kidney transplant does a better job of filtering wastes and keeping you healthy than dialysis.\n                \nHow Kidney Transplantation Works\n                \nSurgeonsdoctors who specialize in surgeryplace most transplanted kidneys in the lower front part of your abdomen. The kidney is connected to an artery, which brings unfiltered blood into the kidney, and a vein, which takes filtered blood out of the kidney. The surgeon also transplants the ureter from the donor to let urine from the new kidney flow to your bladder. Unless your damaged kidneys cause problems such as infection, they can remain in their normal position. The transplanted kidney takes over the job of filtering your blood. Your body normally attacks anything it sees as foreign, so to keep your body from attacking the kidney you need to take medicines called immunosuppressants for as long as the transplanted kidney functions.\n                \nPros and Cons of Kidney Transplantation\n                \nFollowing is a list of the pros and cons of kidney transplantation.\n                \nKidney Transplantation\n                \nPros\n                \n- A transplanted kidney works like a healthy kidney.  - If you have a living donor, you can choose the time of your operation.  - You may feel healthier and have an improved quality of life.  - You have fewer dietary restrictions.  - You wont need dialysis.  - People who receive a donated kidney have a greater chance of living a longer life than those who stay on dialysis.\n                \nCons\n                \n- Transplantation requires surgery.  - You will go through extensive medical testing at the transplant clinic.  - You may need to wait years for a deceased donor kidney.  - Your body may reject the new kidney, so one transplant may not last a lifetime.  - Youll need to take immunosuppressants, which may cause other health problems, for as long as the transplanted kidney functions.\n                \nQuestions to Ask My Doctor\n                \nYou may want to ask your doctor these questions:\n                \n- Is transplantation the best treatment choice for me? Why?  - What are my chances of having a successful transplant?  - How do I find out whether a family member or friend can donate?  - What are the risks to a family member or friend who donates?  - If a family member or friend does not donate, who will place me on a waiting list for a kidney? How long will I have to wait?  - How will I know if my donor kidney is working?  - How long does a transplanted kidney function?  - What side effects do immunosuppressants cause?  - Who will be on my transplant team?

        "original_answer": "Conservative management for kidney failure is the choice to say no to or stop dialysis treatments. For many people, dialysis not only extends life, it also improves the quality of life. For others who have serious conditions in addition to kidney failure, dialysis may seem like a burden that only prolongs suffering. If you have serious conditions in addition to kidney failure, dialysis may not prolong your life or improve the quality of your life.\n                \nYou have the right to say no to or stop dialysis. You may want to speak with your doctor, spouse, family, counselor, or renal social worker, who helps people with kidney disease, to help you make this decision.\n                \nIf you stop dialysis treatments or say you do not want to begin them, you may live for a few weeks or for several months, depending on your health and your remaining kidney function. You may choose to receive care from a hospicea facility or home program designed to meet the physical and emotional needs of the terminally illduring this time. Hospice care focuses on relief of pain and other symptoms. Whether or not you choose to use a hospice, your doctor can give you medicines to make you more comfortable. Your doctor can also give you medicines to treat the problems of kidney failure, such as anemia or weak bones. You may restart dialysis treatment if you change your mind.\n                \nAdvance Directives\n                \nAn advance directive is a statement or document in which you give instructions either to withhold certain treatments, such as dialysis, or to provide them, depending on your wishes and the specific circumstances. Even if you are happy with your quality of life on dialysis, you should think about circumstances that might make you want to stop dialysis treatments. At some point in a medical crisis, you might lose the ability to tell your health care team and loved ones what you want. Advance directives may include\n                \n- a living will  - a durable power of attorney for health care decisions  - a do not resuscitate (DNR) ordera legal form that tells your health care team you do not want cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) or other life-sustaining treatment if your heart were to stop or if you were to stop breathing.\n                \nA living will is a document that details the conditions under which you would want to refuse treatment. You may state that you want your health care team to use all available means to sustain your life, or you may direct that you be withdrawn from dialysis if you fall into a coma from which you most likely wont wake up. In addition to dialysis, you may choose or refuse the following life-sustaining treatments:\n                \n- CPR  - feedings through a tube in your stomach  - mechanical or artificial means to help you breathe  - medicines to treat infections  - surgery  - receiving blood\n                \nRefusing to have CPR is the same as a DNR order. If you choose to have a DNR order, your doctor will place the order in your medical chart.\n                \nA durable power of attorney for health care decisions or a health care proxy is a document you use to assign a person to make health care decisions for you in the event you cannot make them for yourself. Make sure the person you name understands your values and will follow your instructions.\n                \nEach state has its own laws on advance directives. You can obtain a form for an advance medical directive thats valid in your state from the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organizationsee For More Information.",

Dialysis: If your kidneys can no longer remove waste and excess fluid from your body, you may need dialysis. There are two main types of dialysis: hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis.\n4. Kidney transplant: In some cases, a kidney transplant may be an option. This involves surgically implanting a healthy kidney from a donor into your body.\n\nIt's important to discuss all treatment options with your healthcare provider to determine the best course of action for your specific situation.",
        "original_answer": "All of the treatment options for kidney failure require changes and restrictions in your diet.\n                \nHemodialysis\n                \nHemodialysis has the most restrictions. You should watch how much water and other liquids you get from food and drinks and avoid getting too much sodium, often from salt; potassium; and phosphorus. You may find it difficult to limit phosphorus because many foods that are high in phosphorus also provide the protein you need. Hemodialysis can remove protein from the body, so you should eat foods with high-quality protein, such as meat, fish, and eggs. Limit your phosphorus by avoiding foods such as beans, peas, nuts, tea, and colas. You may also need to take a pill called a phosphate binder that keeps phosphorus in your food from entering your bloodstream. Talk with your dialysis centers dietitian to find a hemodialysis meal plan that works for you.\n                \nMore information about nutrition for people who are on hemodialysis is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Eat Right to Feel Right on Hemodialysis.\n                \nPeritoneal Dialysis\n                \nLike hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis requires limits on sodium and phosphorus. You may need to take a phosphate binder. The liquid limitations in peritoneal dialysis may not be as strict as those for hemodialysis. In fact, you may need to drink more water and other liquids if your peritoneal dialysis treatments remove too much fluid from your body. Peritoneal dialysis removes potassium from the body, so you may need to eat potassium-rich foods such as potatoes, tomatoes, oranges, and bananas. However, be careful not to eat too much potassium because it can cause an unsteady heartbeat. Peritoneal dialysis removes even more protein than hemodialysis, so eating foods with high-quality protein is important. You may need to limit calories because your body absorbs sugar from the dialysis solution.\n                \nKidney Transplantation\n                \nKidney transplantation has the fewest restrictions on your diet. You should limit sodium because it can raise your blood pressure. Medicines that you take after the transplant can cause you to gain weight, so you may need to limit calories.\n                \nConservative Management\n                \nThe diet for conservative management limits protein. Protein breaks down into waste products the kidneys must remove. Limiting protein may reduce the amount of work the kidneys have to do so they will last longer.\n                \n\n                \nHemodialysis    Peritoneal Dialysis    Kidney Transplantation                 In Center                 Home                 CAPD                 CCPD                 Deceased                 Living                     Schedule                 Three treatments a week for 3 to 5 hours or more.

        "original_answer": "The urinary tract is the bodys drainage system for removing wastes and extra water. The urinary tract includes two kidneys, two ureters, a bladder, and a urethra. The kidneys are two bean-shaped organs, each about the size of a fist. They are located near the middle of the back, just below the rib cage, one on each side of the spine. Every day, the two kidneys process about 200 quarts of blood to produce about 1 to 2 quarts of urine, composed of wastes and extra water. Children produce less urine than adults. The amount produced depends on their age. The urine flows from the kidneys to the bladder through tubes called the ureters. The bladder stores urine until releasing it through urination. When the bladder empties, urine flows out of the body through a tube called the urethra at the bottom of the bladder.",

        "original_answer": "People most at risk for pyelonephritis are those who have a bladder infection and those with a structural, or anatomic, problem in the urinary tract. Urine normally flows only in one directionfrom the kidneys to the bladder. However, the flow of urine may be blocked in people with a structural defect of the urinary tract, a kidney stone, or an enlarged prostatethe walnut-shaped gland in men that surrounds the urethra at the neck of the bladder and supplies fluid that goes into semen. Urine can also back up, or reflux, into one or both kidneys. This problem, which is called vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), happens when the valve mechanism that normally prevents backward flow of urine is not working properly. VUR is most commonly diagnosed during childhood. Pregnant women and people with diabetes or a weakened immune system are also at increased risk of pyelonephritis.",

Here are the steps to diagnose pyelonephritis:\n\n1. Medical history and symptoms: The doctor will ask about your symptoms, such as fever, chills, abdominal or back pain, nausea, or vomiting. They will also ask about any medical conditions you have, any medications you are taking, and any recent urinary tract infections.\n2. Physical examination: The doctor will perform a physical examination, including checking your temperature, blood pressure, and heart rate. They may also perform a pelvic or rectal examination to check for tenderness or masses.\n3. Urinalysis: A urinalysis is a test that examines a sample of your urine for signs of infection, such as white blood cells, red blood cells, and bacteria.\n4. Urine culture: A urine culture is a test that grows bacteria from your urine in a laboratory to identify the specific type of bacteria causing the infection. This test can also determine the most effective antibiotic to treat the infection.\n5. Imaging tests: In some cases, the doctor may order imaging tests, such as an ultrasound, CT scan, or MRI, to visualize the kidneys and urinary tract and rule out any other conditions.\n\nIf you experience any symptoms of a kidney infection, it is important to seek medical attention promptly. Early diagnosis and treatment can help prevent complications and reduce the risk of kidney damage.",
        "original_answer": "The tests used to diagnose pyelonephritis depend on the patients age, gender, and response to treatment and include the following:\n                \n- Urinalysis. Urinalysis is testing of a urine sample. The urine sample is collected in a special container in a health care providers office or commercial facility and can be tested in the same location or sent to a lab for analysis. The presence of white blood cells and bacteria in the urine indicate infection.  - Urine culture. A urine culture is performed by placing part of a urine sample in a tube or dish with a substance that encourages any bacteria present to grow. The urine sample is collected in a special container in a health care providers office or commercial facility and sent to a lab for culture. Once the bacteria have multiplied, which usually takes 1 to 3 days, they can be identified. The health care provider can then determine the best treatment.  - Ultrasound. Ultrasound uses a device, called a transducer, that bounces safe, painless sound waves off organs to create an image of their structure. The procedure is performed in a health care providers office, outpatient center, or hospital by a specially trained technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologista doctor who specializes in medical imaging; anesthesia is not needed. The images can show obstructions in the urinary tract. Ultrasound is often used for people who do not respond to treatment within 72 hours.  - Computerized tomography (CT) scan. CT scans use a combination of x rays and computer technology to create three-dimensional (3-D) images. A CT scan may include the injection of a special dye, called contrast medium. CT scans require the person to lie on a table that slides into a tunnel-shaped device where the x rays are taken. The procedure is performed in an outpatient center or hospital by an x-ray technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologist. Anesthesia is not needed. CT scans can show obstructions in the urinary tract. The test is often used for people who do not respond to treatment within 72 hours.  - Voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG). A VCUG is an x-ray image of the bladder and urethra taken while the bladder is full and during urination, also called voiding. The procedure is performed in an outpatient center or hospital by an x-ray technician supervised by a radiologist, who then interprets the images. Anesthesia is not needed, but sedation may be used for some people. The bladder and urethra are filled with contrast medium to make the structures clearly visible on the x-ray images. The x-ray machine captures images of the contrast medium while the bladder is full and when the person urinates. This test can show abnormalities of the inside of the urethra and bladder and is usually used to detect VUR in children.  - Digital rectal examination (DRE). A DRE is a physical exam of the prostate that is performed in the health care providers office. Anesthesia is not needed. To perform the exam, the health care provider asks the person to bend over a table or lie on his side while holding his knees close to his chest. The health care provider slides a gloved, lubricated finger into the rectum and feels the part of the prostate that lies in front of the rectum. Men with suspected pyelonephritis may have a DRE to determine whether a swollen prostate may be obstructing the neck of the bladder.  - Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy. DMSA scintigraphy is an imaging technique that relies on the detection of small amounts of radiation after injection of radioactive material. Because the dose of radioactive material is small, the risk of causing damage to cells is low. The procedure is performed in an outpatient center or hospital by a specially trained technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologist. Anesthesia is not needed. Radioactive material is injected into a vein in the persons arm and travels through the body to the kidneys. Special cameras and computers are used to create images of the radioactive material as it passes through the kidneys. The radioactive material makes the parts of the kidney that are infected or scarred stand out on the image. DMSA scintigraphy is used to show the severity of kidney infection or kidney damage, such as scarring.",

While a urine sample is sent to a lab for culture, the health care provider may begin treatment with an antibiotic that fights the most common types of bacteria. Once culture results are known and the bacteria is clearly identified, the health care provider may switch the antibiotic to one that more effectively targets the bacteria. Antibiotics may be given through a vein, orally, or both. Urinary tract obstructions are often treated with surgery.\n                \nSeverely ill patients may be hospitalized and limited to bed rest until they can take the fluids and medications they need on their own. Fluids and medications may be given intravenously during this time.\n                \nIn adults, repeat urine cultures should be performed after treatment has ended to make sure the infection does not recur. If a repeat test shows infection, another 14-day course of antibiotics is prescribed; if infection recurs again, antibiotics are prescribed for 6 weeks.",

Laboratory tests: These may include blood tests to check liver function, immune system activity, and viral infections. Autoimmune hepatitis is often associated with elevated levels of certain autoantibodies.\n\n4. Liver biopsy: If the diagnosis is uncertain after non-invasive tests, a biopsy may be needed. This involves removing a small piece of liver tissue for examination under a microscope.\n\nIt's important to note that autoimmune hepatitis can be difficult to diagnose and may require the expertise of a specialist, such as a gastroenterologist or hepatologist.",
        "original_answer": "A health care provider will make a diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis based on symptoms, a physical exam, blood tests, and a liver biopsy.\n                \nA health care provider performs a physical exam and reviews the person's health history, including the use of alcohol and medications that can harm the liver. A person usually needs blood tests for an exact diagnosis because a person with autoimmune hepatitis can have the same symptoms as those of other liver diseases or metabolic disorders.\n                \nBlood tests. A blood test involves drawing blood at a health care provider's office or a commercial facility and sending the sample to a lab for analysis. A person will need blood tests for autoantibodies to help distinguish autoimmune hepatitis from other liver diseases that have similar symptoms, such as viral hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, steatohepatitis, or Wilson disease.\n                \nLiver biopsy. A liver biopsy is a procedure that involves taking a piece of liver tissue for examination with a microscope for signs of damage or disease. The health care provider may ask the patient to temporarily stop taking certain medications before the liver biopsy. He or she may also ask the patient to fast for 8 hours before the procedure.\n                \nDuring the procedure, the patient lies on a table, right hand resting above the head. A health care provider will apply a local anesthetic to the area where he or she will insert the biopsy needle. If needed, he or she will give sedatives and pain medication. Then, he or she will use a needle to take a small piece of liver tissue, and may use ultrasound, computerized tomography scans, or other imaging techniques to guide the needle. After the biopsy, the patient must lie on the right side for up to 2 hours and is monitored an additional 2 to 4 hours before being sent home.\n                \nA health care provider performs a liver biopsy at a hospital or an outpatient center.

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Autoimmune hepatitis is typically treated with medications that reduce inflammation and suppress the immune system's abnormal response. The most common treatments are:\n\n1. Corticosteroids, such as prednisone, which can reduce inflammation and suppress the immune system.\n2. Immunosuppressive drugs, such as azathioprine, which can help maintain remission and allow for lower doses of corticosteroids.\n\nIn some cases, a combination of these medications may be used. Treatment usually continues for several years, and the goal is to reduce inflammation, prevent complications, and achieve long-term remission. Regular monitoring and adjustment of medication may be necessary. In severe cases or when other treatments are not effective, a liver transplant may be considered.",
        "original_answer": "Treatment for autoimmune hepatitis includes medication to suppress, or slow down, an overactive immune system. Treatment may also include a liver transplant.\n                \nTreatment works best when autoimmune hepatitis is diagnosed early. People with autoimmune hepatitis generally respond to standard treatment and the disease can be controlled in most cases. Long-term response to treatment can stop the disease from getting worse and may even reverse some damage to the liver.\n                \nMedications\n                \nPeople with autoimmune hepatitis who have no symptoms or a mild form of the disease may or may not need to take medication. A health care provider will determine if a person needs treatment. In some people with mild autoimmune hepatitis, the disease may go into remission. Remission is a period when a person is symptom-free and blood tests and liver biopsy show improvement in liver function.\n                \nCorticosteroids. Corticosteroids are medications that decrease swelling and reduce the activity of the immune system. Health care providers treat both types of autoimmune hepatitis with a daily dose of a corticosteroid called prednisone. Treatment may begin with a high dose that is gradually lowered as the disease is controlled. The treatment goal is to find the lowest possible dose that helps control the disease.\n                \nSide effects of prednisone may include\n                \n- weight gain  - weakness of the bones, called osteoporosis or osteomalacia  - thinning of the hair and skin  - acne  - diabetes  - high blood pressure  - cataracts, a clouding in the lens of the eyes  - glaucoma, elevated pressure in the eyes  - anxiety and confusion\n                \nA health care provider will closely monitor and manage any side effects that may occur, as high doses of prednisone are often prescribed to treat autoimmune hepatitis.\n                \nImmune system suppressors. Medications that suppress the immune system prevent the body from making autoantibodies and block the immune reaction that contributes to inflammation. In most cases, health care providers use azathioprine (Azasan, Imuran) in conjunction with prednisone to treat autoimmune hepatitis. When using azathioprine, a health care provider can use a lower dose of prednisone, which may reduce prednisone's side effects.\n                \nSide effects of azathioprine include\n                \n- low white blood cell count  - nausea  - vomiting  - skin rash  - liver damage  - pancreatitis, or inflammation of the pancreas\n                \nAzathioprine is an immune system suppressor, so people taking the medication should undergo routine blood tests to monitor their white blood cell counts. A low white blood cell count can lead to bone marrow failure. Bone marrow is the tissue found inside bones that produces new blood cells, including platelets. A health care provider will also check the platelet count when blood tests are done.\n                \nA person may need to discontinue prednisone or azathioprine if they cause severe side effects. The risk of side effects is higher in people who also have cirrhosis.\n                \nA health care provider may gradually reduce the dose of medication in people who show improvement, although the symptoms can return. When a person discontinues treatment, a health care provider will perform routine blood tests and carefully monitor the person's condition for a return of symptoms. Treatment with low doses of prednisone or azathioprine may be necessary on and off for many years.\n                \nPeople who do not respond to standard immune therapy or who have severe side effects from the medications may benefit from other immunosuppressive agents such as mycophenolate mofetil (CellCept), cyclosporine, or tacrolimus (Hecoria, Prograf).\n                \nMedications that suppress the immune system may lead to various forms of cancer. People on low doses of azathioprine for long periods of time are at slight risk of developing cancer.\n                \nLiver Transplant\n                \nIn some people, autoimmune hepatitis progresses to cirrhosis and end-stage liver failure, and a liver transplant may be necessary. Symptoms of cirrhosis and liver failure include the symptoms of autoimmune hepatitis and\n                \n- generalized itching  - a longer-than-usual amount of time for bleeding to stop  - easy bruising  - a swollen stomach or swollen ankles  - spiderlike blood vessels, called spider angiomas, that develop on the skin  - abdominal bloating due to an enlarged liver  - fluid in the abdomenalso called ascites  - forgetfulness or confusion\n                \nLiver transplant is surgery to remove a diseased or an injured liver and replace it with a healthy one from another person, called a donor. A team of surgeons performs a liver transplant in a hospital. When possible, the patient fasts for 8 hours before the surgery. The patient stays in the hospital about 1 to 2 weeks to be sure the transplanted liver is functioning properly. The health care provider will monitor the patient for bleeding, infections, and signs of liver rejection. The patient will take prescription medications long term to prevent infections and rejection. Liver transplant surgery for autoimmune hepatitis is successful in most cases.\n                \nMore information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Liver Transplantation.",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Autoimmune hepatitis is a condition where the body's immune system attacks the liver, causing inflammation and damage. If you suspect you have autoimmune hepatitis, it's important to see a doctor for a proper diagnosis and treatment.\n\nTreatment typically involves medications to suppress the immune system and reduce inflammation, such as:\n\n1. Corticosteroids (e.g. prednisone)\n2. Immunosuppressants (e.g. azathioprine)\n\nIn addition to medication, your doctor may recommend lifestyle changes such as:\n\n1. Avoiding alcohol and other substances that can harm the liver\n2. Eating a healthy and balanced diet\n3. Getting regular exercise\n4. Managing stress\n\nIt's important to work closely with your doctor to develop a personalized treatment plan and to monitor your progress regularly. With appropriate treatment, autoimmune hepatitis can be managed effectively and complications can be prevented.",
        "original_answer": "- Autoimmune hepatitis is a chronicor long lastingdisease in which the body's immune system attacks the liver and causes inflammation and damage.  - Autoimmune hepatitis is a serious condition that may worsen over time if not treated. Autoimmune hepatitis can lead to cirrhosis and liver failure.  - Autoimmune hepatitis is more common in females. The disease can occur at any age and affects all ethnic groups.  - Autoimmune hepatitis is classified as type 1 or type 2.  - A health care provider will make a diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis based on symptoms, a physical exam, blood tests, and a liver biopsy.  - A person usually needs blood tests for an exact diagnosis because a person with autoimmune hepatitis can have the same symptoms as those of other liver diseases or metabolic disorders.  - Treatment for autoimmune hepatitis includes medication to suppress, or slow down, an overactive immune system.  - Treatment works best when autoimmune hepatitis is diagnosed early.  - People with autoimmune hepatitis generally respond to standard treatment and the disease can be controlled in most cases.  - In some people, autoimmune hepatitis progresses to cirrhosis and end-stage liver failure, and a liver transplant may be necessary.",

It is often a precursor to type 2 diabetes and can be diagnosed through the same tests used to diagnose diabetes.\n\nHere are the specific criteria for diagnosing diabetes and prediabetes:\n\nDiabetes:\n\n* Fasting plasma glucose level of 126 mg/dL or higher on two separate occasions\n* Hemoglobin A1C level of 6.5% or higher\n* Random plasma glucose level of 200 mg/dL or higher, along with symptoms of diabetes (such as increased thirst, frequent urination, and fatigue)\n\nPrediabetes:\n\n* Fasting plasma glucose level of 100-125 mg/dL\n* Hemoglobin A1C level of 5.7-6.4%\n* Oral glucose tolerance test result of 140-199 mg/dL after two hours\n\nIt is important to note that these criteria may vary slightly depending on the source and the specific guidelines being followed. If you are concerned about your blood sugar levels, it is important to speak with a healthcare provider for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan.",
        "original_answer": "Diabetes is a complex group of diseases with a variety of causes. People with diabetes have high blood glucose, also called high blood sugar or hyperglycemia.\n                \nDiabetes is a disorder of metabolismthe way the body uses digested food for energy. The digestive tract breaks down carbohydratessugars and starches found in many foodsinto glucose, a form of sugar that enters the bloodstream. With the help of the hormone insulin, cells throughout the body absorb glucose and use it for energy. Insulin is made in the pancreas, an organ located behind the stomach. As the blood glucose level rises after a meal, the pancreas is triggered to release insulin. Within the pancreas, clusters of cells called islets contain beta cells, which make the insulin and release it into the blood.\n                \nDiabetes develops when the body doesnt make enough insulin or is not able to use insulin effectively, or both. As a result, glucose builds up in the blood instead of being absorbed by cells in the body. The bodys cells are then starved of energy despite high blood glucose levels.\n                \nOver time, high blood glucose damages nerves and blood vessels, leading to complications such as heart disease, stroke, kidney disease, blindness, dental disease, and amputations. Other complications of diabetes may include increased susceptibility to other diseases, loss of mobility with aging, depression, and pregnancy problems.\n                \nMain Types of Diabetes\n                \nThe three main types of diabetes are type 1, type 2, and gestational diabetes:\n                \n- Type 1 diabetes, formerly called juvenile diabetes, is usually first diagnosed in children, teenagers, and young adults. In this type of diabetes, the beta cells of the pancreas no longer make insulin because the bodys immune system has attacked and destroyed them.  - Type 2 diabetes, formerly called adult-onset diabetes, is the most common type of diabetes. About 90 to 95 percent of people with diabetes have type 2.1 People can develop type 2 diabetes at any age, even during childhood, but this type of diabetes is most often associated with older age. Type 2 diabetes is also associated with excess weight, physical inactivity, family history of diabetes, previous history of gestational diabetes, and certain ethnicities.   Type 2 diabetes usually begins with insulin resistance, a condition linked to excess weight in which muscle, liver, and fat cells do not use insulin properly. As a result, the body needs more insulin to help glucose enter cells to be used for energy. At first, the pancreas keeps up with the added demand by producing more insulin. But in time, the pancreas loses its ability to produce enough insulin in response to meals, and blood glucose levels rise.  - Gestational diabetes is a type of diabetes that develops only during pregnancy.  The hormones produced during pregnancy increase the amount of insulin needed to control blood glucose levels. If the body cant meet this increased need for insulin, women can develop gestational diabetes during the late stages of pregnancy.  Gestational diabetes usually goes away after the baby is born. Shortly after pregnancy, 5 to 10 percent of women with gestational diabetes continue to have high blood glucose levels and are diagnosed as having diabetes, usually type 2.1 Research has shown that lifestyle changes and the diabetes medication, metformin, can reduce or delay the risk of type 2 diabetes in these women. Babies born to mothers who had gestational diabetes are also more likely to develop obesity and type 2 diabetes as they grow up.  More information about gestational diabetes is provided in the NIDDK health topic, What I need to know about Gestational Diabetes,or by calling 18008608747.\n                \nOther Types of Diabetes\n                \nMany other types of diabetes exist, and a person can exhibit characteristics of more than one type. For example, in latent autoimmune diabetes in adults, people show signs of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Other types of diabetes include those caused by genetic defects, diseases of the pancreas, excess amounts of certain hormones resulting from some medical conditions, medications that reduce insulin action, chemicals that destroy beta cells, infections, rare autoimmune disorders, and genetic syndromes associated with diabetes.\n                \nMore information about other types of diabetes is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Causes of Diabetes, or by calling 18008608747.",

        "original_answer": "Blood tests are used to diagnosis diabetes and prediabetes because early in the disease type 2 diabetes may have no symptoms. All diabetes blood tests involve drawing blood at a health care providers office or commercial facility and sending the sample to a lab for analysis. Lab analysis of blood is needed to ensure test results are accurate. Glucose measuring devices used in a health care providers office, such as finger-stick devices, are not accurate enough for diagnosis but may be used as a quick indicator of high blood glucose.\n                \nTesting enables health care providers to find and treat diabetes before complications occur and to find and treat prediabetes, which can delay or prevent type 2 diabetes from developing.\n                \nAny one of the following tests can be used for diagnosis:*\n                \n- an A1C test, also called the hemoglobin A1c, HbA1c, or glycohemoglobin test  - a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) test  - an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)\n                \n*Not all tests are recommended for diagnosing all types of diabetes. See the individual test descriptions for details.\n                \nAnother blood test, the random plasma glucose (RPG) test, is sometimes used to diagnose diabetes during a regular health checkup. If the RPG measures 200 milligrams per deciliter or above, and the individual also shows symptoms of diabetes, then a health care provider may diagnose diabetes.\n                \nSymptoms of diabetes include\n                \n- increased urination  - increased thirst  - unexplained weight loss\n                \nOther symptoms can include fatigue, blurred vision, increased hunger, and sores that do not heal.\n                \nAny test used to diagnose diabetes requires confirmation with a second measurement unless clear symptoms of diabetes exist.\n                \nThe following table provides the blood test levels for diagnosis of diabetes for nonpregnant adults and diagnosis of prediabetes.\n                \nA1C Test\n                \nThe A1C test is used to detect type 2 diabetes and prediabetes but is not recommended for diagnosis of type 1 diabetes or gestational diabetes. The A1C test is a blood test that reflects the average of a persons blood glucose levels over the past 3 months and does not show daily fluctuations. The A1C test is more convenient for patients than the traditional glucose tests because it does not require fasting and can be performed at any time of the day.\n                \nThe A1C test result is reported as a percentage. The higher the percentage, the higher a persons blood glucose levels have been. A normal A1C level is below 5.7 percent.\n                \nAn A1C of 5.7 to 6.4 percent indicates prediabetes. People diagnosed with prediabetes may be retested in 1 year. People with an A1C below 5.7 percent maystill be at risk for diabetes, depending on the presence of other characteristics that put them at risk, also known as risk factors. People with an A1C above 6.0 percent should be considered at very high risk of developing diabetes. A level of 6.5 percent or above means a person has diabetes.\n                \nLaboratory analysis. When the A1C test is used for diagnosis, the blood sample must be sent to a laboratory using a method that is certified by the NGSP to ensure the results are standardized. Blood samples analyzed in a health care providers office, known as point-of-care tests, are not standardized for diagnosing diabetes.\n                \nAbnormal results. The A1C test can be unreliable for diagnosing or monitoring diabetes in people with certain conditions known to interfere with the results. Interference should be suspected when A1C results seem very different from the results of a blood glucose test. People of African, Mediterranean, or Southeast Asian descent or people with family members with sickle cell anemia or a thalassemia are particularly at risk of interference.\n                \nHowever, not all of the A1C tests are unreliable for people with these diseases. The NGSP provides information about which A1C tests are appropriate to use for specific types of interference and details on any problems with the A1C test at www.ngsp.org.\n                \nFalse A1C test results may also occur in people with other problems that affect their blood or hemoglobin such as chronic kidney disease, liver disease, or anemia.\n                \nMore information about limitations of the A1C test and different forms of sickle cell anemia is provided in the NIDDK health topic, For People of African, Mediterranean, or Southeast Asian Heritage: Important Information about Diabetes Blood Tests, or by calling 18008608747.\n                \nChanges in Diagnostic Testing\n                \nIn the past, the A1C test was used to monitor blood glucose levels but not for diagnosis. The A1C test has now been standardized, and in 2009, an international expert committee recommended it be used for diagnosis of type 2 diabetes and prediabetes.2\n                \nMore information about the A1C test is provided in the NIDDK health topic, The A1C Test and Diabetes, or by calling 18008608747.\n                \nFasting Plasma Glucose Test\n                \nThe FPG test is used to detect diabetes and prediabetes. The FPG test has been the most common test used for diagnosing diabetes because it is more convenient than the OGTT and less expensive. The FPG test measures blood glucose in a person who has fasted for at least 8 hours and is most reliable when given in the morning.\n                \nPeople with a fasting glucose level of 100 to 125 mg/dL have impaired fasting glucose (IFG), or prediabetes. A level of 126 mg/dL or above, confirmed by repeating the test on another day, means a person has diabetes.\n                \nOral Glucose Tolerance Test\n                \nThe OGTT can be used to diagnose diabetes, prediabetes, and gestational diabetes. Research has shown that the OGTT is more sensitive than the FPG test, but it is less convenient to administer. When used to test for diabetes or prediabetes, the OGTT measures blood glucose after a person fasts for at least 8 hours and 2 hours after the person drinks a liquid containing 75 grams of glucose dissolved in water.\n                \nIf the 2-hour blood glucose level is between 140 and 199 mg/dL, the person has a type of prediabetes called impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). If confirmed by a second test, a 2-hour glucose level of 200 mg/dL or above means a person has diabetes.",

These strategies worked well for both men and women in all racial and ethnic groups, but were especially effective for participants age 60 and older. A follow-up study, the Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study (DPPOS), showed losing weight and being physically active provide lasting results. Ten years after the DPP, modest weight loss delayed onset of type 2 diabetes by an average of 4 years.\n                \nThe diabetes medication metformin also lowers the risk of type 2 diabetes in people with prediabetes, especially those who are younger and heavier and women who have had gestational diabetes.

Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) test: This blood test measures your blood sugar level after an overnight fast. A fasting blood sugar level less than 100 mg/dL is normal. A fasting blood sugar level from 100 to 125 mg/dL is considered prediabetes. If it's 126 mg/dL or higher on two separate tests, you have diabetes.\n4. Oral glucose tolerance test: For this test, you fast overnight, and the fasting blood sugar level is measured. Then you drink a sugary liquid, and blood sugar levels are tested periodically for the next two hours. A blood sugar level less than 140 mg/dL is normal. A reading of more than 200 mg/dL after two hours indicates diabetes. A result between 140 and 199 mg/dL indicates prediabetes.\n\nIf you are diagnosed with diabetes or prediabetes, your doctor will discuss treatment options and lifestyle changes to help manage your condition and reduce the risk of complications.",
        "original_answer": "- Tests used for diagnosing diabetes and prediabetes include the A1C testfor type 2 diabetes and prediabetesthe fasting plasma glucose (FPG) test, and the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Another blood test, the random plasma glucose (RPG) test, is sometimes used to diagnose diabetes when symptoms are present during a regular health checkup.  - Anyone age 45 or older should consider getting tested for diabetes or prediabetes. People younger than 45 should consider testing if they are overweight or obese and have one or more additional risk factors for diabetes.  - If results of testing are normal, testing should be repeated at least every 3 years. Health care providers may recommend more frequent testing depending on initial results and risk status.  - People whose test results indicate they have prediabetes may be tested again in 1 year and should take steps to prevent or delay type 2 diabetes.  - Many people with prediabetes develop type 2 diabetes within 10 years.  - Modest weight loss and moderate physical activity can help people with prediabetes delay or prevent type 2 diabetes.",

        "original_answer": "The thyroid is a 2-inch-long, butterfly-shaped gland weighing less than 1 ounce. Located in the front of the neck below the larynx, or voice box, it has two lobes, one on each side of the windpipe. The thyroid is one of the glands that make up the endocrine system. The glands of the endocrine system produce and store hormones and release them into the bloodstream. The hormones then travel through the body and direct the activity of the bodys cells.\n                \nThe thyroid gland makes two thyroid hormones, triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4). T3 is made from T4 and is the more active hormone, directly affecting the tissues. Thyroid hormones affect metabolism, brain development, breathing, heart and nervous system functions, body temperature, muscle strength, skin dryness, menstrual cycles, weight, and cholesterol levels.",

Congenital hypothyroidism (present at birth)\n7. Pituitary gland damage or disorder\n8. Lack of iodine in the diet (rare in developed countries)\n\nIf you suspect you have hypothyroidism, it's important to consult with a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment.",
        "original_answer": "Hypothyroidism has several causes, including\n                \n- Hashimotos disease  - thyroiditis, or inflammation of the thyroid  - congenital hypothyroidism, or hypothyroidism that is present at birth  - surgical removal of part or all of the thyroid  - radiation treatment of the thyroid  - some medications\n                \nLess commonly, hypothyroidism is caused by too much or too little iodine in the diet or by abnormalities of the pituitary gland.\n                \nHashimotos Disease\n                \nHashimotos disease, also called chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis, is the most common cause of hypothyroidism in the United States.1 Hashimotos disease is a form of chronic inflammation of the thyroid gland. Hashimotos disease is also an autoimmune disorder.\n                \nNormally, the immune system protects the body against foreign invaderssuch as viruses and bacteriathat can cause illness. But in autoimmune diseases, the immune system attacks the bodys own cells and organs. With Hashimotos disease, the immune system attacks the thyroid, causing inflammation and interfering with its ability to produce thyroid hormones.\n                \nMore information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Hashimotos Disease.\n                \nThyroiditis\n                \nThyroiditis causes stored thyroid hormone to leak out of the thyroid gland. At first, the leakage raises hormone levels in the blood, leading to hyperthyroidismwhen thyroid hormone levels are too highthat lasts for 1 or 2 months. Most people then develop hypothyroidism before the thyroid is completely healed.\n                \nSeveral types of thyroiditis can cause hyperthyroidism followed by hypothyroidism:\n                \n- Subacute thyroiditis. This condition involves painful inflammation and enlargement of the thyroid. Experts are not sure what causes subacute thyroiditis, but it may be related to a viral or bacterial infection. The condition usually goes away on its own in a few months.  - Postpartum thyroiditis. This type of thyroiditis develops after a woman gives birth. For more information, see the section titled What happens with pregnancy and thyroid conditions?  - Silent thyroiditis. This type of thyroiditis is called silent because it is painless, as is postpartum thyroiditis, even though the thyroid may be enlarged. Like postpartum thyroiditis, silent thyroiditis is probably an autoimmune condition and sometimes develops into permanent hypothyroidism.\n                \nCongenital Hypothyroidism\n                \nSome babies are born with a thyroid that is not fully developed or does not function properly. If untreated, congenital hypothyroidism can lead to mental retardation and growth failure. Early treatment can prevent these complications, so most newborns in the United States are screened for hypothyroidism.\n                \nSurgical Removal of the Thyroid\n                \nWhen part of the thyroid is removed, the remaining part may produce normal amounts of thyroid hormone, but some people who have this surgery develop hypothyroidism. Removal of the entire thyroid always results in hypothyroidism.\n                \nPart or all of the thyroid may be surgically removed as a treatment for\n                \n- hyperthyroidism  - a large goiter, which is an enlarged thyroid that may cause the neck to appear swollen and can interfere with normal breathing and swallowing  - thyroid nodules, which are noncancerous tumors, called adenomas, or lumps in the thyroid that can produce excess thyroid hormone  - thyroid cancer\n                \nRadiation Treatment of the Thyroid\n                \nRadioactive iodine, a common treatment for hyperthyroidism, gradually destroys the cells of the thyroid. Most people who receive radioactive iodine treatment eventually develop hypothyroidism. People with Hodgkins disease, other lymphomas, and head or neck cancers are treated with radiation, which can also damage the thyroid.\n                \nMedications\n                \nSome drugs can interfere with thyroid hormone production and lead to hypothyroidism, including\n                \n- amiodarone, a heart medication  - interferon alpha, a cancer medication  - lithium, a bipolar disorder medication  - interleukin-2, a kidney cancer medication",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Hypothyroidism is typically diagnosed through a combination of medical history, physical examination, and laboratory tests. During the medical history, the doctor will ask about symptoms such as fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance, and menstrual irregularities. During the physical examination, the doctor may look for signs such as dry skin, thinning hair, and a slow heart rate.\n\nThe most common laboratory test used to diagnose hypothyroidism is a blood test that measures the levels of thyroid hormones (TSH, T3, and T4). If the TSH level is high and the T4 level is low, it is likely that the person has hypothyroidism. Additional tests may be ordered to confirm the diagnosis and determine the cause of the hypothyroidism.\n\nIt is important to note that the diagnosis of hypothyroidism should be made by a qualified healthcare professional, such as a doctor or endocrinologist. If you are experiencing symptoms of hypothyroidism, it is important to speak with a healthcare provider for proper evaluation and treatment.",
        "original_answer": "Many symptoms of hypothyroidism are the same as those of other diseases, so hypothyroidism usually cannot be diagnosed based on symptoms alone. With suspected hypothyroidism, health care providers take a medical history and perform a thorough physical examination. Health care providers may then use several blood tests to confirm a diagnosis of hypothyroidism and find its cause:\n                \nTSH test. The ultrasensitive TSH test is usually the first test a health care provider performs. This test detects even tiny amounts of TSH in the blood and is the most accurate measure of thyroid activity available. Generally, a TSH reading above normal means a person has hypothyroidism and a reading below normal means a person has hyperthyroidism.\n                \nMildly elevated TSH without symptoms indicates subclinical hypothyroidism. Some health care providers treat subclinical hypothyroidism immediately. Others prefer to leave it untreated but monitor their patients for signs that the condition is worsening.\n                \nHealth care providers may conduct additional tests to help confirm the diagnosis or determine the cause of hypothyroidism.\n                \nT4 test. This test measures the actual amount of circulating thyroid hormone in the blood. In hypothyroidism, the level of T4 in the blood is lower than normal.\n                \nThyroid autoantibody test. This test looks for the presence of thyroid autoantibodies. Most people with Hashimotos disease have these antibodies, but people whose hypothyroidism is caused by other conditions do not.\n                \nMore information about testing for thyroid problems is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Thyroid Tests.",

        "original_answer": "Health care providers treat hypothyroidism with synthetic thyroxine, a medication that is identical to the hormone T4. The exact dose will depend on the patients age and weight, the severity of the hypothyroidism, the presence of other health problems, and whether the person is taking other drugs that might interfere with how well the body uses thyroid hormone.\n                \nHealth care providers test TSH levels about 6 to 8 weeks after a patient begins taking thyroid hormone and make any necessary adjustments to the dose. Each time the dose is adjusted, the blood is tested again. Once a stable dose is reached, blood tests are normally repeated in 6 months and then once a year.\n                \nHypothyroidism can almost always be completely controlled with synthetic thyroxine, as long as the recommended dose is taken every day as instructed.",

        "original_answer": "Most UTIs are caused by bacteria that live in the bowel, the part of the digestive tract where stool is changed from liquid to solid. The bacterium Escherichia coli (E. coli) causes most UTIs. The urinary tract has several systems to prevent infection. The points where the ureters attach to the bladder act like one-way valves to prevent urine from backing up, or refluxing, toward the kidneys, and urination washes microbes out of the body. The bodys natural defenses also prevent infection. But despite these safeguards, infections still occur.\n                \nOther factors that may cause a child to get a UTI include the following:\n                \n- Waiting to urinate. Regular urination helps flush away bacteria. Holding urine allows bacteria to grow.  - Making too little urine. A child that doesnt drink enough fluids may not make enough urine to flush away bacteria.  - Constipation. Constipation is a condition in which a child has fewer than two bowel movements a week. Stools can be hard, dry, small, and difficult to pass. The hard stool in the bowel may press against the urinary tract and block the flow of urine, allowing bacteria to grow.\n                \nSome children are just more prone to UTIs than others, just as some children are more prone to getting coughs, colds, or ear infections.",

Age: UTIs are more common in young children, especially those who are not yet toilet trained.\n2. Gender: Girls are more likely to develop UTIs than boys, due to the shorter length of the urethra in females.\n3. Anatomical abnormalities: Children with abnormalities in the urinary tract, such as vesicoureteral reflux or posterior urethral valves, are at increased risk of UTIs.\n4. Constipation: Children who are constipated may be more prone to UTIs.\n5. Poor personal hygiene: Children who do not wipe properly after using the toilet or who do not clean themselves well after a bowel movement may be at increased risk of UTIs.\n\nIf you suspect that your child has a UTI, it is important to seek medical attention promptly. UTIs can lead to serious complications if left untreated, particularly in young children. Your healthcare provider will be able to diagnose and treat your child's UTI, as well as provide guidance on how to reduce the risk of future infections.",
        "original_answer": "Any child can get a UTI, though girls get UTIs more often than boys.\n                \nChildren with a condition called vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) are at higher risk for UTIs. VUR causes urine to reflux at the point where one or both ureters attach to the bladder. When urine stays in the urinary tract, bacteria have a chance to grow and spread. Infants and young children who get a UTI often have VUR.\n                \nBoys younger than 6 months who are not circumcised are at greater risk for a UTI than circumcised boys the same age. Boys who are circumcised have had the foreskin, which is the skin that covers the tip of the penis, removed.",

The type of antibiotic and the duration of treatment will depend on the child's age, the type of bacteria found in the urine, and how severe the infection is.\n\nFor babies and young children, the antibiotics are usually given through an injection or a drip into a vein (intravenously). Older children can take antibiotics by mouth.\n\nIn addition to antibiotics, your child may also need pain relief medicine to help with any discomfort or pain. It's important to make sure your child drinks plenty of fluids to help flush the bacteria out of their urinary system.\n\nIf your child has recurrent UTIs, your doctor may recommend additional tests to check for any underlying conditions that could be causing the infections. Treatment for these conditions may help prevent future UTIs.\n\nIt's important to follow your doctor's instructions carefully and to make sure your child takes all of the antibiotics as prescribed, even if they start to feel better before finishing the medication. This will help ensure that the infection is fully treated and reduce the risk of it coming back.",
        "original_answer": "Bacteria-fighting medicines called antibiotics are used to treat a UTI.

Be sure your child takes every pill or every dose of liquid. Your child should feel better after a couple of days, but the infection might come back if your child stops taking the antibiotic too early.\n                \nYou should let your child drink as much as your child wants. But dont force your child to drink large amounts of fluid. Call your childs health care provider if your child doesnt want to or isnt able to drink.

        "original_answer": "Doctors have found four main types of kidney stones:\n                \n- The most common types of stones contain calcium. Calcium is a normal part of a healthy diet. Calcium that is not used by the bones and muscles goes to the kidneys. In most people, the kidneys flush out the extra calcium with the rest of the urine. People who have calcium stones keep the calcium in their kidneys. The calcium that stays behind joins with other waste products to form a stone. People can have calcium oxalate and calcium phosphate stones. Calcium oxalate stones are more common.  - A uric acid stone may form when the urine contains too much acid. People who eat a lot of meat, fish, and shellfish may get uric acid stones.  - A struvite stone may form after you have a kidney infection.  - Cystine stones result from a genetic disorder, meaning a problem passed from parent to child.

The exact cause of this reaction is unknown, but it is believed to have a genetic component.\n\nType 2 diabetes is caused by a combination of genetic and lifestyle factors. It occurs when the body becomes resistant to insulin or doesn't produce enough insulin to properly regulate blood sugar levels. Risk factors include being overweight, physically inactive, having a family history of the condition, and having high blood pressure or high cholesterol.\n\nGestational diabetes is caused by hormonal changes during pregnancy that make the body less sensitive to insulin. This type of diabetes usually goes away after the baby is born, but women who have had gestational diabetes are at increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes later in life.",
        "original_answer": "Diabetes is a complex group of diseases with a variety of causes. People with diabetes have high blood glucose, also called high blood sugar or hyperglycemia.\n                \nDiabetes is a disorder of metabolismthe way the body uses digested food for energy. The digestive tract breaks down carbohydratessugars and starches found in many foodsinto glucose, a form of sugar that enters the bloodstream. With the help of the hormone insulin, cells throughout the body absorb glucose and use it for energy. Diabetes develops when the body doesnt make enough insulin or is not able to use insulin effectively, or both.\n                \nInsulin is made in the pancreas, an organ located behind the stomach. The pancreas contains clusters of cells called islets. Beta cells within the islets make insulin and release it into the blood.\n                \nIf beta cells dont produce enough insulin, or the body doesnt respond to the insulin that is present, glucose builds up in the blood instead of being absorbed by cells in the body, leading to prediabetes or diabetes. Prediabetes is a condition in which blood glucose levels or A1C levelswhich reflect average blood glucose levelsare higher than normal but not high enough to be diagnosed as diabetes. In diabetes, the bodys cells are starved of energy despite high blood glucose levels.\n                \nOver time, high blood glucose damages nerves and blood vessels, leading to complications such as heart disease, stroke, kidney disease, blindness, dental disease, and amputations. Other complications of diabetes may include increased susceptibility to other diseases, loss of mobility with aging, depression, and pregnancy problems. No one is certain what starts the processes that cause diabetes, but scientists believe genes and environmental factors interact to cause diabetes in most cases.\n                \nThe two main types of diabetes are type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. A third type, gestational diabetes, develops only during pregnancy. Other types of diabetes are caused by defects in specific genes, diseases of the pancreas, certain drugs or chemicals, infections, and other conditions. Some people show signs of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes.",

        "original_answer": "Type 1 diabetes is caused by a lack of insulin due to the destruction of insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. In type 1 diabetesan autoimmune diseasethe bodys immune system attacks and destroys the beta cells. Normally, the immune system protects the body from infection by identifying and destroying bacteria, viruses, and other potentially harmful foreign substances. But in autoimmune diseases, the immune system attacks the bodys own cells. In type 1 diabetes, beta cell destruction may take place over several years, but symptoms of the disease usually develop over a short period of time.\n                \nType 1 diabetes typically occurs in children and young adults, though it can appear at any age. In the past, type 1 diabetes was called juvenile diabetes or insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.\n                \nLatent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) may be a slowly developing kind of type 1 diabetes. Diagnosis usually occurs after age 30. In LADA, as in type 1 diabetes, the bodys immune system destroys the beta cells. At the time of diagnosis, people with LADA may still produce their own insulin, but eventually most will need insulin shots or an insulin pump to control blood glucose levels.\n                \nGenetic Susceptibility\n                \nHeredity plays an important part in determining who is likely to develop type 1 diabetes. Genes are passed down from biological parent to child. Genes carry instructions for making proteins that are needed for the bodys cells to function. Many genes, as well as interactions among genes, are thought to influence susceptibility to and protection from type 1 diabetes. The key genes may vary in different population groups. Variations in genes that affect more than 1 percent of a population group are called gene variants.\n                \nCertain gene variants that carry instructions for making proteins called human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) on white blood cells are linked to the risk of developing type 1 diabetes. The proteins produced by HLA genes help determine whether the immune system recognizes a cell as part of the body or as foreign material. Some combinations of HLA gene variants predict that a person will be at higher risk for type 1 diabetes, while other combinations are protective or have no effect on risk.\n                \nWhile HLA genes are the major risk genes for type 1 diabetes, many additional risk genes or gene regions have been found. Not only can these genes help identify people at risk for type 1 diabetes, but they also provide important clues to help scientists better understand how the disease develops and identify potential targets for therapy and prevention.\n                \nGenetic testing can show what types of HLA genes a person carries and can reveal other genes linked to diabetes. However, most genetic testing is done in a research setting and is not yet available to individuals. Scientists are studying how the results of genetic testing can be used to improve type 1 diabetes prevention or treatment.\n                \nAutoimmune Destruction of Beta Cells\n                \nIn type 1 diabetes, white blood cells called T cells attack and destroy beta cells. The process begins well before diabetes symptoms appear and continues after diagnosis. Often, type 1 diabetes is not diagnosed until most beta cells have already been destroyed. At this point, a person needs daily insulin treatment to survive. Finding ways to modify or stop this autoimmune process and preserve beta cell function is a major focus of current scientific research.\n                \nRecent research suggests insulin itself may be a key trigger of the immune attack on beta cells. The immune systems of people who are susceptible to developing type 1 diabetes respond to insulin as if it were a foreign substance, or antigen. To combat antigens, the body makes proteins called antibodies. Antibodies to insulin and other proteins produced by beta cells are found in people with type 1 diabetes. Researchers test for these antibodies to help identify people at increased risk of developing the disease. Testing the types and levels of antibodies in the blood can help determine whether a person has type 1 diabetes, LADA, or another type of diabetes.\n                \nEnvironmental Factors\n                \nEnvironmental factors, such as foods, viruses, and toxins, may play a role in the development of type 1 diabetes, but the exact nature of their role has not been determined. Some theories suggest that environmental factors trigger the autoimmune destruction of beta cells in people with a genetic susceptibility to diabetes. Other theories suggest that environmental factors play an ongoing role in diabetes, even after diagnosis.\n                \nViruses and infections. A virus cannot cause diabetes on its own, but people are sometimes diagnosed with type 1 diabetes during or after a viral infection, suggesting a link between the two. Also, the onset of type 1 diabetes occurs more frequently during the winter when viral infections are more common. Viruses possibly associated with type 1 diabetes include coxsackievirus B, cytomegalovirus, adenovirus, rubella, and mumps. Scientists have described several ways these viruses may damage or destroy beta cells or possibly trigger an autoimmune response in susceptible people. For example, anti-islet antibodies have been found in patients with congenital rubella syndrome, and cytomegalovirus has been associated with significant beta cell damage and acute pancreatitisinflammation of the pancreas. Scientists are trying to identify a virus that can cause type 1 diabetes so that a vaccine might be developed to prevent the disease.\n                \nInfant feeding practices. Some studies have suggested that dietary factors may raise or lower the risk of developing type 1 diabetes. For example, breastfed infants and infants receiving vitamin D supplements may have a reduced risk of developing type 1 diabetes, while early exposure to cows milk and cereal proteins may increase risk. More research is needed to clarify how infant nutrition affects the risk for type 1 diabetes.\n                \nRead more in the Centers for Disease Control and Preventions (CDCs) publication  National Diabetes Statistics Report, 2014 at  www.cdc.gov for information about research studies related to type 1 diabetes.",

        "original_answer": "Type 2 diabetesthe most common form of diabetesis caused by a combination of factors, including insulin resistance, a condition in which the bodys muscle, fat, and liver cells do not use insulin effectively. Type 2 diabetes develops when the body can no longer produce enough insulin to compensate for the impaired ability to use insulin. Symptoms of type 2 diabetes may develop gradually and can be subtle; some people with type 2 diabetes remain undiagnosed for years.\n                \nType 2 diabetes develops most often in middle-aged and older people who are also overweight or obese. The disease, once rare in youth, is becoming more common in overweight and obese children and adolescents. Scientists think genetic susceptibility and environmental factors are the most likely triggers of type 2 diabetes.\n                \nGenetic Susceptibility\n                \nGenes play a significant part in susceptibility to type 2 diabetes. Having certain genes or combinations of genes may increase or decrease a persons risk for developing the disease. The role of genes is suggested by the high rate of type 2 diabetes in families and identical twins and wide variations in diabetes prevalence by ethnicity. Type 2 diabetes occurs more frequently in African Americans, Alaska Natives, American Indians, Hispanics/Latinos, and some Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islander Americans than it does in non-Hispanic whites.\n                \nRecent studies have combined genetic data from large numbers of people, accelerating the pace of gene discovery. Though scientists have now identified many gene variants that increase susceptibility to type 2 diabetes, the majority have yet to be discovered. The known genes appear to affect insulin production rather than insulin resistance. Researchers are working to identify additional gene variants and to learn how they interact with one another and with environmental factors to cause diabetes.\n                \nStudies have shown that variants of the TCF7L2 gene increase susceptibility to type 2 diabetes. For people who inherit two copies of the variants, the risk of developing type 2 diabetes is about 80 percent higher than for those who do not carry the gene variant.1 However, even in those with the variant, diet and physical activity leading to weight loss help delay diabetes, according to the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), a major clinical trial involving people at high risk.\n                \nGenes can also increase the risk of diabetes by increasing a persons tendency to become overweight or obese. One theory, known as the thrifty gene hypothesis, suggests certain genes increase the efficiency of metabolism to extract energy from food and store the energy for later use. This survival trait was advantageous for populations whose food supplies were scarce or unpredictable and could help keep people alive during famine. In modern times, however, when high-calorie foods are plentiful, such a trait can promote obesity and type 2 diabetes.\n                \nObesity and Physical Inactivity\n                \nPhysical inactivity and obesity are strongly associated with the development of type 2 diabetes. People who are genetically susceptible to type 2 diabetes are more vulnerable when these risk factors are present.\n                \nAn imbalance between caloric intake and physical activity can lead to obesity, which causes insulin resistance and is common in people with type 2 diabetes. Central obesity, in which a person has excess abdominal fat, is a major risk factor not only for insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes but also for heart and blood vessel disease, also called cardiovascular disease (CVD). This excess belly fat produces hormones and other substances that can cause harmful, chronic effects in the body such as damage to blood vessels.\n                \nThe DPP and other studies show that millions of people can lower their risk for type 2 diabetes by making lifestyle changes and losing weight. The DPP proved that people with prediabetesat high risk of developing type 2 diabetescould sharply lower their risk by losing weight through regular physical activity and a diet low in fat and calories. In 2009, a follow-up study of DPP participantsthe Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study (DPPOS)showed that the benefits of weight loss lasted for at least 10 years after the original study began.2\n                \nRead more about the DPP, funded under National Institutes of Health (NIH) clinical trial number NCT00004992, and the DPPOS, funded under NIH clinical trial number NCT00038727 in  Diabetes Prevention Program.\n                \nInsulin Resistance\n                \nInsulin resistance is a common condition in people who are overweight or obese, have excess abdominal fat, and are not physically active. Muscle, fat, and liver cells stop responding properly to insulin, forcing the pancreas to compensate by producing extra insulin. As long as beta cells are able to produce enough insulin, blood glucose levels stay in the normal range. But when insulin production falters because of beta cell dysfunction, glucose levels rise, leading to prediabetes or diabetes.\n                \nAbnormal Glucose Production by the Liver\n                \nIn some people with diabetes, an abnormal increase in glucose production by the liver also contributes to high blood glucose levels. Normally, the pancreas releases the hormone glucagon when blood glucose and insulin levels are low. Glucagon stimulates the liver to produce glucose and release it into the bloodstream. But when blood glucose and insulin levels are high after a meal, glucagon levels drop, and the liver stores excess glucose for later, when it is needed. For reasons not completely understood, in many people with diabetes, glucagon levels stay higher than needed. High glucagon levels cause the liver to produce unneeded glucose, which contributes to high blood glucose levels. Metformin, the most commonly used drug to treat type 2 diabetes, reduces glucose production by the liver.\n                \nThe Roles of Insulin and Glucagon in Normal Blood Glucose Regulation\n                \nA healthy persons body keeps blood glucose levels in a normal range through several complex mechanisms. Insulin and glucagon, two hormones made in the pancreas, help regulate blood glucose levels:\n                \n- Insulin, made by beta cells, lowers elevated blood glucose levels.  - Glucagon, made by alpha cells, raises low blood glucose levels.\n                \n- Insulin helps muscle, fat, and liver cells absorb glucose from the bloodstream, lowering blood glucose levels.  - Insulin stimulates the liver and muscle tissue to store excess glucose. The stored form of glucose is called glycogen.  - Insulin also lowers blood glucose levels by reducing glucose production in the liver.\n                \n- Glucagon signals the liver and muscle tissue to break down glycogen into glucose, which enters the bloodstream and raises blood glucose levels.  - If the body needs more glucose, glucagon stimulates the liver to make glucose from amino acids.\n                \nMetabolic Syndrome\n                \nMetabolic syndrome, also called insulin resistance syndrome, refers to a group of conditions common in people with insulin resistance, including\n                \n- higher than normal blood glucose levels  - increased waist size due to excess abdominal fat  - high blood pressure  - abnormal levels of cholesterol and triglycerides in the blood\n                \nCell Signaling and Regulation\n                \nCells communicate through a complex network of molecular signaling pathways. For example, on cell surfaces, insulin receptor molecules capture, or bind, insulin molecules circulating in the bloodstream. This interaction between insulin and its receptor prompts the biochemical signals that enable the cells to absorb glucose from the blood and use it for energy.\n                \nProblems in cell signaling systems can set off a chain reaction that leads to diabetes or other diseases. Many studies have focused on how insulin signals cells to communicate and regulate action. Researchers have identified proteins and pathways that transmit the insulin signal and have mapped interactions between insulin and body tissues, including the way insulin helps the liver control blood glucose levels. Researchers have also found that key signals also come from fat cells, which produce substances that cause inflammation and insulin resistance.\n                \nThis work holds the key to combating insulin resistance and diabetes. As scientists learn more about cell signaling systems involved in glucose regulation, they will have more opportunities to develop effective treatments.\n                \nBeta Cell Dysfunction\n                \nScientists think beta cell dysfunction is a key contributor to type 2 diabetes. Beta cell impairment can cause inadequate or abnormal patterns of insulin release. Also, beta cells may be damaged by high blood glucose itself, a condition called glucose toxicity.\n                \nScientists have not determined the causes of beta cell dysfunction in most cases. Single gene defects lead to specific forms of diabetes called maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY). The genes involved regulate insulin production in the beta cells. Although these forms of diabetes are rare, they provide clues as to how beta cell function may be affected by key regulatory factors. Other gene variants are involved in determining the number and function of beta cells. But these variants account for only a small percentage of type 2 diabetes cases. Malnutrition early in life is also being investigated as a cause of beta cell dysfunction. The metabolic environment of the developing fetus may also create a predisposition for diabetes later in life.\n                \nRisk Factors for Type 2 Diabetes\n                \nPeople who develop type 2 diabetes are more likely to have the following characteristics:\n                \n- age 45 or older  - overweight or obese  - physically inactive  - parent or sibling with diabetes  - family background that is African American, Alaska Native, American Indian, Asian American, Hispanic/Latino, or Pacific Islander American  - history of giving birth to a baby weighing more than 9 pounds  - history of gestational diabetes  - high blood pressure140/90 or aboveor being treated for high blood pressure  - high-density lipoprotein (HDL), or good, cholesterol below 35 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL), or a triglyceride level above 250 mg/dL  - polycystic ovary syndrome, also called PCOS  - prediabetesan A1C level of 5.7 to 6.4 percent; a fasting plasma glucose test result of 100125 mg/dL, called impaired fasting glucose; or a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test result of 140199, called impaired glucose tolerance  - acanthosis nigricans, a condition associated with insulin resistance, characterized by a dark, velvety rash around the neck or armpits  - history of CVD\n                \nThe American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends that testing to detect prediabetes and type 2 diabetes be considered in adults who are overweight or obese and have one or more additional risk factors for diabetes. In adults without these risk factors, testing should begin at age 45.",

Type 2 Diabetes: This occurs when the body becomes resistant to insulin or doesn't produce enough insulin to maintain normal glucose levels. Risk factors include obesity, physical inactivity, family history, and older age.\n\nIn both cases, diabetes results in high levels of glucose in the blood, which can lead to a number of serious health complications if not managed properly.",
        "original_answer": "Insulin Resistance and Beta Cell Dysfunction\n                \nHormones produced by the placenta and other pregnancy-related factors contribute to insulin resistance, which occurs in all women during late pregnancy. Insulin resistance increases the amount of insulin needed to control blood glucose levels. If the pancreas cant produce enough insulin due to beta cell dysfunction, gestational diabetes occurs.\n                \nAs with type 2 diabetes, excess weight is linked to gestational diabetes. Overweight or obese women are at particularly high risk for gestational diabetes because they start pregnancy with a higher need for insulin due to insulin resistance. Excessive weight gain during pregnancy may also increase risk.\n                \nFamily History\n                \nHaving a family history of diabetes is also a risk factor for gestational diabetes, suggesting that genes play a role in its development. Genetics may also explain why the disorder occurs more frequently in African Americans, American Indians, and Hispanics/Latinos. Many gene variants or combinations of variants may increase a womans risk for developing gestational diabetes. Studies have found several gene variants associated with gestational diabetes, but these variants account for only a small fraction of women with gestational diabetes.\n                \nFuture Risk of Type 2 Diabetes\n                \nBecause a womans hormones usually return to normal levels soon after giving birth, gestational diabetes disappears in most women after delivery. However, women who have gestational diabetes are more likely to develop gestational diabetes with future pregnancies and develop type 2 diabetes.3 Women with gestational diabetes should be tested for persistent diabetes 6 to 12 weeks after delivery and at least every 3 years thereafter.\n                \nAlso, exposure to high glucose levels during gestation increases a childs risk for becoming overweight or obese and for developing type 2 diabetes later on. The result may be a cycle of diabetes affecting multiple generations in a family. For both mother and child, maintaining a healthy body weight and being physically active may help prevent type 2 diabetes.",

        "original_answer": "Other types of diabetes have a variety of possible causes.\n                \nGenetic Mutations Affecting Beta Cells, Insulin, and Insulin Action\n                \nSome relatively uncommon forms of diabetes known as monogenic diabetes are caused by mutations, or changes, in a single gene. These mutations are usually inherited, but sometimes the gene mutation occurs spontaneously. Most of these gene mutations cause diabetes by reducing beta cells ability to produce insulin.\n                \nThe most common types of monogenic diabetes are neonatal diabetes mellitus (NDM) and MODY. NDM occurs in the first 6 months of life. MODY is usually found during adolescence or early adulthood but sometimes is not diagnosed until later in life. More information about NDM and MODY is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Monogenic Forms of Diabetes.\n                \nOther rare genetic mutations can cause diabetes by damaging the quality of insulin the body produces or by causing abnormalities in insulin receptors.\n                \nOther Genetic Diseases\n                \nDiabetes occurs in people with Down syndrome, Klinefelter syndrome, and Turner syndrome at higher rates than the general population. Scientists are investigating whether genes that may predispose people to genetic syndromes also predispose them to diabetes.\n                \nThe genetic disorders cystic fibrosis and hemochromatosis are linked to diabetes. Cystic fibrosis produces abnormally thick mucus, which blocks the pancreas. The risk of diabetes increases with age in people with cystic fibrosis. Hemochromatosis causes the body to store too much iron. If the disorder is not treated, iron can build up in and damage the pancreas and other organs.\n                \nDamage to or Removal of the Pancreas\n                \nPancreatitis, cancer, and trauma can all harm the pancreatic beta cells or impair insulin production, thus causing diabetes. If the damaged pancreas is removed, diabetes will occur due to the loss of the beta cells.\n                \nEndocrine Diseases\n                \nEndocrine diseases affect organs that produce hormones. Cushings syndrome and acromegaly are examples of hormonal disorders that can cause prediabetes and diabetes by inducing insulin resistance. Cushings syndrome is marked by excessive production of cortisolsometimes called the stress hormone. Acromegaly occurs when the body produces too much growth hormone. Glucagonoma, a rare tumor of the pancreas, can also cause diabetes. The tumor causes the body to produce too much glucagon. Hyperthyroidism, a disorder that occurs when the thyroid gland produces too much thyroid hormone, can also cause elevated blood glucose levels.\n                \nAutoimmune Disorders\n                \nRare disorders characterized by antibodies that disrupt insulin action can lead to diabetes. This kind of diabetes is often associated with other autoimmune disorders such as lupus erythematosus. Another rare autoimmune disorder called stiff-man syndrome is associated with antibodies that attack the beta cells, similar to type 1 diabetes.\n                \nMedications and Chemical Toxins\n                \nSome medications, such as nicotinic acid and certain types of diuretics, anti-seizure drugs, psychiatric drugs, and drugs to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), can impair beta cells or disrupt insulin action. Pentamidine, a drug prescribed to treat a type of pneumonia, can increase the risk of pancreatitis, beta cell damage, and diabetes. Also, glucocorticoidssteroid hormones that are chemically similar to naturally produced cortisolmay impair insulin action. Glucocorticoids are used to treat inflammatory illnesses such as rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, lupus, and ulcerative colitis.\n                \nMany chemical toxins can damage or destroy beta cells in animals, but only a few have been linked to diabetes in humans. For example, dioxina contaminant of the herbicide Agent Orange, used during the Vietnam Warmay be linked to the development of type 2 diabetes. In 2000, based on a report from the Institute of Medicine, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) added diabetes to the list of conditions for which Vietnam veterans are eligible for disability compensation. Also, a chemical in a rat poison no longer in use has been shown to cause diabetes if ingested. Some studies suggest a high intake of nitrogen-containing chemicals such as nitrates and nitrites might increase the risk of diabetes. Arsenic has also been studied for possible links to diabetes.\n                \nLipodystrophy\n                \nLipodystrophy is a condition in which fat tissue is lost or redistributed in the body. The condition is associated with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.",

        "original_answer": "- Diabetes is a complex group of diseases with a variety of causes. Scientists believe genes and environmental factors interact to cause diabetes in most cases.  - People with diabetes have high blood glucose, also called high blood sugar or hyperglycemia. Diabetes develops when the body doesnt make enough insulin or is not able to use insulin effectively, or both.  - Insulin is a hormone made by beta cells in the pancreas. Insulin helps cells throughout the body absorb and use glucose for energy. If the body does not produce enough insulin or cannot use insulin effectively, glucose builds up in the blood instead of being absorbed by cells in the body, and the body is starved of energy.  - Prediabetes is a condition in which blood glucose levels or A1C levels are higher than normal but not high enough to be diagnosed as diabetes. People with prediabetes can substantially reduce their risk of developing diabetes by losing weight and increasing physical activity.  - The two main types of diabetes are type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. Gestational diabetes is a third form of diabetes that develops only during pregnancy.  - Type 1 diabetes is caused by a lack of insulin due to the destruction of insulin-producing beta cells. In type 1 diabetesan autoimmune diseasethe bodys immune system attacks and destroys the beta cells.  - Type 2 diabetesthe most common form of diabetesis caused by a combination of factors, including insulin resistance, a condition in which the bodys muscle, fat, and liver cells do not use insulin effectively.

Here are the three main treatment options:\n\n1. Dialysis: This is a process that removes waste and excess fluid from the blood when the kidneys can no longer do so. There are two main types: hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis.\n\n2. Kidney transplant: This involves surgically implanting a healthy kidney from a donor into the patient's body.

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Living with kidney failure, also known as end-stage renal disease (ESRD), requires significant lifestyle changes and close medical management. Here are the three main treatment options:\n\n1. Dialysis: This is a process that removes waste and excess fluid from the blood when the kidneys can no longer do so. There are two main types: hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis.\n\n2. Kidney transplant: This involves surgically implanting a healthy kidney from a donor into the patient's body. After a successful transplant, the patient will need to take immunosuppressive drugs for the rest of their life to prevent rejection of the new kidney.\n\n3. Conservative management: This is an option for some patients who are not good candidates for dialysis or transplant, or who choose not to have these treatments. It involves a combination of medications, diet and fluid management, and other treatments to manage symptoms and slow the progression of the disease.\n\nRegardless of the treatment chosen, patients with kidney failure will need to make lifelong changes to their diet and fluid intake, and will need to be closely monitored by a healthcare team. It's important for patients to work closely with their doctors to develop a personalized treatment plan that meets their individual needs and goals.",
        "original_answer": "Learning about different treatments for kidney failure will help you choose the one that best fits your lifestyle. Talk with your doctor and people on hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis to learn about the pros and cons of each treatment. Ask your doctor about the transplant waiting list and about medicines required after a transplant. Talk with people who have had kidney transplants and ask how it has changed their lives.\n                \nIf you plan to keep working, think about which treatment can help make that easier. If spending time with family and friends means a lot to you, learn about which treatment may give you the most free time. Find out which treatment will give you the best chance to be healthy and live longer.\n                \nTalking with your doctor ahead of time about your options can help you take control of your care. Understanding the treatment you choose and getting used to the idea that you will be receiving this treatment takes time. If you choose one type of dialysis treatment and find it is not a good fit for your life, talk with your doctor about selecting another type of dialysis treatment that better meets your needs.\n                \nWhile kidney failure can make your life harder, treatments can help improve your life.",

        "original_answer": "Eating the right foods can help you feel better when you are on dialysis or have a kidney transplant. Staying healthy with kidney failure requires watching how much of these elements are included in your diet:\n                \n- Protein is in many foods you eat. Protein is in foods from animals and plants. Most diets include both types of protein. Protein provides the building blocks that maintain and repair muscles, organs, and other parts of the body. Too much protein can cause waste to build up in your blood, making your kidneys work harder. However, if you are on hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis, you need lots of protein to replace the protein that dialysis removes.  - Phosphorus is a mineral that keeps your bones healthy. Phosphorus also keeps blood vessels and muscles working. This mineral is found naturally in foods rich in protein, such as meat, poultry, fish, nuts, beans, and dairy products. Phosphorus is also added to many processed foods. You need phosphorus to turn food into energy; however, too much can cause your bones to weaken.  - Water is in drinks and in foods such as fruits, vegetables, ice cream, gelatin, soup, and popsicles. Your body needs water; however, too much can cause fluid to build up in your body and make your heart work harder.  - Sodium is a part of salt. You can find sodium in many canned, packaged, and fast foods and in seasonings and meats. You need sodium to help control the amount of fluid in your body; however, too much can cause high blood pressure.  - Potassium is a mineral that helps your nerves and muscles work the right way. Potassium is found in fruits and vegetables such as oranges, bananas, tomatoes, and potatoes. You need potassium for healthy nerves and brain cells; however, too much can make your heartbeat irregular.  - Calories are found in all foods and are especially high in oils and sugary foods. You need calories for energy; however, too many can cause weight gain and high blood sugar.\n                \nTalk with your clinics renal dietitian to find a meal plan that works for you. Each treatment requires a different diet. If you are on hemodialysis, you have to stay away from foods such as potatoes and oranges because they have lots of potassium. If you are on peritoneal dialysis, eating potassium is fine. Instead, you may need to watch your calories. Your food needs will also depend on your weight and activity level.\n                \nChanging your diet may be hard at first. Eating the right foods will help you feel better. You will have more strength and energy. Having more energy will help you live a fuller, healthier life.

        "original_answer": "You already know you need to watch how much you drink. Any food that is liquid at room temperature also contains water. These foods include soup, Jell-O, and ice cream. Many fruits and vegetables contain lots of water, too. They include melons, grapes, apples, oranges, tomatoes, lettuce, and celery. All these foods add to your fluid intake.\n                \nFluid can build up between dialysis sessions, causing swelling and weight gain. The extra fluid affects your blood pressure and can make your heart work harder. You could have serious heart trouble from overloading your system with fluid.\n                \nControl Your Thirst   The best way to reduce fluid intake is to reduce thirst caused by the salt you eat. Avoid salty foods like chips and pretzels. Choose low-sodium products.   You can keep your fluids down by drinking from smaller cups or glasses. Freeze juice in an ice cube tray and eat it like a popsicle. (Remember to count the popsicle in your fluid allowance!) The dietitian will be able to give you other tips for managing your thirst.\n                \nYour dry weight is your weight after a dialysis session when all of the extra fluid in your body has been removed. If you let too much fluid build up between sessions, it is harder to get down to your proper dry weight. Your dry weight may change over a period of 3 to 6 weeks. Talk with your doctor regularly about what your dry weight should be.\n                \nMy dry weight should be _____________.\n                \nTalk With a Dietitian   Even though you are on hemodialysis, your kidneys may still be able to remove some fluid. Or your kidneys may not remove any fluid at all. That is why every patient has a different daily allowance for fluid. Talk with your dietitian about how much fluid you can have each day.   I can have _____ ounces of fluid each day.   Plan 1 day of fluid servings:   I can have _____ ounce(s) of ______________ with breakfast.

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Managing chronic kidney disease (CKD) in children can be challenging, but with the right approach, it's possible to help them lead a healthy and fulfilling life. Here are some steps to take:\n\n1. Follow the treatment plan: It's essential to follow the treatment plan prescribed by your child's healthcare provider, which may include medication, dietary restrictions, and fluid intake limits.\n2. Encourage a healthy lifestyle: Encourage your child to engage in regular physical activity, get enough rest, and avoid smoking and alcohol.\n3. Monitor blood pressure: High blood pressure is a common complication of CKD, so it's crucial to monitor your child's blood pressure regularly.\n4. Manage anemia: Anemia is also common in children with CKD, so it's essential to manage it with the right medication and diet.\n5. Monitor growth and development: Children with CKD may experience growth and development delays, so it's crucial to monitor their progress regularly.\n6. Provide emotional support: Living with CKD can be challenging for children, so it's essential to provide emotional support and encourage open communication.\n7. Stay informed: Stay informed about the latest research and treatment options for CKD in children, and consider joining a support group to connect with other families facing similar challenges.\n\nRemember, managing CKD in children is a team effort, so work closely with your child's healthcare provider to develop a comprehensive care plan.",
        "original_answer": "For children with CKD, learning about nutrition is vital because their diet can affect how well their kidneys work. Parents or guardians should always consult with their childs health care team before making any dietary changes. Staying healthy with CKD requires paying close attention to the following elements of a diet:\n                \n- Protein. Children with CKD should eat enough protein for growth while limiting high protein intake. Too much protein can put an extra burden on the kidneys and cause kidney function to decline faster. Protein needs increase when a child is on dialysis because the dialysis process removes protein from the childs blood. The health care team recommends the amount of protein needed for the child. Foods with protein include      - eggs    - milk    - cheese    - chicken    - fish    - red meats    - beans    - yogurt    - cottage cheese    - Sodium. The amount of sodium children need depends on the stage of their kidney disease, their age, and sometimes other factors. The health care team may recommend limiting or adding sodium and salt to the diet. Foods high in sodium include      - canned foods    - some frozen foods    - most processed foods    - some snack foods, such as chips and crackers    - Potassium. Potassium levels need to stay in the normal range for children with CKD, because too little or too much potassium can cause heart and muscle problems. Children may need to stay away from some fruits and vegetables or reduce the number of servings and portion sizes to make sure they do not take in too much potassium. The health care team recommends the amount of potassium a child needs. Low-potassium fruits and vegetables include      - apples    - cranberries    - strawberries    - blueberries    - raspberries    - pineapple    - cabbage    - boiled cauliflower    - mustard greens    - uncooked broccoli   High-potassium fruits and vegetables include      - oranges    - melons    - apricots    - bananas    - potatoes    - tomatoes    - sweet potatoes    - cooked spinach    - cooked broccoli    - Phosphorus. Children with CKD need to control the level of phosphorus in their blood because too much phosphorus pulls calcium from the bones, making them weaker and more likely to break. Too much phosphorus also can cause itchy skin and red eyes. As CKD progresses, a child may need to take a phosphate binder with meals to lower the concentration of phosphorus in the blood. Phosphorus is found in high-protein foods. Foods with low levels of phosphorus include      - liquid nondairy creamer    - green beans    - popcorn    - unprocessed meats from a butcher    - lemon-lime soda    - root beer    - powdered iced tea and lemonade mixes    - rice and corn cereals    - egg whites    - sorbet    - Fluids. Early in CKD, a childs damaged kidneys may produce either too much or too little urine, which can lead to swelling or dehydration. As CKD progresses, children may need to limit fluid intake. The health care provider will tell the child and parents or guardians the goal for fluid intake.\n                \nMore information is provided in the NIDDK health topics, Nutrition for Chronic Kidney Disease in Children and Kidney Failure: Eat Right to Feel Right on Hemodialysis.",

        "original_answer": "- Children with chronic kidney disease (CKD) may have a negative self-image and may have relationship problems with family members due to the stress of living with a chronic disease. The condition can lead to behavior problems and make participating in school and extracurricular activities more difficult.  - CKD can cause learning problems because the buildup of wastes in the body can slow down nerve and brain function. Children with CKD may have trouble concentrating and may develop language and motor skills more slowly than their peers.  - Parents and other adults can help children with CKD fit in at school, deal with low self-esteem, make friends, be physically active, and follow their treatment regimen. As children with CKD approach adulthood, they may need help with preparing to enter the workforce.  - School attendance is vital in helping children with CKD lead the best life possible.  - One way to help children feel empowered is to give them as much control and responsibility over their own care as possible:      - Children can learn more about their medications, including doses.    - Children on dialysis should be encouraged to take an active part in their treatments.    - Parents or guardians should allow children to participate in treatment decision making.    - Participating in regular classroom and extracurricular activities may help children improve their social skills. Summer camps and recreational programs for children with special needs can be a good place to make new friends.  - Parents or guardians may feel protective of children with CKD; however, they should not try to limit activities unless instructed to by a health care provider.   - Children with CKD may need to take multiple medications, eat a specific diet, and follow their health care providers orders to help control their disease. Many children have a hard time following the treatment regimen. Health care providers use the term nonadherence to describe the failure or refusal to take prescribed medications or follow a health care providers directions.  - Adherence can be improved with a combination of health education, motivational techniques, and behavioral skill methods.  - Many skilled professionals are available to ensure that children with CKD get the best possible care. The family may want to talk with a social worker, mental health professional, financial counselor, and dietitian. If a child reaches kidney failure, the medical staff at the dialysis center or transplantation clinic can provide help.  - For children with CKD, learning about nutrition is vital because their diet can affect how well their kidneys work. Parents or guardians should always consult with their childs health care team before making any dietary changes.",

Symptoms: Many people with Hepatitis B do not have symptoms, but those who do may experience fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes), and dark urine.\n\n3. Prevention: The best way to prevent Hepatitis B is by getting vaccinated. The vaccine is usually given in a series of three shots.\n\n4. Treatment: There is no cure for Hepatitis B, but treatments can help manage the symptoms and reduce the risk of complications. These may include antiviral medications and regular monitoring of liver function.\n\n5. Chronic Infection: About 5-10% of adults who get Hepatitis B develop a chronic (long-term) infection. This risk is higher for infants and children. Chronic Hepatitis B can lead to serious health problems, including liver damage, liver cancer, and death.\n\n6. Testing: If you think you have been exposed to Hepatitis B, or if you have symptoms, you should get tested. There are two main blood tests for Hepatitis B: one that checks for the virus itself, and another that checks for antibodies to the virus, which indicate a past or current infection.\n\nRemember, if you have any concerns about Hepatitis B, you should speak with a healthcare professional.",
        "original_answer": "Chronic hepatitis B is a long-lasting infection with the hepatitis B virus. Chronic hepatitis B occurs when the body cant get rid of the hepatitis B virus. Children, especially infants, are more likely to get chronic hepatitis B, which usually has no symptoms until signs of liver damage appear.\n                \nWithout treatment, chronic hepatitis B can cause liver cancer or severe liver damage that leads to liver failure. Liver failure occurs when the liver stops working properly.",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Hepatitis B is a viral infection that affects the liver. To diagnose Hepatitis B, a healthcare provider will typically:\n\n1. Take a medical history: This includes asking about symptoms, risk factors, and sexual history.\n2. Perform a physical exam: The provider may check for signs of liver disease, such as a swollen abdomen or yellowing of the skin and eyes (jaundice).\n3. Order laboratory tests: These may include:\n\t* Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg): This test detects the presence of the virus in the blood, indicating an active infection.\n\t* Antibodies to the Hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc): These antibodies indicate that a person has been infected with Hepatitis B at some point in the past.\n\t* Hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg): This test indicates whether the virus is actively replicating and whether the infection is likely to be contagious.\n\t* Hepatitis B virus DNA (HBV DNA): This test measures the amount of virus in the blood and can help determine the severity of the infection.\n\t* Liver function tests (LFTs): These tests measure the levels of certain enzymes and proteins in the blood that are produced by the liver. Elevated levels can indicate liver damage or inflammation.\n\nIf you suspect you have been exposed to Hepatitis B, it is important to seek medical attention promptly. Early diagnosis and treatment can help prevent complications and improve outcomes.",
        "original_answer": "A blood test will show if you have hepatitis B. Blood tests are done at a doctors office or outpatient facility. A blood sample is taken using a needle inserted into a vein in your arm or hand. The blood sample is sent to a lab to test for hepatitis B.\n                \nIf you are at higher risk of getting hepatitis B, get tested. If you are pregnant, you should also get tested. Many people with hepatitis B do not know they are infected. Early diagnosis and treatment can help prevent liver damage.\n                \nYour doctor may suggest getting a liver biopsy if chronic hepatitis B is suspected. A liver biopsy is a test to take a small piece of your liver to look for liver damage. The doctor may ask you to stop taking certain medicines before the test. You may be asked to fast for 8 hours before the test.\n                \nDuring the test, you lie on a table with your right hand resting above your head. Medicine is applied to numb the area where the biopsy needle will be inserted. If needed, sedatives and pain medicine are also given. The doctor uses a needle to take a small piece of liver tissue. After the test, you must lie on your right side for up to 2 hours. You will stay 2 to 4 hours after the test before being sent home.\n                \nA liver biopsy is performed at a hospital or outpatient center by a doctor. The liver tissue is sent to a special lab where a doctor looks at the tissue with a microscope and sends a report to your doctor.",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Hepatitis B is a liver infection caused by the Hepatitis B virus (HBV). The goal of treatment is to suppress the virus and prevent it from causing liver damage.\n\nThere are several treatment options available for Hepatitis B:\n\n1. Antiviral medications: These drugs can help to slow down or stop the virus from replicating, reducing the risk of liver damage. Examples include tenofovir, entecavir, and lamivudine.\n2. Interferon: This is a type of medication that can boost the body's immune system and help it to fight off the virus. However, it can have significant side effects and is usually only used in severe cases.\n3. Liver transplant: In rare cases, where the liver has been severely damaged, a liver transplant may be necessary.\n\nIt is important to note that not everyone with Hepatitis B will require treatment, as some people may be able to fight off the virus on their own. Your doctor will be able to determine the best course of treatment based on your individual circumstances.\n\nAdditionally, there are lifestyle changes you can make to help manage Hepatitis B, such as avoiding alcohol, eating a healthy diet, getting regular exercise, and getting vaccinated against Hepatitis A to prevent further liver damage.\n\nIt is important to work closely with your doctor to develop a treatment plan that is right for you.",

It is important to note that the severity of the condition can vary widely among individuals, even within the same family.",
        "original_answer": "Alagille syndrome is caused by a gene mutation, or defect. Genes provide instructions for making proteins in the body. A gene mutation is a permanent change in the DNA sequence that makes up a gene. DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is the material inside cells that carries genetic information and passes genes from parent to child. Approximately 30 to 50 percent of people with Alagille syndrome have an inherited gene mutation, meaning it has been passed on by a parent. In the remaining cases, the gene mutation develops spontaneously.1 In spontaneous cases, neither parent carries a copy of the mutated gene.\n                \nMost cases of Alagille syndrome are caused by a mutation in the JAGGED1 (JAG1) gene. In less than 1 percent of cases, a mutation in the NOTCH2 gene is the cause.2\n                \n\n                \nGenetic Disorders   Each cell contains thousands of genes that provide the instructions for making proteins for growth and repair of the body. If a gene has a mutation, the protein made by that gene may not function properly, which sometimes creates a genetic disorder. Not all gene mutations cause a disorder.   People have two copies of most genes; one copy is inherited from each parent. A genetic disorder occurs when one or both parents pass a mutated gene to a child at conception. A genetic disorder can also occur through a spontaneous gene mutation, meaning neither parent carries a copy of the mutated gene. Once a spontaneous gene mutation has occurred in a person, it can be passed to the person's children.

Liver problems: This can include a lack of bile ducts in the liver (biliary atresia), leading to jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes), liver scarring (cirrhosis), and liver failure.\n\n2. Heart conditions: This can include structural heart defects, such as pulmonary artery stenosis (narrowing of the blood vessel that carries blood from the heart to the lungs).\n\n3. Eye abnormalities: This can include a characteristic \"keyhole\" shape to the iris (the colored part of the eye).\n\n4. Skeletal abnormalities: This can include a butterfly-like shape to the spine (spinal dysplasia), and abnormalities in the ribs and thigh bones.\n\n5.

        "original_answer": "The signs and symptoms of Alagille syndrome and their severity vary, even among people in the same family sharing the same gene mutation.\n                \nLiver\n                \nIn some people, problems in the liver may be the first signs and symptoms of the disorder. These signs and symptoms can occur in children and adults with Alagille syndrome, and in infants as early as the first 3 months of life.\n                \nJaundice. Jaundicewhen the skin and whites of the eyes turn yellowis a result of the liver not removing bilirubin from the blood. Bilirubin is a reddish-yellow substance formed when hemoglobin breaks down. Hemoglobin is an iron-rich protein that gives blood its red color. Bilirubin is absorbed by the liver, processed, and released into bile. Blockage of the bile ducts forces bilirubin and other elements of bile to build up in the blood.\n                \nJaundice may be difficult for parents and even health care providers to detect. Many healthy newborns have mild jaundice during the first 1 to 2 weeks of life due to an immature liver. This normal type of jaundice disappears by the second or third week of life, whereas the jaundice of Alagille syndrome deepens. Newborns with jaundice after 2 weeks of life should be seen by a health care provider to check for a possible liver problem.\n                \nDark urine and gray or white stools. High levels of bilirubin in the blood that pass into the urine can make the urine darker, while stool lightens from a lack of bilirubin reaching the intestines. Gray or white bowel movements after 2 weeks of age are a reliable sign of a liver problem and should prompt a visit to a health care provider.\n                \nPruritus. The buildup of bilirubin in the blood may cause itching, also called pruritus. Pruritus usually starts after 3 months of age and can be severe.\n                \nXanthomas. Xanthomas are fatty deposits that appear as yellow bumps on the skin. They are caused by abnormally high cholesterol levels in the blood, common in people with liver disease. Xanthomas may appear anywhere on the body. However, xanthomas are usually found on the elbows, joints, tendons, knees, hands, feet, or buttocks.\n                \nOther Signs and Symptoms of Alagille Syndrome\n                \nCertain signs of Alagille syndrome are unique to the disorder, including those that affect the vertebrae and facial features.\n                \nFace. Many children with Alagille syndrome have deep-set eyes, a straight nose, a small and pointed chin, large ears, and a prominent, wide forehead. These features are not usually recognized until after infancy. By adulthood, the chin is more prominent.\n                \nEyes. Posterior embryotoxon is a condition in which an opaque ring is present in the cornea, the transparent covering of the eyeball. The abnormality is common in people with Alagille syndrome, though it usually does not affect vision.\n                \nSkeleton. The most common skeletal defect in a person with Alagille syndrome is when the shape of the vertebraebones of the spinegives the appearance of flying butterflies. This defect, known as \"butterfly\" vertebrae, rarely causes medical problems or requires treatment.\n                \nHeart and blood vessels. People with Alagille syndrome may have the following signs and symptoms having to do with the heart and blood vessels:\n                \n- heart murmuran extra or unusual sound heard during a heartbeat. A heart murmur is the most common sign of Alagille syndrome other than the general symptoms of liver disease.1 Most people with Alagille syndrome have a narrowing of the blood vessels that carry blood from the heart to the lungs.1 This narrowing causes a murmur that can be heard with a stethoscope. Heart murmurs usually do not cause problems.  - heart walls and valve problems. A small number of people with Alagille syndrome have serious problems with the walls or valves of the heart. These conditions may need treatment with medications or corrective surgery.  - blood vessel problems. People with Alagille syndrome may have abnormalities of the blood vessels in the head and neck. This serious complication can lead to internal bleeding or stroke. Alagille syndrome can also cause narrowing or bulging of other blood vessels in the body.\n                \nKidney disease. A wide range of kidney diseases can occur in Alagille syndrome. The kidneys are two bean-shaped organs, each about the size of a fist, that filter wastes and extra fluid from the blood. Some people have small kidneys or have cystsfluid-filled sacsin the kidneys. Kidney function can also decrease.",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Alagille Syndrome is a genetic disorder that can affect multiple body systems, including the liver, heart, and digestive system. Some potential complications of this condition include:\n\n* Liver problems: Many people with Alagille Syndrome have liver damage or bile duct blockages, which can lead to scarring of the liver (cirrhosis) and liver failure.\n* Heart problems: Alagille Syndrome can also affect the heart, causing narrowing of the aortic valve (valve that regulates blood flow from the heart to the rest of the body) or other heart defects.\n* Digestive problems: Alagille Syndrome can cause problems with the digestive system, such as poor absorption of nutrients (malabsorption), leading to vitamin deficiencies and difficulty gaining weight.\n* Growth problems: Children with Alagille Syndrome may be smaller than average and may have delays in reaching developmental milestones.\n* Kidney problems: Some people with Alagille Syndrome have kidney problems, such as kidney cysts or kidney stones.\n* Bone problems: Alagille Syndrome can also affect the bones, causing them to be thin and brittle (osteoporosis) or leading to fractures.\n\nIt is important to note that not all people with Alagille Syndrome will experience all of these complications, and the severity of the condition can vary widely from person to person. If you or your child has been diagnosed with Alagille Syndrome, it is important to work with a healthcare team to manage the condition and address any complications as they arise.",
        "original_answer": "The complications of Alagille syndrome include liver failure, portal hypertension, and growth problems. People with Alagille syndrome usually have a combination of complications, and may not have every complication listed below.\n                \nLiver failure. Over time, the decreased number of bile ducts may lead to chronic liver failure, also called end-stage liver disease. This condition progresses over months, years, or even decades. The liver can no longer perform important functions or effectively replace damaged cells. A person may need a liver transplant. A liver transplant is surgery to remove a diseased or an injured liver and replace it with a healthy whole liver or a segment of a liver from another person, called a donor.\n                \nPortal hypertension. The spleen is the organ that cleans blood and makes white blood cells. White blood cells attack bacteria and other foreign cells. Blood flow from the spleen drains directly into the liver. When a person with Alagille syndrome has advanced liver disease, the blood flow backs up into the spleen and other blood vessels. This condition is called portal hypertension. The spleen may become larger in the later stages of liver disease. A person with an enlarged spleen should avoid contact sports to protect the organ from injury. Advanced portal hypertension can lead to serious bleeding problems.\n                \nGrowth problems. Alagille syndrome can lead to poor growth in infants and children, as well as delayed puberty in older children. Liver disease can cause malabsorption, which can result in growth problems. Malabsorption is the inability of the small intestine to absorb nutrients from foods, which results in protein, calorie, and vitamin deficiencies. Serious heart problems, if present in Alagille syndrome, can also affect growth.\n                \nMalabsorption. People with Alagille syndrome may have diarrhealoose, watery stoolsdue to malabsorption. The condition occurs because bile is necessary for the digestion of food. Malabsorption can lead to bone fractures, eye problems, blood-clotting problems, and learning delays.\n                \nLong-term Outlook\n                \nThe long-term outlook for people with Alagille syndrome depends on several factors, including the severity of liver damage and heart problems. Predicting who will experience improved bile flow and who will progress to chronic liver failure is difficult. Ten to 30 percent of people with Alagille syndrome will eventually need a liver transplant.3\n                \nMany adults with Alagille syndrome whose symptoms improve with treatment lead normal, productive lives. Deaths in people with Alagille syndrome are most often caused by chronic liver failure, heart problems, and blood vessel problems.",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Alagille Syndrome is typically diagnosed through a combination of clinical features and genetic testing. The most common clinical features include:\n\n1. Cholestatic liver disease (persistent jaundice, pale stools, and dark urine)\n2. Heart defects\n3. Skeletal abnormalities\n4. Eye abnormalities\n5. Characteristic facial features\n\nIf a patient presents with these features, genetic testing can be done to look for mutations in the Jagged1 (JAG1) or NOTCH2 genes, which are associated with Alagille Syndrome. A diagnosis can be confirmed if a mutation is found in one of these genes. It is important to note that not all individuals with Alagille Syndrome will have mutations in these genes, and some individuals with mutations may not have symptoms of the disease. Therefore, a comprehensive evaluation by a specialist is necessary to make an accurate diagnosis.",
        "original_answer": "A health care provider diagnoses Alagille syndrome by performing a thorough physical exam and ordering one or more of the following tests and exams:\n                \n- blood test  - urinalysis  - x ray  - abdominal ultrasound  - cardiology exam  - slit-lamp exam  - liver biopsy  - genetic testing\n                \nAlagille syndrome can be difficult to diagnose because the signs and symptoms vary and the syndrome is so rare.\n                \nFor a diagnosis of Alagille syndrome, three of the following symptoms typically should be present:\n                \n- liver symptoms, such as jaundice, pruritus, malabsorption, and xanthomas  - heart abnormalities or murmurs  - skeletal abnormalities  - posterior embryotoxon  - facial features typical of Alagille syndrome  - kidney disease  - blood vessel problems\n                \nA health care provider may perform a liver biopsy to diagnose Alagille syndrome; however, it is not necessary to make a diagnosis. A diagnosis can be made in a person who does not meet the clinical criteria of Alagille syndrome yet does have a gene mutation of JAG1. The health care provider may have a blood sample tested to look for the JAG1 gene mutation. The gene mutation can be identified in 94 percent of people with a diagnosis of Alagille syndrome.2\n                \nBlood test. A blood test involves drawing blood at a health care provider's office or a commercial facility and sending the sample to a lab for analysis. The blood test can show nutritional status and the presence of liver disease and kidney function.\n                \nUrinalysis. Urinalysis is the testing of a urine sample. The urine sample is collected in a special container in a health care provider's office or a commercial facility and can be tested in the same location or sent to a lab for analysis. Urinalysis can show many problems of the urinary tract and other body systems. The sample may be observed for color, cloudiness, or concentration; signs of drug use; chemical composition, including glucose; the presence of protein, blood cells, or bacteria; or other signs of disease.\n                \nX ray. An x ray is a picture created by using radiation and recorded on film or on a computer. The amount of radiation used is small. An x-ray technician performs the x ray at a hospital or an outpatient center, and a radiologista doctor who specializes in medical imaginginterprets the images. Anesthesia is not needed. The patient will lie on a table or stand during the x ray. The technician positions the x-ray machine over the spine area to look for \"butterfly\" vertebrae. The patient will hold his or her breath as the picture is taken so that the picture will not be blurry. The patient may be asked to change position for additional pictures.\n                \nAbdominal ultrasound. Ultrasound uses a device, called a transducer, that bounces safe, painless sound waves off organs to create an image of their structure. The transducer can be moved to different angles to make it possible to examine different organs. In abdominal ultrasound, the health care provider applies a gel to the patient's abdomen and moves a handheld transducer over the skin. The gel allows the transducer to glide easily, and it improves the transmission of the signals. A specially trained technician performs the procedure in a health care provider's office, an outpatient center, or a hospital, and a radiologist interprets the images; anesthesia is not needed. The images can show an enlarged liver or rule out other conditions.\n                \nCardiology exam. A cardiologista doctor who treats people who have heart problemsperforms a cardiology exam in a health care provider's office, an outpatient center, or a hospital. During a full exam, a cardiologist may inspect the patient's physical appearance, measure pulse rate and blood pressure, observe the jugular vein, check for rapid or skipped heartbeats, listen for variations in heart sounds, and listen to the lungs.\n                \nSlit-lamp exam. An ophthalmologista doctor who diagnoses and treats all eye diseases and eye disordersperforms a slit-lamp exam to diagnose posterior embryotoxon. The ophthalmologist examines the eye with a slit lamp, a microscope combined with a high-intensity light that shines a thin beam on the eye. While sitting in a chair, the patient will rest his or her head on the slit lamp. A yellow dye may be used to examine the cornea and tear layer. The dye is applied as a drop, or the specialist may touch a strip of paper stained with the dye to the white of the patient's eye. The specialist will also use drops in the patient's eye to dilate the pupil.\n                \nLiver biopsy. A liver biopsy is a procedure that involves taking a piece of liver tissue for examination with a microscope for signs of damage or disease. The health care provider may ask the patient to stop taking certain medications temporarily before the liver biopsy. The patient may be asked to fast for 8 hours before the procedure.\n                \nDuring the procedure, the patient lies on a table, right hand resting above the head. A local anesthetic is applied to the area where the biopsy needle will be inserted. If needed, sedatives and pain medication are also given. The health care provider uses a needle to take a small piece of liver tissue. The health care provider may use ultrasound, computerized tomography scans, or other imaging techniques to guide the needle. After the biopsy, the patient should lie on the right side for up to 2 hours and is monitored an additional 2 to 4 hours before being sent home.\n                \nGenetic testing. The health care provider may refer a person suspected of having Alagille syndrome to a geneticista doctor who specializes in genetic disorders. For a genetic test, the geneticist takes a blood or saliva sample and analyzes the DNA for the JAG1 gene mutation. The geneticist tests for the JAG1 gene mutation first, since it is more common in Alagille syndrome than NOTCH2. Genetic testing is often done only by specialized labs. The results may not be available for several months because of the complexity of the testing.\n                \nThe usefulness of genetic testing for Alagille syndrome is limited by two factors:\n                \n- Detection of a mutated gene cannot predict the onset of symptoms or how serious the disorder will be.  - Even if a mutated gene is found, no specific cure for the disorder exists.\n                \n\n                \nWhen to Consider Genetic Counseling   People who are considering genetic testing may want to consult a genetics counselor. Genetic counseling can help family members understand how test results may affect them individually and as a family. Genetic counseling is provided by genetics professionalshealth care professionals with specialized degrees and experience in medical genetics and counseling. Genetics professionals include geneticists, genetics counselors, and genetics nurses.   Genetics professionals work as members of health care teams, providing information and support to individuals or families who have genetic disorders or a higher chance of having an inherited condition. Genetics professionals   - assess the likelihood of a genetic disorder by researching a family's history, evaluating medical records, and conducting a physical exam of the patient and other family members   - weigh the medical, social, and ethical decisions surrounding genetic testing   - provide support and information to help a person make a decision about testing   - interpret the results of genetic tests and medical data   - provide counseling or refer individuals and families to support services   - serve as patient advocates   - explain possible treatments or preventive measures   - discuss reproductive options    Genetic counseling may be useful when a family member is deciding whether to have genetic testing and again later when test results are available.",

        "original_answer": "Treatment for Alagille syndrome includes medications and therapies that increase the flow of bile from the liver, promote growth and development in infants' and children's bodies, correct nutritional deficiencies, and reduce the person's discomfort. Ursodiol (Actigall, Urso) is a medication that increases bile flow. Other treatments address specific symptoms of the disorder.\n                \nLiver failure. People with Alagille syndrome who develop end-stage liver failure need a liver transplant with a whole liver from a deceased donor or a segment of a liver from a living donor. People with Alagille syndrome who also have heart problems may not be candidates for a transplant because they could be more likely to have complications during and after the procedure. A liver transplant surgical team performs the transplant in a hospital.\n                \nMore information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Liver Transplantation.\n                \nPruritus. Itching may decrease when the flow of bile from the liver is increased. Medications such as cholestyramine (Prevalite), rifampin (Rifadin, Rimactane), naltrexone (Vivitrol), or antihistamines may be prescribed to relieve pruritus. People should hydrate their skin with moisturizers and keep their fingernails trimmed to prevent skin damage from scratching. People with Alagille syndrome should avoid baths and take short showers to prevent the skin from drying out.\n                \nIf severe pruritus does not improve with medication, a procedure called partial external biliary diversion may provide relief from itching. The procedure involves surgery to connect one end of the small intestine to the gallbladder and the other end to an opening in the abdomencalled a stomathrough which bile leaves the body and is collected in a pouch. A surgeon performs partial external biliary diversion in a hospital. The patient will need general anesthesia.\n                \nMalabsorption and growth problems. Infants with Alagille syndrome are given a special formula that helps the small intestine absorb much-needed fat. Infants, children, and adults can benefit from a high-calorie diet, calcium, and vitamins A, D, E, and K. They may also need additional zinc. If someone with Alagille syndrome does not tolerate oral doses of vitamins, a health care provider may give the person injections for a period of time. A child may receive additional calories through a tiny tube that is passed through the nose into the stomach. If extra calories are needed for a long time, a health care provider may place a tube, called a gastrostomy tube, directly into the stomach through a small opening made in the abdomen. A child's growth may improve with increased nutrition and flow of bile from the liver.\n                \nXanthomas. For someone who has Alagille syndrome, these fatty deposits typically worsen over the first few years of life and then improve over time. They may eventually disappear in response to partial external biliary diversion or the medications used to increase bile flow.",

Approximately 30 to 50 percent of people with Alagille syndrome have an inherited gene mutation, meaning it has been passed on by a parent.  - Alagille syndrome occurs in about one of every 30,000 live births. The disorder affects both sexes equally and shows no geographical, racial, or ethnic preferences.  - The gene mutations that cause Alagille syndrome may cause mild or subtle symptoms. Some people may not know they are affected.  - The signs and symptoms of Alagille syndrome and their severity vary, even among people in the same family sharing the same gene mutation.  - In some people, problems in the liver may be the first signs and symptoms of the disorder.  - The complications of Alagille syndrome include liver failure, portal hypertension, and growth problems.  - Ten to 30 percent of people with Alagille syndrome will eventually need a liver transplant.  - A health care provider diagnoses Alagille syndrome by performing a thorough physical exam and other tests.  - Genetic counseling can help family members understand how genetic test results may affect them individually and as a family.  - Treatment for Alagille syndrome includes medications and therapies that increase the flow of bile from the liver, promote growth and development in infants' and children's bodies, correct nutritional deficiencies, and reduce the person's discomfort.  - Scientists have not yet found a way to prevent Alagille syndrome.  - Caregivers and parents of children with Alagille syndrome should try to maximize their children's potential for growth through good eating, diet, and nutrition.",

        "original_answer": "Type 2 diabetes, formerly called adult-onset diabetes, is the most common type of diabetes. About 95 percent of people with diabetes have type 2. People can develop type 2 diabetes at any age, even during childhood. However, this type of diabetes develops most often in middle-aged and older people. People who are overweight and inactive are also more likely to develop type 2 diabetes.\n                \nIn type 2 and other types of diabetes, you have too much glucose, also called sugar, in your blood. People with diabetes have problems converting food to energy. After a meal, food is broken down into glucose, which is carried by your blood to cells throughout your body. With the help of the hormone insulin, cells absorb glucose from your blood and use it for energy. Insulin is made in the pancreas, an organ located behind the stomach.\n                \nType 2 diabetes usually begins with insulin resistance, a condition linked to excess weight in which your bodys cells do not use insulin properly. As a result, your body needs more insulin to help glucose enter cells. At first, your pancreas keeps up with the added demand by producing more insulin. But in time, your pancreas loses its ability to produce enough insulin, and blood glucose levels rise.\n                \nOver time, high blood glucose damages nerves and blood vessels, leading to problems such as heart disease, stroke, kidney disease, blindness, dental disease, and amputations. Other problems of diabetes may include increased risk of getting other diseases, loss of mobility with aging, depression, and pregnancy problems.\n                \nTreatment includes taking diabetes medicines, making wise food choices, being physically active on a regular basis, controlling blood pressure and cholesterol, and for some, taking aspirin daily.",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "To prevent type 2 diabetes, you can take the following steps:\n\n1. Maintain a healthy weight: If you are overweight, losing even a small amount of weight can help prevent or delay diabetes.\n2. Eat a healthy diet: Aim for a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein sources. Limit processed foods, sugary drinks, and saturated fats.\n3. Get regular exercise: Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise, such as brisk walking, on most days of the week.\n4. Quit smoking: Smoking can increase your risk of developing diabetes and other health problems.\n5. Limit alcohol: Too much alcohol can lead to weight gain and may increase your risk of diabetes.\n6. Manage stress: High levels of stress can affect your blood sugar levels. Practice stress-reducing activities like yoga, meditation, or deep breathing.\n7. Get regular check-ups: Regularly monitor your blood sugar levels and have regular check-ups with your doctor to monitor your risk for diabetes.\n\nBy following these steps, you can significantly reduce your risk of developing type 2 diabetes.",
        "original_answer": "Yes. The results of the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) proved that weight loss through moderate diet changes and physical activity can delay or prevent type 2 diabetes. The DPP was a federally funded study of 3,234 people at high risk for diabetes. This study showed that a 5-to 7-percent weight loss, which for a 200-pound person would be 10 to 14 pounds, slowed development of type 2 diabetes.\n                \nPeople at High Risk for Diabetes\n                \nDPP study participants were overweight and had higher than normal levels of blood glucose, a condition called prediabetes. Many had family members with type 2 diabetes. Prediabetes, obesity, and a family history of diabetes are strong risk factors for type 2 diabetes. About half of the DPP participants were from minority groups with high rates of diabetes, including African Americans, Alaska Natives, American Indians, Asian Americans, Hispanics/Latinos, and Pacific Islander Americans.\n                \nDPP participants also included others at high risk for developing type 2 diabetes, such as women with a history of gestational diabetes and people age 60 and older.\n                \nApproaches to Preventing Diabetes\n                \nThe DPP tested three approaches to preventing diabetes:\n                \n- Making lifestyle changes. People in the lifestyle change group exercised, usually by walking 5 days a week for about 30 minutes a day, and lowered their intake of fat and calories.  - Taking the diabetes medicine metformin. Those who took metformin also received information about physical activity and diet.  - Receiving education about diabetes. The third group only received information about physical activity and diet and took a placeboa pill without medicine in it.\n                \nPeople in the lifestyle change group showed the best outcomes. But people who took metformin also benefited. The results showed that by losing an average of 15 pounds in the first year of the study, people in the lifestyle change group reduced their risk of developing type 2 diabetes by 58 percent over 3 years. Lifestyle change was even more effective in those age 60 and older. People in this group reduced their risk by 71 percent. But people in the metformin group also benefited, reducing their risk by 31 percent. More information about the DPP, funded under National Institutes of Health (NIH) clinical trial number NCT00004992, is available at www.bsc.gwu.edu/dpp.\n                \nLasting Results\n                \nThe Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study (DPPOS) has shown that the benefits of weight loss and metformin last for at least 10 years. The DPPOS has continued to follow most DPP participants since the DPP ended in 2001. The DPPOS showed that 10 years after enrolling in the DPP,\n                \n- people in the lifestyle change group reduced their risk for developing diabetes by 34 percent  - those in the lifestyle change group age 60 or older had even greater benefit, reducing their risk of developing diabetes by 49 percent  - participants in the lifestyle change group also had fewer heart and blood vessel disease risk factors, including lower blood pressure and triglyceride levels, even though they took fewer medicines to control their heart disease risk  - the metformin group reduced the risk of developing diabetes by 18 percent\n                \nEven though controlling your weight with lifestyle changes is challenging, it produces long-term health rewards by lowering your risk for type 2 diabetes, lowering your blood glucose levels, and reducing other heart disease risk factors. More information about the DPPOS, funded under NIH clinical trial number NCT00038727, can be found at www.bsc.gwu.edu/dpp.\n                \n\n                \nOther Types of Diabetes   In addition to type 2, the other main types of diabetes are type 1 diabetes and gestational diabetes.  Type 1 Diabetes   Type 1 diabetes, formerly called juvenile diabetes, is usually first diagnosed in children, teenagers, and young adults. In this type of diabetes, your pancreas can no longer make insulin because your bodys immune system has attacked and destroyed the cells that make it. Treatment for type 1 diabetes includes taking insulin shots or using an insulin pump, making wise food choices, being physically active on a regular basis, controlling blood pressure and cholesterol, and, for some, taking aspirin daily.  Gestational Diabetes   Gestational diabetes is a type of diabetes that develops only during pregnancy. Hormones produced by your placenta and other pregnancy-related factors contribute to insulin resistance, which occurs in all women during late pregnancy. Insulin resistance increases the amount of insulin needed to control blood glucose levels. If your pancreas cant produce enough insulin, gestational diabetes occurs.   As with type 2 diabetes, excess weight is linked to gestational diabetes. Overweight or obese women are at particularly high risk for gestational diabetes because they start pregnancy with a higher need for insulin due to insulin resistance. Excessive weight gain during pregnancy may also increase risk. Gestational diabetes occurs more often in some ethnic groups and among women with a family history of diabetes.   Although gestational diabetes usually goes away after the baby is born, a woman who has had gestational diabetes is more likely to develop type 2 diabetes later in life. Babies born to mothers who had gestational diabetes are also more likely to develop obesity and type 2 diabetes as they grow up.",

Activity helps you lose weight; keeps your blood glucose, blood pressure, and cholesterol under control; and helps your body use insulin. People in the DPP who were physically active for 30 minutes a day, 5 days a week, reduced their risk of type 2 diabetes. Many chose brisk walking as their physical activity.\n                \nIf you are not fairly active, you should start slowly. First, talk with your doctor about what kinds of physical activity are safe for you. Make a plan to increase your activity level toward the goal of being active at least 30 minutes a day most days of the week. You can increase your level of physical activity in two main ways:\n                \n1. Start an exercise program. 2. Increase your daily activity.\n                \nStart an exercise program. Pick exercises that suit you. Find a friend to walk with you or join an exercise class that will help you keep going.\n                \n- Do aerobic activities, which use your large muscles to make your heart beat faster. The large muscles are those of the upper and lower arms; upper and lower legs; and those that control head, shoulder, and hip movements.  - Do activities to strengthen muscles and bone, such as lifting weights or sit-ups, two to three times a week. Find helpsuch as a video or a classto learn how to do these exercises properly.\n                \nIncrease your daily activity. Choose activities you enjoy. You can work extra activity into your daily routine by doing the following:\n                \n- Increase daily activity by decreasing time spent watching TV or at the computer. Set up a reminder on your computer to take an activity break.  - Take the stairs rather than an elevator or escalator.  - Park at the far end of the parking lot and walk.  - Get off the bus a few stops early and walk the rest of the way.  - Walk or bicycle whenever you can.\n                \n\n                \nTake Your Prescribed Medicines\n                \nSome people need medicine to help control their blood pressure or cholesterol levels.

Being overweight can keep your body from making and using insulin properly. Excess body weight can also cause high blood pressure. Every pound you lose lowers your risk of getting diabetes.\n                \nIn addition to weight, the location of excess fat on the body can be important. A waist measurement of 40 inches or more for men and 35 inches or more for women is linked to insulin resistance and increases a persons risk for type 2 diabetes.

The BMI can help you find out whether you are normal weight, overweight, or obese. Use the table on pages 24 and 25 to find your BMI.\n                \n- Find your height in the left-hand column.  - Move across in the same row to the number closest to your weight.  - The number at the top of that column is your BMI. Check the word above your BMI to see whether you are normal weight, overweight, or obese.\n                \nThe BMI has certain limitations. The BMI may overestimate body fat in athletes and others who have a muscular build and underestimate body fat in older adults and others who have lost muscle.\n                \nThe BMI for children and teens must be determined based on age, height, weight, and sex. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has information about BMI in children and teens, including a BMI calculator, at www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dnpa/bmi. The CDC website also has a BMI calculator for adults. A BMI calculator from the NIH is available at www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/educational/lose_wt/BMI/bmicalc.htm.\n                \nThe NIH also has a free smartphone app for calculating BMI.

        "original_answer": "Insurance companies sell private health insurance plans. Two types of private health insurance are\n                \n- Group health insurance. People may be eligible to purchase group health insurance through their employer or union or through a family members employer or union. Other organizations, such as professional or alumni organizations, may also offer group health insurance.  - Individual health insurance. People may purchase individual health insurance for themselves and their families. The website HealthCare.gov provides information about individual insurance plans. The website also provides a search function, called the Health Insurance Marketplace, to find health insurance options by state. Depending on their income and family size, some people may qualify for lower-cost premiums through the Health Insurance Marketplace. People can select or change individual health insurance plans during the open enrollment period each year. HealthCare.gov lists open enrollment period dates. The website also provides information about life events that may allow people to enroll outside the open enrollment period.\n                \nEmployers may have a waiting period before an employee and his or her family members can enroll in the company health plan. Under the ACA, the waiting period can be no longer than 90 days. Certain health plans called health maintenance organizations (HMOs) may have an affiliation perioda time that must pass before health insurance coverage becomes effective. An affiliation period can be no longer than 3 months.\n                \nThe ACA expanded coverage of preventive services. For example, adults with sustained high blood pressure may have access to diabetes screening at no cost. Adults and children may have access to obesity screening and counseling at no cost.\n                \nEach states insurance regulatory office, sometimes called the state insurance department or commission, provides more information about health insurance laws. This office can also help identify an insurance company that offers individual coverage. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners website, www.naic.org/state_web_map.htm , provides a membership list with contact information and a link to the website for each states insurance regulatory office.\n                \nThe ADA also provides information about health insurance options at www.diabetes.org/living-with-diabetes/health-insurance .\n                \nKeeping Group Health Insurance after Leaving a Job\n                \nWhen leaving a job, a person may be able to continue the group health insurance provided by his or her employer for up to 18 months under a federal law called the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, or COBRA. Although people pay more for group health insurance through COBRA than they did as employees, group coverage may be cheaper than individual coverage. People who have a disability before becoming eligible for COBRA or who are determined by the Social Security Administration to be disabled within the first 60 days of COBRA coverage may be able to extend COBRA coverage an additional 11 months, for up to 29 months of coverage. COBRA may also cover young adults who were insured under a parents policy after they have reached the age limit and are trying to obtain their own insurance.\n                \nRead more at www.dol.gov/dol/topic/health-plans/cobra.htm or call the U.S. Department of Labor at 18664USADOL (18664872365).\n                \nIf a person doesnt qualify for coverage or if COBRA coverage has expired, other options may be available:\n                \n- Some states require employers to offer conversion policies, in which people stay with their insurance company and buy individual coverage.  - Some professional and alumni organizations offer group coverage for members.  - Some insurance companies offer short-term stopgap policies designed for people who are between jobs. However, these policies may not meet ACA requirements. For example, they may not cover preexisting conditions.  - People can purchase individual health insurance policies.\n                \nEach states insurance regulatory office can provide more information about these and other options.

        "original_answer": "Medicare is a federal health insurance program that pays health care costs for eligible people who are\n                \n- age 65 or older  - under age 65 with certain disabilities  - of any age with end-stage renal diseasetotal and permanent kidney failure that requires a kidney transplant or blood-filtering treatments called dialysis\n                \nWhat health plans does Medicare offer?\n                \nMedicare has four parts:\n                \n- Part A (hospital insurance) covers inpatient care, skilled nursing home residence, hospice care, and home health care. Part A has no premium for those who have paid enough Medicare taxes. A premium is an amount a person must pay periodicallymonthly or quarterlyfor Medicare, other health plan, or drug plan coverage. Part A does have a deductible, an amount a person must pay for health care or prescriptions before the health plan will pay. A person must pay a daily amount for hospital stays that last longer than 60 days.  - Part B (medical insurance) covers services from health care providers, outpatient care, home health care, durable medical equipment, and some preventative services. Part B has a monthly premium based on a persons income. Rates change each year. After a person pays the deductible each year, Part B pays 80 percent for most covered services as a primary payer. The billing staff of the service providerhospital or cliniccan calculate how much a person will owe.  - Part C (Medicare Advantage Plans) are part of Medicare and are sometimes called MA Plans. Medicare must approve Medicare Advantage Plans. Each Medicare Advantage Plan must cover Part A and Part B services and may cover other services, too. Medicare Advantage Plans may have Part D prescription coverage. If not, a person can buy a Part D plan separately. Medicare Advantage Plans are not all the same. A person who is thinking of choosing a Medicare Advantage Plan should ask about the rules of the plan. The rules may specify which health care providers or hospitals a person may use. The plan may require a referral from a primary care provider to see a specialist. The plan may not cover medical expenses incurred during travel. How much a person has to pay out-of-pocket each year will vary by plan. People who have a Medicare Advantage Plan cannot have a Medigap plan to help pay out of-pocket costs. See the section on Medigap.  Four types of Medicare Advantage Plans are available:      - HMOs    - preferred provider organizations (PPOs)    - private fee for service plans    - special needs plans for certain groups    - Part D (prescription drug coverage) has a premium and covers some medications. Private insurance companies offer different Part D plans approved by Medicare. Costs and coverage vary by plan. A person who has few assets and earns less than 150 percent of the federal poverty level may qualify for extra help to pay Part D premiums and medication costs. People can apply for this help by calling the Social Security Administration, visiting www.socialsecurity.gov to apply online, visiting their local Social Security office, or contacting their state medical assistance (Medicaid) office. People can find the current-year guidelines at www.aspe.hhs.gov/poverty or by calling Social Security at 18007721213, TTY 18003250778. People can find information and applications for Part D plans at www.medicare.gov. A person can also apply for Part D with an insurance company that sells one of these plans.\n                \nOther Medicare health plans are for certain groups, such as frail people living in the community and people with multiple chronic illnesses, and include hospital and medical coverage. Some pay for prescribed medications, too. State health insurance programscalled Medicaidpartially finance and administer these services. The plans include the following:\n                \n- Medicare Cost Plans are HMOs, like the ones offered as Medicare Advantage plans, only out-of-network providers are paid as if the policyholder had Original Medicare. Original Medicare is Medicare Part A and Part B.  - Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE) combines medical, social, and long-term care services for frail people who live and get health care in the community.  - Medicare Innovation Projects are special projects that test improvements in Medicare coverage, payment, and quality of care.\n                \nRead more about Medicare Cost Plans and Demonstration or Pilot Programs on the state Medicaid website at www.medicaid.gov or call 1800MEDICARE (18006334227).

However, coinsurance or deductibles may apply. A person must have Medicare Part B or Medicare Part D to receive these covered services and supplies.\n                \nMedicare Part B helps pay for\n                \n- diabetes screening tests for people at risk of developing diabetes  - diabetes self-management training  - diabetes supplies such as glucose monitors, test strips, and lancets  - insulin pumps and insulin if used with an insulin pump  - counseling to help people who are obese lose weight  - flu and pneumonia shots  - foot exams and treatment for people with diabetes  - eye exams to check for glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy  - medical nutrition therapy services for people with diabetes or kidney disease, when referred by a health care provider  - therapeutic shoes or inserts, in some cases\n                \nMedicare Part D helps pay for\n                \n- diabetes medications  - insulin, excluding insulin used with an insulin pump  - diabetes supplies such as needles and syringes for injecting insulin\n                \nPeople who are in a Medicare Advantage Plan or other Medicare health plan should check their plans membership materials and call for details about how the plan provides the diabetes services, supplies, and medications covered by Medicare.\n                \nRead more at www.medicare.gov/publications/pubs/pdf/11022.pdf (PDF, 1,023 KB) or call 1800MEDICARE (18006334227) to request the free booklet Medicares Coverage of Diabetes Supplies & Services.\n                \nWhere can a person find more information about Medicare?\n                \nA person can find more information about Medicare by\n                \n- visiting the Medicare website  - calling 1800MEDICARE\n                \nMedicare website.

        "original_answer": "- Diabetes management and treatment is expensive. Many people who have diabetes need help paying for their care. For those who qualify, a variety of government and nongovernment programs can help cover health care expenses.  - Health insurance helps pay for medical care, including the cost of diabetes care. Health insurance options include private health insurance and government health insurance.  - Insurance companies sell private health insurance plans. Two types of private health insurance are group health insurance and individual health insurance.  - Medicare is a federal health insurance program that pays health care costs for eligible people who are age 65 or older, under age 65 with certain disabilities, or of any age with end-stage renal disease.  - Medicaid is a state health insurance program for those with low incomes and few assets. Each state runs its own program.  - The Childrens Health Insurance Program (CHIP) gives free or low-cost Medicaid to children whose parents earn too much for Medicaid, though not enough to pay for a health plan.  - Many local governments have public health departments that can help people who need medical care. Local resources such as charitable groups may offer financial help for some expenses related to diabetes.  - People should talk with their health care providers if they have problems paying for diabetes medications. Less expensive generic medications for diabetes, blood pressure, and cholesterol are available. If a health care provider prescribes medications that a person cannot afford, the person should ask the health care provider about cheaper alternatives.  - Health care providers may also be able to assist people who need help paying for their medications and diabetes testing supplies, such as glucose test strips, by providing free samples or referring them to local programs. Drug companies that sell insulin or diabetes medications often have patient assistance programs.",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Interstitial Cystitis/Painful Bladder Syndrome (IC/PBS) is a chronic bladder condition characterized by pain, pressure, and/or discomfort in the bladder and pelvic area. Here are some key points to understand about IC/PBS:\n\n1. Cause: The exact cause of IC/PBS is unknown, but it may be related to a defect in the bladder lining, inflammation, autoimmune issues, or nerve damage.\n2. Symptoms: The main symptoms of IC/PBS include pelvic pain, pressure, or discomfort, often accompanied by frequent urination, urgent urination, and nocturia (waking up at night to urinate). Symptoms can range from mild to severe and may fluctuate over time.\n3. Diagnosis: Diagnosing IC/PBS can be challenging, as there is no definitive test for the condition. Your doctor may perform various tests, such as a urinalysis, cystoscopy, or pelvic exam, to rule out other conditions. A diagnosis of IC/PBS is typically made when other conditions have been excluded, and symptoms persist.\n4. Treatment: Treatment for IC/PBS is individualized and often involves a combination of lifestyle modifications, physical therapy, and medications. Common treatments include:\n\t* Dietary changes: Avoiding certain foods and beverages that may irritate the bladder\n\t* Bladder training: Techniques to help increase the time between each bathroom visit\n\t* Physical therapy: Pelvic floor exercises to help alleviate pain and improve bladder function\n\t* Medications: Oral medications, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), antihistamines, or tricyclic antidepressants, as well as bladder instillations (medications placed directly into the bladder)\n\t* Nerve stimulation: Procedures that stimulate the nerves responsible for bladder function\n5.

        "original_answer": "Signs of bladder problems include\n                \n-  Urgency. The feeling that you need to go right now! Urgency is normal if you haven't been near a bathroom for a few hours or if you have been drinking a lot of fluids. But you may have a problem if you have strong urges before your bladder has had time to fill. All of a sudden, you feel a strong urge to go. At times, you may even have an accident because the urge strikes so quickly you don't have time to find a bathroom.    - Frequency. The feeling that you need to go much more often than anyone else. Doctors and nurses use the term void, which means to empty the bladder. Most people void between four and seven times a day. Drinking large amounts of fluid can cause more frequent voiding. Taking blood pressure medicines called diuretics, or water pills, can also cause more frequent voiding. If you void more than eight times a day, and you dont take diuretics or drink large amounts of fluid, it may be the sign of a problem.  - Pain. The feeling of more than discomfort when you need to go. Having a full bladder may be uncomfortable, but it should not be painful. You may have a problem if you feel burning or sharp pain in your bladder or urethrathe opening where urine leaves the body.\n                \nSome people may have pain without urgency or frequency.

The exact cause is unknown, but several factors may contribute to its development:\n\n1. Bladder wall changes: Some research suggests that the bladder wall of IC/PBS patients may have increased sensitivity, leading to pain and discomfort.\n2. Damaged or malfunctioning bladder lining: In IC/PBS patients, the protective layer lining the bladder may have defects, allowing irritating substances in urine to irritate the bladder wall.\n3. Nerve damage or dysfunction: Abnormalities in the nerves connecting the bladder and the brain may cause the bladder to be overactive or underactive, leading to IC/PBS symptoms.\n4. Autoimmune disorders: IC/PBS may be associated with autoimmune conditions, such as lupus or irritable bowel syndrome, where the body's immune system mistakenly attacks healthy cells.\n5. Infection: Although IC/PBS is not caused by a bacterial infection like a typical urinary tract infection, some patients may have low-grade, non-bacterial infections that contribute to their symptoms.\n6. Genetics: IC/PBS may have a genetic component, as it seems to run in families, but more research is needed to confirm this.\n\nIt is essential to consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan if you suspect you have IC/PBS.",

It's typically diagnosed through a process of elimination, as there is no definitive test for IC/PBS. Here's a general overview of the diagnostic process:\n\n1. Medical History: Your doctor will start by asking about your symptoms, medical history, and any potential bladder irritants or allergens.\n\n2. Physical Examination: A pelvic exam may be performed to check for any physical abnormalities.\n\n3. Urinalysis: This test will check for signs of infection, kidney stones, or other conditions that could be causing your symptoms.\n\n4. Cystoscopy: This is a procedure where a thin tube with a camera is inserted into the bladder to examine the bladder lining. In some cases, a bladder distention (filling the bladder with fluid to expand it) may be performed during this procedure.\n\n5. Potassium Sensitivity Test: This test involves instilling a solution of potassium chloride into the bladder to see if it causes pain, which can indicate IC/PBS.\n\n6. Biopsy: In some cases, a small sample of the bladder tissue may be taken for further testing.\n\n7. Exclusion of Other Conditions: Other conditions such as urinary tract infections, bladder cancer, endometriosis, and vaginal infections need to be ruled out before a diagnosis of IC/PBS is made.\n\nRemember, it's important to consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan.",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Interstitial Cystitis/Painful Bladder Syndrome (IC/PBS) can be managed with a variety of treatments, and what works best can vary from person to person. Here are some common treatment options:\n\n1. **Pelvic floor physical therapy:** This can help to relieve pain and improve bladder capacity.\n\n2. **Oral medications:** These can include pain relievers, antihistamines, and medications that help to protect the bladder lining.\n\n3. **Bladder instillations:** This involves instilling a solution directly into the bladder through a catheter.

It may take some time to find the right treatment or combination of treatments that work best for you. Always consult with a healthcare professional for accurate information.",
        "original_answer": "No one treatment for IC/PBS has been found that works for everyone. Your doctor or nurse will work with you to find a treatment plan that meets your special needs. The plan may include diet and lifestyle changes, bladder retraining, activity and exercise, physical therapy, and various types of medicines. You should expect some treatment failures along the way, but, with time, you and your doctor or nurse should find a treatment that gives you some relief and helps you cope with your disease.\n                \nDiet and Lifestyle Changes\n                \nSome people with IC/PBS find that certain foods or drinks bring on their symptoms. Others find no link between symptoms and what they eat.\n                \nLearning what foods cause symptoms for you may require some trial and error. Keep a food diary and note the times you have bladder pain. The diary might reveal that your flare-ups always happen, for example, after you eat tomatoes or oranges.\n                \nSome doctors recommend taking an antacid medicine with meals. The medicine reduces the amount of acid that gets into the urine.\n                \nIf you make changes to your diet, remember to eat a variety of healthy foods.\n                \nBladder Retraining\n                \nBladder retraining is a way to help your bladder hold more urine. People with bladder pain often get in the habit of using the bathroom as soon as they feel pain or urgency. They then feel the need to go before the bladder is really full. The body may get used to frequent voiding. Bladder retraining helps your bladder hold more urine before signaling the urge to urinate.\n                \nKeep a bladder diary to track how you are doing. Start by noting the times when you void. Note how much time goes by between voids. For example, you may find that you return to the bathroom every 40 minutes.\n                \nTry to stretch out the time between voids. If you usually void every 40 minutes, try to wait at least 50 minutes before you go to the bathroom.\n                \nIf your bladder becomes painful, you may use the bathroom. But you may find that your first urge to use the bathroom goes away if you ignore it. Find ways to relax or distract yourself when the first urge strikes.\n                \nAfter a few days, you may be able to stretch the time out to 60 or 70 minutes, and you may find that the urge to urinate does not return as soon.\n                \nActivity\n                \nIf you have IC/PBS, you may feel the last thing you want to do is exercise. But many people feel that easy activities like walking or gentle stretching exercises help relieve symptoms.\n                \nPhysical Therapy\n                \nYour doctor or nurse may suggest pelvic exercises. The pelvic muscles hold the bladder in place and help control urination. The first step is to find the right muscle to squeeze. A doctor, nurse, or physical therapist can help you. One way to find the muscles is to imagine that you are trying to stop passing gas. Squeeze the muscles you would use. If you sense a \"pulling\" feeling, you have found the right muscles for pelvic exercises.\n                \nYou may need exercises to strengthen those muscles so that it's easier to hold in urine. Or you may need to learn to relax your pelvic muscles if tense muscles are part of your bladder pain.\n                \nSome physical therapists specialize in helping people with pelvic pain. Ask your doctor or nurse to help you find a professional trained in pelvic floor physical therapy.\n                \nReducing Stress\n                \nStress doesn't cause IC/PBS. But stress can trigger painful flare-ups in someone who has IC/PBS. Learning to reduce stress in your life by making time for relaxation every day may help control some symptoms of IC/PBS.\n                \nOral Medicines\n                \nPain pills like aspirin, ibuprofen, or acetominophen can help control mild bladder pain. Advil and Motrin are examples of ibuprofen. Tylenol is an example of acetominophen. Talk with your doctor if you feel you need a stronger pain medicine.\n                \nYour doctor may recommend a medication, pentosan polysulfate sodium, sold as Elmiron, which is approved for treating the pain of IC/PBS. You may need to take this medicine for up to 6 months before you notice improvement. Elmiron does not work for everyone, but some people with IC/PBS have found relief taking it. You need a doctor's order for Elmiron. If you don't notice improvement of your symptoms in 6 months, this medicine is not likely to work.\n                \nResearchers are also looking at other kinds of medicines. Medicines that treat heartburn might help bladder symptoms by reducing the amount of acid made in the body. Muscle relaxants can keep the bladder from squeezing at the wrong time. Keeping the bladder muscle relaxed helps ease the symptoms of IC/PBS.\n                \nBladder Stretching\n                \nThe doctor may stretch the bladder by filling it with liquid. You will be given an anesthetic to prevent pain and help relax your bladder muscles. Some patients have said their symptoms were helped after this treatment.\n                \nBladder Medicines\n                \nMany patients who have IC/PBS find relief after a treatment in which their bladders are filled with a liquid medicine. The doctor guides a tube into your bladder and slowly fills the bladder with a liquid that eases irritation of the bladder wall. The liquid may be a compound called DMSO or a solution that contains heparin and a pain medicine called lidocaine.\n                \nYou will keep the liquid in your bladder for about 15 minutes and then release it. You can have this treatment once every week or every other week for 1 or 2 months. You may not feel any better until the third or fourth treatment.\n                \nNerve Stimulation\n                \nIf you have tried diet changes, exercise, and medicines and nothing seems to help, you may wish to think about nerve stimulation. This treatment sends mild electrical pulses to the nerves that control the bladder.\n                \nAt first, you may try a system that sends the pulses through electrodes placed on your skin. If this therapy works for you, you may consider having a device put in your body. The device delivers small pulses of electricity to the nerves around the bladder.\n                \nFor some patients, nerve stimulation relieves bladder pain as well as urinary frequency and urgency. For others, the treatment relieves frequency and urgency but not pain. For still other patients, it does not work.\n                \nScientists are not sure why nerve stimulation works. Some believe that the electrical pulses block the pain signals carried in the nerves. If your brain doesn't receive the nerve signal, you don't feel the pain. Others believe that the electricity releases endorphins, which are hormones that block pain naturally.\n                \nSurgery\n                \nAs a last resort, your doctor might suggest surgery to remove part or all of the bladder. Surgery does not cure the pain of IC/PBS in all cases, but if you have tried every other option and your pain is still unbearable, surgery might be considered.\n                \nTalk with your doctor and family about the possible benefits and side effects.",

The prostate is a small gland that surrounds the urethra, the tube that carries urine and semen out of the body.

It is important to note that BPH is a benign condition, meaning it is not a threat to life, but it can significantly impact quality of life. Treatment options for BPH include medication, lifestyle changes, and minimally invasive procedures or surgery.",
        "original_answer": "Benign prostatic hyperplasiaalso called BPHis a condition in men in which the prostate gland is enlarged and not cancerous. Benign prostatic hyperplasia is also called benign prostatic hypertrophy or benign prostatic obstruction.\n                \nThe prostate goes through two main growth periods as a man ages. The first occurs early in puberty, when the prostate doubles in size. The second phase of growth begins around age 25 and continues during most of a mans life. Benign prostatic hyperplasia often occurs with the second growth phase.\n                \nAs the prostate enlarges, the gland presses against and pinches the urethra. The bladder wall becomes thicker. Eventually, the bladder may weaken and lose the ability to empty completely, leaving some urine in the bladder. The narrowing of the urethra and urinary retentionthe inability to empty the bladder completelycause many of the problems associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia.",

        "original_answer": "The prostate is a walnut-shaped gland that is part of the male reproductive system. The main function of the prostate is to make a fluid that goes into semen. Prostate fluid is essential for a mans fertility. The gland surrounds the urethra at the neck of the bladder. The bladder neck is the area where the urethra joins the bladder. The bladder and urethra are parts of the lower urinary tract. The prostate has two or more lobes, or sections, enclosed by an outer layer of tissue, and it is in front of the rectum, just below the bladder. The urethra is the tube that carries urine from the bladder to the outside of the body. In men, the urethra also carries semen out through the penis.",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH), or prostate enlargement, is caused by the natural aging process. As men get older, the prostate gland slowly begins to grow. This growth is usually caused by changes in the cells due to hormonal imbalances.\n\nThe prostate gland is about the size of a walnut and surrounds the urethra, the tube that carries urine and semen out of the body. As the prostate enlarges, it can squeeze or constrict the urethra, leading to difficulties with urination, which is the primary symptom of BPH.\n\nIt is essential to note that BPH is not cancerous and does not increase the risk of prostate cancer. However, it can cause discomfort and affect quality of life, so it is essential to consult a healthcare professional if you experience symptoms.",
        "original_answer": "The cause of benign prostatic hyperplasia is not well understood; however, it occurs mainly in older men. Benign prostatic hyperplasia does not develop in men whose testicles were removed before puberty. For this reason, some researchers believe factors related to aging and the testicles may cause benign prostatic hyperplasia.\n                \nThroughout their lives, men produce testosterone, a male hormone, and small amounts of estrogen, a female hormone. As men age, the amount of active testosterone in their blood decreases, which leaves a higher proportion of estrogen. Scientific studies have suggested that benign prostatic hyperplasia may occur because the higher proportion of estrogen within the prostate increases the activity of substances that promote prostate cell growth.\n                \nAnother theory focuses on dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a male hormone that plays a role in prostate development and growth. Some research has indicated that even with a drop in blood testosterone levels, older men continue to produce and accumulate high levels of DHT in the prostate. This accumulation of DHT may encourage prostate cells to continue to grow. Scientists have noted that men who do not produce DHT do not develop benign prostatic hyperplasia.",

This condition, called acute urinary retention, can result from taking over-the-counter cold or allergy medications that contain decongestants, such as pseudoephedrine and oxymetazoline. A potential side effect of these medications may prevent the bladder neck from relaxing and releasing urine. Medications that contain antihistamines, such as diphenhydramine, can weaken the contraction of bladder muscles and cause urinary retention, difficulty urinating, and painful urination. When men have partial urethra blockage, urinary retention also can occur as a result of alcohol consumption, cold temperatures, or a long period of inactivity.",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH), or prostate enlargement, is typically diagnosed by a healthcare professional using a combination of methods:\n\n1. Medical history: This includes discussing any urinary symptoms, their severity, and how long they have been present.\n2. Physical examination: A digital rectal exam (DRE) is usually performed to assess the size and shape of the prostate gland.\n3. Urine tests: These can help rule out urinary tract infections or other conditions that may be causing symptoms.\n4. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test: This blood test measures the level of PSA, a protein produced by the prostate gland. An elevated PSA level may indicate BPH, but it can also be a sign of prostate cancer.\n5. Imaging tests: In some cases, imaging tests like ultrasound, CT scan, or MRI may be used to further evaluate the prostate gland.\n6. Urodynamic tests: These tests measure the pressure and flow of urine to assess how well the bladder and urethra are functioning.\n\nIt is important to note that a definitive diagnosis of BPH should be made by a healthcare professional.

        "original_answer": "A health care provider diagnoses benign prostatic hyperplasia based on\n                \n- a personal and family medical history  - a physical exam  - medical tests\n                \nPersonal and Family Medical History\n                \nTaking a personal and family medical history is one of the first things a health care provider may do to help diagnose benign prostatic hyperplasia. A health care provider may ask a man\n                \n- what symptoms are present  - when the symptoms began and how often they occur  - whether he has a history of recurrent UTIs  - what medications he takes, both prescription and over the counter  - how much liquid he typically drinks each day  - whether he consumes caffeine and alcohol  - about his general medical history, including any significant illnesses or surgeries\n                \nPhysical Exam\n                \nA physical exam may help diagnose benign prostatic hyperplasia. During a physical exam, a health care provider most often\n                \n- examines a patients body, which can include checking for      - discharge from the urethra    - enlarged or tender lymph nodes in the groin    - a swollen or tender scrotum    - taps on specific areas of the patients body  - performs a digital rectal exam\n                \nA digital rectal exam, or rectal exam, is a physical exam of the prostate. To perform the exam, the health care provider asks the man to bend over a table or lie on his side while holding his knees close to his chest. The health care provider slides a gloved, lubricated finger into the rectum and feels the part of the prostate that lies next to the rectum. The man may feel slight, brief discomfort during the rectal exam. A health care provider most often performs a rectal exam during an office visit, and men do not require anesthesia. The exam helps the health care provider see if the prostate is enlarged or tender or has any abnormalities that require more testing.\n                \nMany health care providers perform a rectal exam as part of a routine physical exam for men age 40 or older, whether or not they have urinary problems.\n                \nMedical Tests\n                \nA health care provider may refer men to a urologista doctor who specializes in urinary problems and the male reproductive systemthough the health care provider most often diagnoses benign prostatic hyperplasia on the basis of symptoms and a digital rectal exam. A urologist uses medical tests to help diagnose lower urinary tract problems related to benign prostatic hyperplasia and recommend treatment. Medical tests may include\n                \n- urinalysis  - a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood test  - urodynamic tests  - cystoscopy  - transrectal ultrasound  - biopsy\n                \nUrinalysis. Urinalysis involves testing a urine sample. The patient collects a urine sample in a special container in a health care providers office or a commercial facility. A health care provider tests the sample during an office visit or sends it to a lab for analysis. For the test, a nurse or technician places a strip of chemically treated paper, called a dipstick, into the urine. Patches on the dipstick change color to indicate signs of infection in urine.\n                \nPSA blood test. A health care provider may draw blood for a PSA test during an office visit or in a commercial facility and send the sample to a lab for analysis. Prostate cells create a protein called PSA. Men who have prostate cancer may have a higher amount of PSA in their blood. However, a high PSA level does not necessarily indicate prostate cancer. In fact, benign prostatic hyperplasia, prostate infections, inflammation, aging, and normal fluctuations often cause high PSA levels. Much remains unknown about how to interpret a PSA blood test, the tests ability to discriminate between cancer and prostate conditions such as benign prostatic hyperplasia, and the best course of action to take if the PSA level is high.\n                \nUrodynamic tests. Urodynamic tests include a variety of procedures that look at how well the bladder and urethra store and release urine. A health care provider performs urodynamic tests during an office visit or in an outpatient center or a hospital. Some urodynamic tests do not require anesthesia; others may require local anesthesia. Most urodynamic tests focus on the bladders ability to hold urine and empty steadily and completely and may include the following:\n                \n- uroflowmetry, which measures how rapidly the bladder releases urine  - postvoid residual measurement, which evaluates how much urine remains in the bladder after urination  - reduced urine flow or residual urine in the bladder, which often suggests urine blockage due to benign prostatic hyperplasia\n                \nMore information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Urodynamic Testing.\n                \nCystoscopy. Cystoscopy is a procedure that uses a tubelike instrument, called a cystoscope, to look inside the urethra and bladder. A urologist inserts the cystoscope through the opening at the tip of the penis and into the lower urinary tract. A urologist performs cystoscopy during an office visit or in an outpatient center or a hospital. The urologist will give the patient local anesthesia; however, in some cases, the patient may require sedation and regional or general anesthesia. A urologist may use cystoscopy to look for blockage or stones in the urinary tract.\n                \nMore information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Cystoscopy and Ureteroscopy.\n                \nTransrectal ultrasound. Transrectal ultrasound uses a device, called a transducer, that bounces safe, painless sound waves off organs to create an image of their structure. The health care provider can move the transducer to different angles to make it possible to examine different organs. A specially trained technician performs the procedure in a health care providers office, an outpatient center, or a hospital, and a radiologista doctor who specializes in medical imaginginterprets the images; the patient does not require anesthesia. Urologists most often use transrectal ultrasound to examine the prostate. In a transrectal ultrasound, the technician inserts a transducer slightly larger than a pen into the mans rectum, next to the prostate. The ultrasound image shows the size of the prostate and any abnormalities, such as tumors. Transrectal ultrasound cannot reliably diagnose prostate cancer.\n                \nBiopsy. Biopsy is a procedure that involves taking a small piece of prostate tissue for examination with a microscope. A urologist performs the biopsy in an outpatient center or a hospital. The urologist will give the patient light sedation and local anesthetic; however, in some cases, the patient will require general anesthesia. The urologist uses imaging techniques such as ultrasound, a computerized tomography scan, or magnetic resonance imaging to guide the biopsy needle into the prostate. A pathologista doctor who specializes in examining tissues to diagnose diseasesexamines the prostate tissue in a lab. The test can show whether prostate cancer is present.\n                \nMore information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Medical Tests for Prostate Problems.",

Medications: There are two types of medications used to treat BPH - alpha blockers and 5-alpha reductase inhibitors. Alpha blockers relax the muscles around the prostate and bladder neck, making it easier to urinate. 5-alpha reductase inhibitors shrink the prostate by preventing the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, a hormone that stimulates prostate growth.\n2. Minimally Invasive Procedures: These procedures are usually recommended when medications are not effective. They include transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), transurethral microwave thermotherapy (TUMT), transurethral needle ablation (TUNA), and laser therapy.\n3. Surgery: Surgery is usually recommended when other treatments are not effective. The most common surgery for BPH is TURP. Other surgical options include simple prostatectomy, laser surgery, and open prostatectomy.\n4. Lifestyle Changes: Lifestyle changes such as reducing fluid intake before bedtime, avoiding caffeine and alcohol, and practicing pelvic floor exercises can also help alleviate the symptoms of BPH.\n\nIt's important to consult with a healthcare provider to determine the best treatment option for each individual.",

In these cases, instead of treatment, a urologist may recommend regular checkups. If benign prostatic hyperplasia symptoms become bothersome or present a health risk, a urologist most often recommends treatment.\n                \nLifestyle Changes\n                \nA health care provider may recommend lifestyle changes for men whose symptoms are mild or slightly bothersome. Lifestyle changes can include\n                \n- reducing intake of liquids, particularly before going out in public or before periods of sleep  - avoiding or reducing intake of caffeinated beverages and alcohol  - avoiding or monitoring the use of medications such as decongestants, antihistamines, antidepressants, and diuretics  - training the bladder to hold more urine for longer periods  - exercising pelvic floor muscles  - preventing or treating constipation\n                \nMedications\n                \nA health care provider or urologist may prescribe medications that stop the growth of or shrink the prostate or reduce symptoms associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia:\n                \n- alpha blockers  - phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors  - 5-alpha reductase inhibitors  - combination medications\n                \nAlpha blockers. These medications relax the smooth muscles of the prostate and bladder neck to improve urine flow and reduce bladder blockage:\n                \n- terazosin (Hytrin)  - doxazosin (Cardura)  - tamsulosin (Flomax)  - alfuzosin (Uroxatral)  - silodosin (Rapaflo)\n                \nPhosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors. Urologists prescribe these medications mainly for erectile dysfunction. Tadalafil (Cialis) belongs to this class of medications and can reduce lower urinary tract symptoms by relaxing smooth muscles in the lower urinary tract. Researchers are working to determine the role of erectile dysfunction drugs in the long-term treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia.\n                \n5-alpha reductase inhibitors. These medications block the production of DHT, which accumulates in the prostate and may cause prostate growth:\n                \n- finasteride (Proscar)  - dutasteride (Avodart)\n                \nThese medications can prevent progression of prostate growth or actually shrink the prostate in some men. Finasteride and dutasteride act more slowly than alpha blockers and are useful for only moderately enlarged prostates.\n                \nCombination medications. Several studies, such as the Medical Therapy of Prostatic Symptoms (MTOPS) study, have shown that combining two classes of medications, instead of using just one, can more effectively improve symptoms, urinary flow, and quality of life. The combinations include\n                \n- finasteride and doxazosin  - dutasteride and tamsulosin (Jalyn), a combination of both medications that is available in a single tablet  - alpha blockers and antimuscarinics\n                \nA urologist may prescribe a combination of alpha blockers and antimuscarinics for patients with overactive bladder symptoms. Overactive bladder is a condition in which the bladder muscles contract uncontrollably and cause urinary frequency, urinary urgency, and urinary incontinence. Antimuscarinics are a class of medications that relax the bladder muscles.\n                \nMinimally Invasive Procedures\n                \nResearchers have developed a number of minimally invasive procedures that relieve benign prostatic hyperplasia symptoms when medications prove ineffective. These procedures include\n                \n- transurethral needle ablation  - transurethral microwave thermotherapy  - high-intensity focused ultrasound  - transurethral electrovaporization  - water-induced thermotherapy  - prostatic stent insertion\n                \nMinimally invasive procedures can destroy enlarged prostate tissue or widen the urethra, which can help relieve blockage and urinary retention caused by benign prostatic hyperplasia.\n                \nUrologists perform minimally invasive procedures using the transurethral method, which involves inserting a cathetera thin, flexible tubeor cystoscope through the urethra to reach the prostate. These procedures may require local, regional, or general anesthesia. Although destroying troublesome prostate tissue relieves many benign prostatic hyperplasia symptoms, tissue destruction does not cure benign prostatic hyperplasia. A urologist will decide which procedure to perform based on the mans symptoms and overall health.\n                \nTransurethral needle ablation. This procedure uses heat generated by radiofrequency energy to destroy prostate tissue. A urologist inserts a cystoscope through the urethra to the prostate. A urologist then inserts small needles through the end of the cystoscope into the prostate. The needles send radiofrequency energy that heats and destroys selected portions of prostate tissue. Shields protect the urethra from heat damage.\n                \nTransurethral microwave thermotherapy. This procedure uses microwaves to destroy prostate tissue. A urologist inserts a catheter through the urethra to the prostate, and a device called an antenna sends microwaves through the catheter to heat selected portions of the prostate. The temperature becomes high enough inside the prostate to destroy enlarged tissue. A cooling system protects the urinary tract from heat damage during the procedure.\n                \nHigh-intensity focused ultrasound. For this procedure, a urologist inserts a special ultrasound probe into the rectum, near the prostate. Ultrasound waves from the probe heat and destroy enlarged prostate tissue.\n                \nTransurethral electrovaporization. For this procedure, a urologist inserts a tubelike instrument called a resectoscope through the urethra to reach the prostate. An electrode attached to the resectoscope moves across the surface of the prostate and transmits an electric current that vaporizes prostate tissue. The vaporizing effect penetrates below the surface area being treated and seals blood vessels, which reduces the risk of bleeding.\n                \nWater-induced thermotherapy. This procedure uses heated water to destroy prostate tissue. A urologist inserts a catheter into the urethra so that a treatment balloon rests in the middle of the prostate. Heated water flows through the catheter into the treatment balloon, which heats and destroys the surrounding prostate tissue. The treatment balloon can target a specific region of the prostate, while surrounding tissues in the urethra and bladder remain protected.\n                \nProstatic stent insertion. This procedure involves a urologist inserting a small device called a prostatic stent through the urethra to the area narrowed by the enlarged prostate. Once in place, the stent expands like a spring, and it pushes back the prostate tissue, widening the urethra. Prostatic stents may be temporary or permanent. Urologists generally use prostatic stents in men who may not tolerate or be suitable for other procedures.\n                \nSurgery\n                \nFor long-term treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia, a urologist may recommend removing enlarged prostate tissue or making cuts in the prostate to widen the urethra. Urologists recommend surgery when\n                \n- medications and minimally invasive procedures are ineffective  - symptoms are particularly bothersome or severe  - complications arise\n                \nAlthough removing troublesome prostate tissue relieves many benign prostatic hyperplasia symptoms, tissue removal does not cure benign prostatic hyperplasia.\n                \nSurgery to remove enlarged prostate tissue includes\n                \n- transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP)  - laser surgery  - open prostatectomy  - transurethral incision of the prostate (TUIP)\n                \nA urologist performs these surgeries, except for open prostatectomy, using the transurethral method. Men who have these surgical procedures require local, regional, or general anesthesia and may need to stay in the hospital.\n                \nThe urologist may prescribe antibiotics before or soon after surgery to prevent infection. Some urologists prescribe antibiotics only when an infection occurs.\n                \nImmediately after benign prostatic hyperplasia surgery, a urologist may insert a special catheter, called a Foley catheter, through the opening of the penis to drain urine from the bladder into a drainage pouch.\n                \nTURP. With TURP, a urologist inserts a resectoscope through the urethra to reach the prostate and cuts pieces of enlarged prostate tissue with a wire loop. Special fluid carries the tissue pieces into the bladder, and the urologist flushes them out at the end of the procedure. TURP is the most common surgery for benign prostatic hyperplasia and considered the gold standard for treating blockage of the urethra due to benign prostatic hyperplasia.\n                \nLaser surgery. With this surgery, a urologist uses a high-energy laser to destroy prostate tissue. The urologist uses a cystoscope to pass a laser fiber through the urethra into the prostate. The laser destroys the enlarged tissue. The risk of bleeding is lower than in TURP and TUIP because the laser seals blood vessels as it cuts through the prostate tissue. However, laser surgery may not effectively treat greatly enlarged prostates.\n                \nOpen prostatectomy. In an open prostatectomy, a urologist makes an incision, or cut, through the skin to reach the prostate. The urologist can remove all or part of the prostate through the incision. This surgery is used most often when the prostate is greatly enlarged, complications occur, or the bladder is damaged and needs repair. Open prostatectomy requires general anesthesia, a longer hospital stay than other surgical procedures for benign prostatic hyperplasia, and a longer rehabilitation period. The three open prostatectomy procedures are retropubic prostatectomy, suprapubic prostatectomy, and perineal prostatectomy. The recovery period for open prostatectomy is different for each man who undergoes the procedure. However, it typically takes anywhere from 3 to 6 weeks.4\n                \nTUIP. A TUIP is a surgical procedure to widen the urethra. During a TUIP, the urologist inserts a cystoscope and an instrument that uses an electric current or a laser beam through the urethra to reach the prostate. The urologist widens the urethra by making a few small cuts in the prostate and in the bladder neck. Some urologists believe that TUIP gives the same relief as TURP except with less risk of side effects.\n                \nAfter surgery, the prostate, urethra, and surrounding tissues may be irritated and swollen, causing urinary retention. To prevent urinary retention, a urologist inserts a Foley catheter so urine can drain freely out of the bladder. A Foley catheter has a balloon on the end that the urologist inserts into the bladder. Once the balloon is inside the bladder, the urologist fills it with sterile water to keep the catheter in place. Men who undergo minimally invasive procedures may not need a Foley catheter.\n                \nThe Foley catheter most often remains in place for several days. Sometimes, the Foley catheter causes recurring, painful, difficult-to-control bladder spasms the day after surgery. However, these spasms will eventually stop. A urologist may prescribe medications to relax bladder muscles and prevent bladder spasms. These medications include\n                \n- oxybutynin chloride (Ditropan)  - solifenacin (VESIcare)  - darifenacin (Enablex)  - tolterodine (Detrol)  - hyoscyamine (Levsin)  - propantheline bromide (Pro-Banthine)",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "There are several treatment options for Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH), including:\n\n1. Medications: There are two types of medications used to treat BPH - alpha blockers and 5-alpha reductase inhibitors. Alpha blockers relax the muscles around the prostate and bladder neck, making it easier to urinate. 5-alpha reductase inhibitors shrink the prostate by preventing the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, a hormone that stimulates prostate growth.\n2. Minimally Invasive Procedures: These procedures are usually recommended when medications are not effective. They include transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), transurethral microwave thermotherapy (TUMT), transurethral needle ablation (TUNA), and laser therapy.\n3. Surgery: Surgery is usually recommended when other treatments are not effective. The most common surgery for BPH is TURP. Other surgical options include simple prostatectomy, laser surgery, and open prostatectomy.\n4. Lifestyle Changes: Lifestyle changes such as reducing fluid intake before bedtime, avoiding caffeine and alcohol, and practicing pelvic floor exercises can help alleviate symptoms of BPH.\n\nIt's important to discuss these options with your doctor to determine the best treatment plan for you.",
        "original_answer": "The complications of benign prostatic hyperplasia treatment depend on the type of treatment.\n                \nMedications\n                \nMedications used to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia may have side effects that sometimes can be serious. Men who are prescribed medications to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia should discuss possible side effects with a health care provider before taking the medications. Men who experience the following side effects should contact a health care provider right away or get emergency medical care:\n                \n- hives  - rash  - itching  - shortness of breath  - rapid, pounding, or irregular heartbeat  - painful erection of the penis that lasts for hours  - swelling of the eyes, face, tongue, lips, throat, arms, hands, feet, ankles, or lower legs  - difficulty breathing or swallowing  - chest pain  - dizziness or fainting when standing up suddenly  - sudden decrease or loss of vision  - blurred vision  - sudden decrease or loss of hearing  - chest pain, dizziness, or nausea during sexual activity\n                \nThese side effects are mostly related to phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors. Side effects related to alpha blockers include\n                \n- dizziness or fainting when standing up suddenly  - decreased sexual drive  - problems with ejaculation\n                \nMinimally Invasive Procedures\n                \nComplications after minimally invasive procedures may include\n                \n- UTIs  - painful urination  - difficulty urinating  - an urgent or a frequent need to urinate  - urinary incontinence  - blood in the urine for several days after the procedure  - sexual dysfunction  - chronic prostatitislong-lasting inflammation of the prostate  - recurring problems such as urinary retention and UTIs\n                \nMost of the complications of minimally invasive procedures go away within a few days or weeks. Minimally invasive procedures are less likely to have complications than surgery.\n                \nSurgery\n                \nComplications after surgery may include\n                \n- problems urinating  - urinary incontinence  - bleeding and blood clots  - infection  - scar tissue  - sexual dysfunction  - recurring problems such as urinary retention and UTIs\n                \nProblems urinating. Men may initially have painful urination or difficulty urinating. They may experience urinary frequency, urgency, or retention. These problems will gradually lessen and, after a couple of months, urination will be easier and less frequent.\n                \nUrinary incontinence. As the bladder returns to normal, men may have some temporary problems controlling urination. However, long-term urinary incontinence rarely occurs. The longer urinary problems existed before surgery, the longer it takes for the bladder to regain its full function after surgery.\n                \nBleeding and blood clots. After benign prostatic hyperplasia surgery, the prostate or tissues around it may bleed. Blood or blood clots may appear in urine. Some bleeding is normal and should clear up within several days. However, men should contact a health care provider right away if\n                \n- they experience pain or discomfort  - their urine contains large clots  - their urine is so red it is difficult to see through\n                \nBlood clots from benign prostatic hyperplasia surgery can pass into the bloodstream and lodge in other parts of the bodymost often the legs. Men should contact a health care provider right away if they experience swelling or discomfort in their legs.\n                \nInfection. Use of a Foley catheter after benign prostatic hyperplasia surgery may increase the risk of a UTI. Anesthesia during surgery may cause urinary retention and also increase the risk of a UTI. In addition, the incision site of an open prostatectomy may become infected. A health care provider will prescribe antibiotics to treat infections.\n                \nScar tissue. In the year after the original surgery, scar tissue sometimes forms and requires surgical treatment. Scar tissue may form in the urethra and cause it to narrow. A urologist can solve this problem during an office visit by stretching the urethra. Rarely, the opening of the bladder becomes scarred and shrinks, causing blockage. This problem may require a surgical procedure similar to TUIP.\n                \nSexual dysfunction. Some men may experience temporary problems with sexual function after benign prostatic hyperplasia surgery. The length of time for restored sexual function depends on the type of benign prostatic hyperplasia surgery performed and how long symptoms were present before surgery. Many men have found that concerns about sexual function can interfere with sex as much as the benign prostatic hyperplasia surgery itself. Understanding the surgical procedure and talking about concerns with a health care provider before surgery often help men regain sexual function earlier. Many men find it helpful to talk with a counselor during the adjustment period after surgery. Even though it can take a while for sexual function to fully return, with time, most men can enjoy sex again.\n                \nMost health care providers agree that if men with benign prostatic hyperplasia were able to maintain an erection before surgery, they will probably be able to have erections afterward. Surgery rarely causes a loss of erectile function. However, benign prostatic hyperplasia surgery most often cannot restore function that was lost before the procedure. Some men find a slight difference in the quality of orgasm after surgery. However, most report no difference.\n                \nProstate surgery may make men sterile, or unable to father children, by causing retrograde ejaculationthe backward flow of semen into the bladder. Men flush the semen out of the bladder when they urinate. In some cases, medications such as pseudoephedrine, found in many cold medications, or imipramine can treat retrograde ejaculation. These medications improve muscle tone at the bladder neck and keep semen from entering the bladder.\n                \nRecurring problems. Men may require further treatment if prostate problems, including benign prostatic hyperplasia, return. Problems may arise when treatments for benign prostatic hyperplasia leave a good part of the prostate intact. About 10 percent of men treated with TURP or TUIP require additional surgery within 5 years. About 2 percent of men who have an open prostatectomy require additional surgery within 5 years.2\n                \nIn the years after benign prostatic hyperplasia surgery or treatment, men should continue having a digital rectal exam once a year and have any symptoms checked by a health care provider. In some cases, the health care provider may recommend a digital rectal exam and checkup more than once a year.",

        "original_answer": "Talking about bladder control problems is not easy for some people. You may feel embarrassed to tell your doctor.

Make a list of the medicines you are taking. Include prescription medicines and those you buy over the counter, like aspirin or antacid. List the fluids you drink regularly, including sodas, coffee, tea, and alcohol. Tell the doctor how much of each drink you have in an average day.\n                \nFinding a Doctor\n                \nYou will need to find a doctor who is skilled in helping women with urine leakage. If your primary doctor shrugs off your problem as normal aging, for example, ask for a referral to a specialist-a urogynecologist or a urologist who specializes in treating female urinary problems. You may need to be persistent, or you may need to look to organizations to help locate a doctor in your area. See For More Information for a list of organizations.\n                \nMake a note of any recent surgeries or illnesses you have had. Let the doctor know how many children you have had. These events may or may not be related to your bladder control problem.\n                \nFinally, keep track of the times when you have urine leakage. Note what you were doing at the time. Were you coughing, laughing, sneezing, or exercising? Did you have an uncontrollable urge to urinate when you heard running water?\n                \nYou can use What Your Doctor Needs to Know (Item A) and Your Daily Bladder Diary (Item B) to prepare for your appointment.\n                \nPhysical Exam\n                \nThe doctor will give you a physical exam to look for any health issues that may be causing your bladder control problem. Checking your reflexes can show possible nerve damage. You will give a urine sample so the doctor can check for a urinary tract infection. For women, the exam may include a pelvic exam. Tests may also include taking an ultrasound picture of your bladder. Or the doctor may examine the inside of your bladder using a cystoscope, a long, thin tube that slides up into the bladder through the urethra.\n                \nBladder Function Tests\n                \nAny medical test can be uncomfortable. Bladder testing may sound embarrassing, but the health professionals who perform the tests will try to make you feel comfortable and give you as much privacy as possible.",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Bladder control issues in women can be treated with a variety of methods, including:\n\n1. Behavioral techniques: These include pelvic floor exercises (Kegels), bladder training, and scheduling bathroom breaks.\n2. Medical devices: Devices such as a pessary can be used to support the bladder and urethra.\n3. Medications: There are several types of medications that can be prescribed to treat bladder control issues, including anticholinergics, mirabegron, and alpha-blockers.\n4. Surgery: In some cases, surgery may be necessary to treat bladder control issues. This may include procedures to correct bladder prolapse or to increase bladder capacity.\n5. Nerve stimulation: In some cases, nerve stimulation may be recommended to treat bladder control issues. This can be done through a procedure called sacral neuromodulation.\n6. Lifestyle changes: Making lifestyle changes such as losing weight, quitting smoking, and avoiding caffeine and alcohol can also help improve bladder control.\n\nIt is important to consult with a healthcare provider to determine the best course of treatment for bladder control issues, as the appropriate treatment will depend on the underlying cause of the problem.",
        "original_answer": "Your doctor will likely offer several treatment choices. Some treatments are as simple as changing some daily habits. Other treatments require taking medicine or using a device. If nothing else seems to work, surgery may help a woman with stress incontinence regain her bladder control.\n                \nTalk with your doctor about which treatments might work best for you.\n                \nPelvic Muscle Strengthening\n                \nMany women prefer to try the simplest treatment choices first. Kegel exercises strengthen the pelvic muscles and don't require any equipment. Once you learn how to \"Kegel,\" you can Kegel anywhere. The trick is finding the right muscles to squeeze. Your doctor or nurse can help make sure you are squeezing the right muscles. Your doctor may refer you to a specially trained physical therapist who will teach you to find and strengthen the sphincter muscles. Learning when to squeeze these muscles can also help stop the bladder spasms that cause urge incontinence. After about 6 to 8 weeks, you should notice that you have fewer leaks and more bladder control. Use the pelvic muscle exercise log included with the Kegel Exercise Tips sheet (Item C) to keep track of your progress.\n                \nChanging Habits\n                \nTimed voiding. By keeping track of the times you leak urine, you may notice certain times of day when you are most likely to have an accident. You can use that information to make planned trips to the bathroom ahead of time to avoid the accident. Once you have established a safe pattern, you can build your bladder control by stretching out the time between trips to the bathroom. By forcing your pelvic muscles to hold on longer, you make those muscles stronger.\n                \nDiet changes. You may notice that certain foods and drinks cause you to urinate more often. You may find that avoiding caffeinated drinks like coffee, tea, or cola helps your bladder control. You can choose the decaf version of your favorite drink. Make sure you are not drinking too much fluid because that will cause you to make a large amount of urine. If you are bothered by nighttime urination, drink most of your fluids during the day and limit your drinking after dinner. You should not, however, avoid drinking fluids for fear of having an accident. Some foods may irritate your bladder and cause urgency. Talk with your doctor about diet changes that might affect your bladder.\n                \nWeight loss. Extra body weight puts extra pressure on your bladder. By losing weight, you may be able to relieve some of that pressure and regain your bladder control.\n                \nMedicines\n                \nNo medications are approved to treat stress urinary incontinence. But if you have an overactive bladder, your doctor may prescribe a medicine that can calm muscles and nerves. Medicines for overactive bladder come as pills, liquid, or a patch.\n                \nMedicines to treat overactive bladder can cause your eyes to become dry. These medicines can also cause dry mouth and constipation. If you take medicine to treat an overactive bladder, you may need to take steps to deal with the side effects.\n                \n- Use eye drops to keep your eyes moist.  - Chew gum or suck on hard candy if dry mouth bothers you. Make it sugarless gum or candy to avoid tooth decay.  - Take small sips of water throughout the day.\n                \nMedicines for other conditions also can affect the nerves and muscles of the urinary tract in different ways. Pills to treat swelling-edema-or high blood pressure may increase urine output and contribute to bladder control problems.\n                \nTalk with your doctor; you may find that taking a different medicine solves the problem without adding another prescription. The list of Medicines for Bladder Control (Item D) will give you more information about specific medicines.\n                \nPessaries\n                \nA pessary is a plastic ring, similar to a contraceptive diaphragm, that is worn in the vagina. It will help support the walls of the vagina, lifting the bladder and nearby urethra, leading to less stress leakage. A doctor or nurse can fit you with the best shape and size pessary for you and teach you how to care for it. Many women use a pessary only during exercise while others wear their pessary all day to reduce stress leakage. If you use a pessary, you should see your doctor regularly to check for small scrapes in the vagina that can result from using the device.\n                \nNerve Stimulation\n                \nElectrical stimulation of the nerves that control the bladder can improve symptoms of urgency, frequency, and urge incontinence, as well as bladder emptying problems, in some people. This treatment is usually offered to patients who cannot tolerate or do not benefit from medications. At first, your doctor will use a device outside your body to deliver stimulation through a wire implanted under your skin to see if the treatment relieves your symptoms. If the temporary treatment works well for you, you may be able to have a permanent device implanted that delivers stimulation to the nerves in your back, much like a pacemaker. The electrodes in the permanent device are placed in your lower back through a minor surgical procedure. You may need to return to the doctor for adjustments to find the right setting that controls your bladder symptoms.\n                \nSurgery\n                \nDoctors may suggest surgery to improve bladder control if other treatments have failed. Surgery helps only stress incontinence. It won't work for urge incontinence. Many surgical options have high rates of success.\n                \nMost stress incontinence problems are caused by the bladder neck dropping toward the vagina. To correct this problem, the surgeon raises the bladder neck or urethra and supports it with a ribbon-like sling or web of strings attached to a muscle or bone. The sling holds up the bottom of the bladder and the top of the urethra to stop leakage.\n                \nCatheterization\n                \nIf your bladder does not empty well as a result of nerve damage, you might leak urine. This condition is called overflow incontinence. You might use a catheter to empty your bladder. A catheter is a thin tube you can learn to insert through the urethra into the bladder to drain urine. You may use a catheter once in a while, a few times a day, or all of the time. If you use the catheter all the time, it will drain urine from your bladder into a bag you can hang from your leg. If you use a catheter all the time, you should watch for possible infections.",

        "original_answer": "Diabetes is a disorder of metabolismthe way our bodies use digested food for energy. Most of the food we eat is broken down into glucose, the form of sugar in the blood. Glucose is the body's main source of fuel.\n                \nAfter digestion, glucose enters the bloodstream. Then glucose goes to cells throughout the body where it is used for energy. However, a hormone called insulin must be present to allow glucose to enter the cells. Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas, a large gland behind the stomach.\n                \nIn people who do not have diabetes, the pancreas automatically produces the right amount of insulin to move glucose from blood into the cells. However, diabetes develops when the pancreas does not make enough insulin, or the cells in the muscles, liver, and fat do not use insulin properly, or both. As a result, the amount of glucose in the blood increases while the cells are starved of energy.\n                \nOver time, high blood glucose levels damage nerves and blood vessels, leading to complications such as heart disease and stroke, the leading causes of death among people with diabetes. Uncontrolled diabetes can eventually lead to other health problems as well, such as vision loss, kidney failure, and amputations.",

        "original_answer": "Diabetes itself is a risk factor for heart disease and stroke. Also, many people with diabetes have other conditions that increase their chance of developing heart disease and stroke. These conditions are called risk factors. One risk factor for heart disease and stroke is having a family history of heart disease. If one or more members of your family had a heart attack at an early age (before age 55 for men or 65 for women), you may be at increased risk.\n                \nYou can't change whether heart disease runs in your family, but you can take steps to control the other risk factors for heart disease listed here:\n                \n- Having central obesity. Central obesity means carrying extra weight around the waist, as opposed to the hips. A waist measurement of more than 40 inches for men and more than 35 inches for women means you have central obesity. Your risk of heart disease is higher because abdominal fat can increase the production of LDL (bad) cholesterol, the type of blood fat that can be deposited on the inside of blood vessel walls.  - Having abnormal blood fat (cholesterol) levels.      - LDL cholesterol can build up inside your blood vessels, leading to narrowing and hardening of your arteriesthe blood vessels that carry blood from the heart to the rest of the body. Arteries can then become blocked. Therefore, high levels of LDL cholesterol raise your risk of getting heart disease.    - Triglycerides are another type of blood fat that can raise your risk of heart disease when the levels are high.    - HDL (good) cholesterol removes deposits from inside your blood vessels and takes them to the liver for removal. Low levels of HDL cholesterol increase your risk for heart disease.    - Having high blood pressure. If you have high blood pressure, also called hypertension, your heart must work harder to pump blood. High blood pressure can strain the heart, damage blood vessels, and increase your risk of heart attack, stroke, eye problems, and kidney problems.  - Smoking. Smoking doubles your risk of getting heart disease. Stopping smoking is especially important for people with diabetes because both smoking and diabetes narrow blood vessels. Smoking also increases the risk of other long-term complications, such as eye problems. In addition, smoking can damage the blood vessels in your legs and increase the risk of amputation.",

        "original_answer": "Even if you are at high risk for heart disease and stroke, you can help keep your heart and blood vessels healthy. You can do so by taking the following steps:\n                \n- Make sure that your diet is \"heart-healthy.\" Meet with a registered dietitian to plan a diet that meets these goals:      - Include at least 14 grams of fiber daily for every 1,000 calories consumed. Foods high in fiber may help lower blood cholesterol. Oat bran, oatmeal, whole-grain breads and cereals, dried beans and peas (such as kidney beans, pinto beans, and black-eyed peas), fruits, and vegetables are all good sources of fiber. Increase the amount of fiber in your diet gradually to avoid digestive problems.    - Cut down on saturated fat. It raises your blood cholesterol level. Saturated fat is found in meats, poultry skin, butter, dairy products with fat, shortening, lard, and tropical oils such as palm and coconut oil. Your dietitian can figure out how many grams of saturated fat should be your daily maximum amount.    - Keep the cholesterol in your diet to less than 300 milligrams a day. Cholesterol is found in meat, dairy products, and eggs.    - Keep the amount of trans fat in your diet to a minimum. It's a type of fat in foods that raises blood cholesterol. Limit your intake of crackers, cookies, snack foods, commercially prepared baked goods, cake mixes, microwave popcorn, fried foods, salad dressings, and other foods made with partially hydrogenated oil. In addition, some kinds of vegetable shortening and margarines have trans fat. Check for trans fat in the Nutrition Facts section on the food package.    - If you smoke, quit. Your doctor can help you find ways to quit smoking.  - Ask your doctor whether you should take aspirin. Studies have shown that taking a low dose of aspirin every day can help reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke. However, aspirin is not safe for everyone. Your doctor can tell you whether taking aspirin is right for you and exactly how much to take.  - Get prompt treatment for transient ischemic attacks (TIAs). Early treatment for TIAs, sometimes called mini-strokes, may help prevent or delay a future stroke. Signs of a TIA are sudden weakness, loss of balance, numbness, confusion, blindness in one or both eyes, double vision, difficulty speaking, or a severe headache.",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Diabetes is a chronic condition where the body cannot properly process sugar, leading to high blood sugar levels. Over time, this can damage various organs and lead to complications such as heart disease and stroke.\n\nHeart disease refers to a range of conditions that affect the heart and blood vessels, including coronary artery disease, heart failure, and arrhythmias. These conditions can lead to heart attacks, heart failure, and other serious complications.\n\nA stroke occurs when the blood supply to a part of the brain is interrupted or reduced, often due to a blood clot or a burst blood vessel. This can cause brain cells to die, leading to a range of symptoms such as weakness, numbness, and difficulty speaking or understanding speech. Both heart disease and stroke are often linked to high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and other lifestyle factors.",
        "original_answer": "Two major types of heart and blood vessel disease, also called cardiovascular disease, are common in people with diabetes: coronary artery disease (CAD) and cerebral vascular disease. People with diabetes are also at risk for heart failure. Narrowing or blockage of the blood vessels in the legs, a condition called peripheral arterial disease, can also occur in people with diabetes.\n                \nCoronary Artery Disease\n                \nCoronary artery disease, also called ischemic heart disease, is caused by a hardening or thickening of the walls of the blood vessels that go to your heart. Your blood supplies oxygen and other materials your heart needs for normal functioning. If the blood vessels to your heart become narrowed or blocked by fatty deposits, the blood supply is reduced or cut off, resulting in a heart attack.\n                \nCerebral Vascular Disease\n                \nCerebral vascular disease affects blood flow to the brain, leading to strokes and TIAs. It is caused by narrowing, blocking, or hardening of the blood vessels that go to the brain or by high blood pressure.\n                \nStroke\n                \nA stroke results when the blood supply to the brain is suddenly cut off, which can occur when a blood vessel in the brain or neck is blocked or bursts. Brain cells are then deprived of oxygen and die. A stroke can result in problems with speech or vision or can cause weakness or paralysis. Most strokes are caused by fatty deposits or blood clotsjelly-like clumps of blood cellsthat narrow or block one of the blood vessels in the brain or neck. A blood clot may stay where it formed or can travel within the body. People with diabetes are at increased risk for strokes caused by blood clots.\n                \nA stroke may also be caused by a bleeding blood vessel in the brain. Called an aneurysm, a break in a blood vessel can occur as a result of high blood pressure or a weak spot in a blood vessel wall.\n                \nTIAs\n                \nTIAs are caused by a temporary blockage of a blood vessel to the brain. This blockage leads to a brief, sudden change in brain function, such as temporary numbness or weakness on one side of the body. Sudden changes in brain function also can lead to loss of balance, confusion, blindness in one or both eyes, double vision, difficulty speaking, or a severe headache. However, most symptoms disappear quickly and permanent damage is unlikely. If symptoms do not resolve in a few minutes, rather than a TIA, the event could be a stroke. The occurrence of a TIA means that a person is at risk for a stroke sometime in the future. See page 3 for more information on risk factors for stroke.\n                \nHeart Failure\n                \nHeart failure is a chronic condition in which the heart cannot pump blood properlyit does not mean that the heart suddenly stops working. Heart failure develops over a period of years, and symptoms can get worse over time. People with diabetes have at least twice the risk of heart failure as other people. One type of heart failure is congestive heart failure, in which fluid builds up inside body tissues. If the buildup is in the lungs, breathing becomes difficult.\n                \nBlockage of the blood vessels and high blood glucose levels also can damage heart muscle and cause irregular heart beats. People with damage to heart muscle, a condition called cardiomyopathy, may have no symptoms in the early stages, but later they may experience weakness, shortness of breath, a severe cough, fatigue, and swelling of the legs and feet. Diabetes can also interfere with pain signals normally carried by the nerves, explaining why a person with diabetes may not experience the typical warning signs of a heart attack.\n                \nPeripheral Arterial Disease\n                \nAnother condition related to heart disease and common in people with diabetes is peripheral arterial disease (PAD). With this condition, the blood vessels in the legs are narrowed or blocked by fatty deposits, decreasing blood flow to the legs and feet. PAD increases the chances of a heart attack or stroke occurring. Poor circulation in the legs and feet also raises the risk of amputation. Sometimes people with PAD develop pain in the calf or other parts of the leg when walking, which is relieved by resting for a few minutes.",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Hemochromatosis is a medical condition where the body absorbs too much iron from food, leading to iron overload. This can cause damage to various organs, such as the liver, heart, and pancreas. There are two main types: hereditary (genetic) and acquired. Hereditary hemochromatosis is caused by genetic mutations, while acquired hemochromatosis can be caused by certain anemias, alcoholism, or chronic liver disease. Symptoms may include fatigue, joint pain, and abdominal pain. Treatment typically involves regular phlebotomy (blood removal) to reduce iron levels in the body.",
        "original_answer": "Hemochromatosis is the most common form of iron overload disease. Too much iron in the body causes hemochromatosis. Iron is important because it is part of hemoglobin, a molecule in the blood that transports oxygen from the lungs to all body tissues. However, too much iron in the body leads to iron overloada buildup of extra iron that, without treatment, can damage organs such as the liver, heart, and pancreas; endocrine glands; and joints.\n                \nThe three types of hemochromatosis are primary hemochromatosis, also called hereditary hemochromatosis; secondary hemochromatosis; and neonatal hemochromatosis.",

There are two main types of hemochromatosis: hereditary and secondary.\n\nHereditary hemochromatosis is caused by inheriting mutations in genes that control how much iron the body absorbs. The most common type is caused by mutations in the HFE gene.\n\nSecondary hemochromatosis, on the other hand, is not inherited and is caused by other conditions such as chronic liver disease, anemia, or alcoholism, which can lead to increased iron absorption.\n\nIt is important to note that both types of hemochromatosis can lead to serious health problems if left untreated, such as liver damage, heart problems, and diabetes. If you suspect you may have hemochromatosis, it is important to speak with a healthcare professional for further evaluation and treatment.",
        "original_answer": "Primary Hemochromatosis\n                \nInherited genetic defects cause primary hemochromatosis, and mutations in the HFE gene are associated with up to 90 percent of cases.1 The HFE gene helps regulate the amount of iron absorbed from food. The two known mutations of HFE are C282Y and H63D. C282Y defects are the most common cause of primary hemochromatosis.\n                \nPeople inherit two copies of the HFE geneone copy from each parent. Most people who inherit two copies of the HFE gene with the C282Y defect will have higher-than-average iron absorption. However, not all of these people will develop health problems associated with hemochromatosis. One recent study found that 31 percent of people with two copies of the C282Y defect developed health problems by their early fifties.2 Men who develop health problems from HFE defects typically develop them after age 40.1 Women who develop health problems from HFE defects typically develop them after menopause.1\n                \nPeople who inherit two H63D defects or one C282Y and one H63D defect may have higher-than-average iron absorption.3 However, they are unlikely to develop iron overload and organ damage.\n                \nRare defects in other genes may also cause primary hemochromatosis. Mutations in the hemojuvelin or hepcidin genes cause juvenile hemochromatosis, a type of primary hemochromatosis. People with juvenile hemochromatosis typically develop severe iron overload and liver and heart damage between ages 15 and 30.\n                \nSecondary Hemochromatosis\n                \nHemochromatosis that is not inherited is called secondary hemochromatosis. The most common cause of secondary hemochromatosis is frequent blood transfusions in people with severe anemia. Anemia is a condition in which red blood cells are fewer or smaller than normal, which means they carry less oxygen to the bodys cells. Types of anemia that may require frequent blood transfusions include\n                \n- congenital, or inherited, anemias such as sickle cell disease, thalassemia, and Fanconis syndrome  - severe acquired anemias, which are not inherited, such as aplastic anemia and autoimmune hemolytic anemia\n                \nLiver diseasessuch as alcoholic liver disease, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, and chronic hepatitis C infectionmay cause mild iron overload. However, this iron overload causes much less liver damage than the underlying liver disease causes.\n                \nNeonatal Hemochromatosis\n                \nNeonatal hemochromatosis is a rare disease characterized by liver failure and death in fetuses and newborns. Researchers are studying the causes of neonatal hemochromatosis and believe more than one factor may lead to the disease.\n                \nExperts previously considered neonatal hemochromatosis a type of primary hemochromatosis. However, recent studies suggest genetic defects that increase iron absorption do not cause this disease. Instead, the mothers immune system may produce antibodiesproteins made by the immune system to protect the body from foreign substances such as bacteria or virusesthat damage the liver of the fetus. Women who have had one child with neonatal hemochromatosis are at risk for having more children with the disease.4 Treating these women during pregnancy with intravenous (IV) immunoglobulina solution of antibodies from healthy peoplecan prevent fetal liver damage.4\n                \nResearchers supported by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) recently found that a combination of exchange transfusionremoving blood and replacing it with donor bloodand IV immunoglobulin is an effective treatment for babies born with neonatal hemochromatosis.5",

After taking a medical history, a health care provider will perform a physical exam, which may help diagnose hemochromatosis. During a physical exam, a health care provider usually      - examines a patients body    - uses a stethoscope to listen to bodily sounds    - taps on specific areas of the patients body      - Blood tests. A blood test involves drawing blood at a health care providers office or a commercial facility and sending the sample to a lab for analysis. Blood tests can determine whether the amount of iron stored in the body is higher than normal:1      - The transferrin saturation test shows how much iron is bound to the protein that carries iron in the blood. Transferrin saturation values above or equal to 45 percent are considered abnormal.    - The serum ferritin test detects the amount of ferritina protein that stores ironin the blood. Levels above 300 g/L in men and 200 g/L in women are considered abnormal. Levels above 1,000 g/L in men or women indicate a high chance of iron overload and organ damage.    If either test shows higher-than-average levels of iron in the body, health care providers can order a special blood test that can detect two copies of the C282Y mutation to confirm the diagnosis. If the mutation is not present, health care providers will look for other causes.    - Liver biopsy. Health care providers may perform a liver biopsy, a procedure that involves taking a piece of liver tissue for examination with a microscope for signs of damage or disease. The health care provider may ask the patient to temporarily stop taking certain medications before the liver biopsy. The health care provider may ask the patient to fast for 8 hours before the procedure.  During the procedure, the patient lies on a table, right hand resting above the head. The health care provider applies a local anesthetic to the area where he or she will insert the biopsy needle. If needed, a health care provider will also give sedatives and pain medication. The health care provider uses a needle to take a small piece of liver tissue. He or she may use ultrasound, computerized tomography scans, or other imaging techniques to guide the needle. After the biopsy, the patient must lie on the right side for up to 2 hours and is monitored an additional 2 to 4 hours before being sent home.  A health care provider performs a liver biopsy at a hospital or an outpatient center. The health care provider sends the liver sample to a pathology lab where the pathologista doctor who specializes in diagnosing diseaselooks at the tissue with a microscope and sends a report to the patients health care provider. The biopsy shows how much iron has accumulated in the liver and whether the patient has liver damage.\n                \nHemochromatosis is rare, and health care providers may not think to test for this disease. Thus, the disease is often not diagnosed or treated. The initial symptoms can be diverse, vague, and similar to the symptoms of many other diseases. Health care providers may focus on the symptoms and complications caused by hemochromatosis rather than on the underlying iron overload. However, if a health care provider diagnoses and treats the iron overload caused by hemochromatosis before organ damage has occurred, a person can live a normal, healthy life.\n                \n\n                \nWho should be tested for hemochromatosis?   Experts recommend testing for hemochromatosis in people who have symptoms, complications, or a family history of the disease.   Some researchers have suggested widespread screening for the C282Y mutation in the general population. However, screening is not cost-effective. Although the C282Y mutation occurs quite frequently, the disease caused by the mutation is rare, and many people with two copies of the mutation never develop iron overload or organ damage.   Researchers and public health officials suggest the following:   - Siblings of people who have hemochromatosis should have their blood tested to see if they have the C282Y mutation.   - Parents, children, and other close relatives of people who have hemochromatosis should consider being tested.   - Health care providers should consider testing people who have severe and continuing fatigue, unexplained cirrhosis, joint pain or arthritis, heart problems, erectile dysfunction, or diabetes because these health issues may result from hemochromatosis.",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Hemochromatosis is a condition where the body absorbs too much iron from food, leading to iron overload. The treatments include:\n\n1. Phlebotomy: This is the most common treatment, where blood is regularly removed to reduce iron levels in the body.\n\n2. Chelation Therapy: This is a treatment where a medication is given to bind with the excess iron and remove it from the body through urine or stool.\n\n3. Dietary modifications: Avoiding iron-rich foods and alcohol can help manage iron levels.\n\n4. Medications: Certain medications that reduce iron absorption in the gut may be prescribed.\n\n5. Regular monitoring: Regular testing to monitor iron levels is crucial to manage the condition effectively.\n\nRemember, it's important to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized treatment.",
        "original_answer": "Health care providers treat hemochromatosis by drawing blood. This process is called phlebotomy. Phlebotomy rids the body of extra iron. This treatment is simple, inexpensive, and safe.\n                \nBased on the severity of the iron overload, a patient will have phlebotomy to remove a pint of blood once or twice a week for several months to a year, and occasionally longer. Health care providers will test serum ferritin levels periodically to monitor iron levels. The goal is to bring serum ferritin levels to the low end of the average range and keep them there. Depending on the lab, the level is 25 to 50 g/L.\n                \nAfter phlebotomy reduces serum ferritin levels to the desired level, patients may need maintenance phlebotomy treatment every few months. Some patients may need phlebotomies more often. Serum ferritin tests every 6 months or once a year will help determine how often a patient should have blood drawn. Many blood donation centers provide free phlebotomy treatment for people with hemochromatosis.\n                \nTreating hemochromatosis before organs are damaged can prevent complications such as cirrhosis, heart problems, arthritis, and diabetes. Treatment cannot cure these conditions in patients who already have them at diagnosis. However, treatment will help most of these conditions improve. The treatments effectiveness depends on the degree of organ damage. For example, treating hemochromatosis can stop the progression of liver damage in its early stages and lead to a normal life expectancy. However, if a patient develops cirrhosis, his or her chance of developing liver cancer increases, even with phlebotomy treatment. Arthritis usually does not improve even after phlebotomy removes extra iron.",

        "original_answer": "The kidneys are two bean-shaped organs, each about the size of a fist. They are located just below the rib cage, one on each side of the spine. Every day, the two kidneys filter about 120 to 150 quarts of blood to produce about 1 to 2 quarts of urine, composed of wastes and extra fluid. Children produce less urine than adults and the amount produced depends on their age. The urine flows from the kidneys to the bladder through tubes called ureters. The bladder stores urine. When the bladder empties, urine flows out of the body through a tube called the urethra, located at the bottom of the bladder.",

        "original_answer": "Researchers have found that many factors cause growth failure in children with CKD. In addition to removing wastes and extra fluid from the blood, the kidneys perform important functions for a childs growth. Understanding normal kidney function and growth helps families understand what causes growth failure in children with CKD.\n                \nNormal kidney function helps maintain the\n                \n- balance of nutrients and minerals, such as calcium and phosphorus, in the blood. These minerals are essential for normal bone growth. The kidneys use a hormone called calcitriol, a form of vitamin D, to help bones absorb the right amount of calcium from the blood. The kidneys also remove extra phosphorus, helping balance phosphorus and calcium levels in the blood.  - bodys ability to use growth hormone. Growth hormone is necessary during childhood to help bones grow and stay healthy. The pituitary gland naturally produces growth hormone, which acts as a messenger to help the body grow. Growth hormone tells the liver to produce another hormone, called insulin-like growth factor, that travels to muscles, organs, and bones and tells them to grow.  - correct levels of erythropoietin in the body. Erythropoietin is a hormone that helps bone marrow make red blood cells.  - proper balance of sodium, also called salt; potassium; and acid-base levels in the blood. Acid-base balance refers to the amount of acid in the blood.\n                \nDamaged kidneys can slow a childs growth by\n                \n- causing mineral and bone disorder, which occurs when      - vitamin D is not turned into calcitriol, which starves the bones of calcium.    - phosphorus levels rise in the blood and draw calcium out of the bones and into the blood, causing the bones to weaken.    - creating an imbalance of sodium, potassium, and acid-base levels in the blood, also called acidosis. When blood is not balanced, the body slows growth to focus energy on restoring the balance.  - decreasing appetite. A child with CKD may not be hungry, or he or she may not have the energy to eat, which may lead to poor nutrition and slower growth.  - decreasing the production of erythropoietin. When erythropoietin levels are low, a child may develop anemiaa condition that develops when the blood does not have enough healthy red blood cells to carry oxygen to cells throughout the body. Anemia can cause growth to slow or stop.  - making an abnormally large amount of urine, called polyuria, which disrupts the bodys fluid balance. A child with polyuria loses minerals as well. The body slows growth to make up for the lost fluid and minerals.  - preventing the body from correctly using growth hormone. When the kidneys are damaged, waste builds up in the blood and the body does not properly process growth hormone.",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Treatment for growth failure in children with chronic kidney disease (CKD) often involves a combination of methods to address the underlying causes, which can include poor nutrition, hormonal imbalances, and kidney dysfunction. Here are some common approaches:\n\n1. **Nutrition Management:** A well-balanced, high-protein, high-calorie diet can help promote growth. In some cases, nutritional supplements or specialized formulas may be recommended.\n\n2. **Hormone Therapy:** Children with CKD often have growth hormone deficiency. Recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) therapy can be prescribed to stimulate growth.\n\n3. **Mineral and Vitamin Supplements:** Children with CKD may have deficiencies in certain vitamins and minerals, such as vitamin D, calcium, and phosphorus. Supplements can help correct these imbalances.\n\n4. **Erythropoietin (EPO) Therapy:** Anemia is common in CKD. EPO, a hormone that stimulates red blood cell production, can be used to treat anemia, which can improve growth.\n\n5. **Medication to Control Kidney Disease:** Medicines to control high blood pressure, reduce protein loss in urine, and manage electrolyte imbalances can also support growth.\n\n6. **Dialysis or Kidney Transplant:** If CKD progresses to kidney failure, dialysis or a kidney transplant may be necessary. Both of these treatments can improve growth.\n\nRemember, each child is unique, and treatment should be individualized based on the child's specific needs and the severity of their CKD.

        "original_answer": "Children with CKD may lose their appetite or lack the energy to eat. To treat growth failure in children, a health care provider may recommend dietary changes, such as\n                \n- adding calcium. Children with CKD should get the recommended level of calcium for their age from their diet or from calcium supplements.  - monitoring liquids. Balancing the childs liquid intake based on his or her kidney disease is important. Some children will need to increase liquid intake, while other children will need to restrict liquid intake.  - limiting phosphorus. Children with CKD may need to limit phosphorus intake if they have mineral and bone disorder.  - monitoring protein. Children with CKD should eat enough protein for growth; however, they should avoid high protein intake, which can put an extra burden on the kidneys.  - monitoring sodium. The amount of sodium children with CKD need depends on the stage of their kidney disease, their age, and sometimes other factors. The health care provider may recommend either limiting or adding sodium, often from salt, to the childs diet.  - adding vitamin D. Children who do not get enough vitamin D through diet may need to take vitamin D supplements.\n                \nTo help ensure coordinated and safe care, parents and caregivers should discuss the use of complementary and alternative medical practices, including the use of dietary supplements, with the childs health care provider. Read more at www.nccam.nih.gov.\n                \nSome children will use a feeding tube to receive all their nutrition. A feeding tube is a small, soft plastic tube placed through the nose or mouth into the stomach. The child will receive supplements through the tube to provide a full supply of fluid and nutrients to help him or her grow and develop. Feeding tubes are most often used in infants; however, sometimes older children and adolescents benefit from them as well.\n                \nEncouraging children to develop healthy eating habits can help prevent poor nutrition and promote healthy growing. The health care team will work with parents or caretakers to develop a healthy diet tailored to meet the needs of their child.\n                \nMore information about diet and kidney disease is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Nutrition for Chronic Kidney Disease in Children.\n                \nMedications\n                \nA health care provider may prescribe medications that can help correct the underlying problems causing growth failure.\n                \n- A health care provider may prescribe phosphate binders when phosphorus levels in the blood rise and interfere with bone formation and normal growth. In the intestine, the medications bind, or attach, to some of the phosphorus found in food, causing the phosphorus to move through the intestine without being absorbed and exit the body in the stool. This process can decrease blood phosphorus levels and increase blood calcium levels. Phosphate binders come as chewable tablets, liquids, capsules, and pills.  - A health care provider may prescribe alkaline agents such as sodium bicarbonate to restore the acid-base balance in a child with acidosis.  - Synthetic erythropoietin is a man-made form of erythropoietin given by injection to treat anemia.\n                \nGrowth Hormone Therapy\n                \nWhen a health care provider diagnoses a child with CKD and the child begins to show signs of growth failure, the health care provider may prescribe daily human growth hormone injections.

Blood in the urine (hematuria): This is often the first sign of IgA Nephropathy. The blood may be visible or only detectable under a microscope.\n\n2. Protein in the urine (proteinuria): Over time, the kidneys may also allow larger proteins, like albumin, to leak into the urine.\n\n3. Swelling (edema): This is caused by the retention of fluids, often in the legs, ankles, and feet.\n\n4. High blood pressure (hypertension): As the condition progresses, it can lead to high blood pressure.\n\n5. Kidney failure: In severe cases, IgA Nephropathy can lead to kidney failure, which can cause symptoms such as fatigue, loss of appetite, and difficulty concentrating.\n\nRemember, only a healthcare professional can diagnose IgA Nephropathy.

        "original_answer": "In its early stages, IgA nephropathy may have no symptoms; it can be silent for years or even decades. Once symptoms appear, the most common one is hematuria, or blood in the urine. Hematuria can be a sign of damaged glomeruli. Blood in the urine may appear during or soon after a cold, sore throat, or other respiratory infection. The amount of blood may be\n                \n- visible with the naked eye. The urine may turn pink or the color of tea or cola. Sometimes a person may have dark or bloody urine.  - so small that it can only be detected using special medical tests.\n                \nAnother symptom of IgA nephropathy is albuminuriawhen a persons urine contains an increased amount of albumin, a protein typically found in the blood, or large amounts of protein in the urine. Albumin is the main protein in the blood. Healthy kidneys keep most proteins in the blood from leaking into the urine. However, when the glomeruli are damaged, large amounts of protein leak out of the blood into the urine.\n                \nWhen albumin leaks into the urine, the blood loses its capacity to absorb extra fluid from the body. Too much fluid in the body may cause edema, or swelling, usually in the legs, feet, or ankles and less often in the hands or face. Foamy urine is another sign of albuminuria. Some people with IgA nephropathy have both hematuria and albuminuria.\n                \nAfter 10 to 20 years with IgA nephropathy, about 20 to 40 percent of adults develop end-stage kidney disease.5 Signs and symptoms of end-stage kidney disease may include\n                \n- high blood pressure  - little or no urination  - edema  - feeling tired  - drowsiness  - generalized itching or numbness  - dry skin  - headaches  - weight loss  - appetite loss  - nausea  - vomiting  - sleep problems  - trouble concentrating  - darkened skin  - muscle cramps",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "IgA Nephropathy, also known as Berger's disease, is a kidney disorder that can cause inflammation in the glomeruli, the tiny filtering units in the kidneys. Treatment for IgA Nephropathy typically aims to manage symptoms, slow the progression of the disease, and prevent complications. Here are some common treatments:\n\n1. Medications: Various medications may be prescribed to reduce inflammation, control blood pressure, and protect the kidneys. These can include corticosteroids, immunosuppressive drugs, blood pressure-lowering medications, and ACE inhibitors or ARBs to protect kidney function.\n2. Blood pressure control: Keeping blood pressure under control is essential for managing IgA Nephropathy, as high blood pressure can worsen kidney damage. Your doctor may recommend lifestyle changes, such as following a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and reducing sodium intake.\n3. Reducing protein in the urine: If you have protein in your urine, your doctor may recommend a low-protein diet to reduce the workload on your kidneys.\n4. Managing other health conditions: If you have other health conditions, such as diabetes or high cholesterol, managing these conditions can help protect your kidneys.\n5. Lifestyle changes: Adopting a healthy lifestyle can help manage IgA Nephropathy and prevent complications. This can include following a healthy diet, exercising regularly, quitting smoking, and avoiding alcohol and other harmful substances.\n6. Regular monitoring: Regular monitoring of kidney function, blood pressure, and urine protein levels is essential for managing IgA Nephropathy and preventing complications.\n\nIt's important to note that the best treatment for IgA Nephropathy varies depending on the severity of the disease and individual patient factors. Your doctor will work with you to develop a personalized treatment plan based on your specific needs.",
        "original_answer": "Researchers have not yet found a specific cure for IgA nephropathy. Once the kidneys are scarred, they cannot be repaired. Therefore, the ultimate goal of IgA nephropathy treatment is to prevent or delay end-stage kidney disease. A health care provider may prescribe medications to\n                \n- control a persons blood pressure and slow the progression of kidney disease  - remove extra fluid from a persons blood  - control a persons immune system  - lower a persons blood cholesterol levels\n                \nControl Blood Pressure and Slow Progression of Kidney Disease\n                \nPeople with IgA nephropathy that is causing high blood pressure may need to take medications that lower blood pressure and can also significantly slow the progression of kidney disease. Two types of blood pressure-lowering medicationsangiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)have proven effective in slowing the progression of kidney disease. Many people require two or more medications to control their blood pressure. A person may also need beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and other blood pressure medications.\n                \nRemove Extra Fluid\n                \nA health care provider may prescribe a diuretic, a medication that helps the kidneys remove extra fluid from the blood. Removing the extra fluid can improve the control of blood pressure. Taking a diuretic along with an ACE inhibitor or an ARB often increases the effectiveness of these medications.\n                \nControl the Immune System\n                \nHealth care providers sometimes use medications to control a persons immune system. Since inflammation is the immune systems normal response, controlling the immune system can decrease inflammation. Health care providers may prescribe the following medications:\n                \n- corticosteroids, such as prednisone  - cyclophosphamide\n                \nLower Blood Cholesterol Levels\n                \nPeople with IgA nephropathy may develop high blood cholesterol levels.

Proteins break down into waste products the kidneys must filter from the blood. Eating more protein than the body needs may burden the kidneys and cause kidney function to decline faster. However, protein intake that is too low may lead to malnutrition, a condition that occurs when the body does not get enough nutrients. People with kidney disease on a restricted protein diet should receive blood tests that can show nutrient levels.\n                \nSome researchers have shown that fish oil supplements containing omega-3 fatty acids may slow kidney damage in some people with kidney disease by lowering blood pressure.

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Primary Biliary Cirrhosis (PBC) is a rare, chronic autoimmune liver disease. In PBC, the immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys the bile ducts in the liver, leading to scarring, inflammation, and eventually cirrhosis, a condition characterized by irreversible scarring and damage to the liver.\n\nThe exact cause of PBC is unknown, but it is thought to be related to genetic, environmental, and immune system factors. It primarily affects middle-aged women and can lead to symptoms such as fatigue, itching, jaundice, and abdominal pain. Treatment typically involves medications to manage symptoms and slow the progression of the disease, but in severe cases, a liver transplant may be necessary.",
        "original_answer": "Primary biliary cirrhosis is a chronic, or long lasting, disease that causes the small bile ducts in the liver to become inflamed and damaged and ultimately disappear.\n                \nThe bile ducts carry a fluid called bile from the liver to the gallbladder, where it is stored. When food enters the stomach after a meal, the gallbladder contracts, and the bile ducts carry bile to the duodenum, the first part of the small intestine, for use in digestion. The liver makes bile, which is made up of bile acids, cholesterol, fats, and fluids. Bile helps the body absorb fats, cholesterol, and fat-soluble vitamins. Bile also carries cholesterol, toxins, and waste products to the intestines, where the body removes them. When chronic inflammation, or swelling, damages the bile ducts, bile and toxic wastes build up in the liver, damaging liver tissue.\n                \nThis damage to the liver tissue can lead to cirrhosis, a condition in which the liver slowly deteriorates and is unable to function normally. In cirrhosis, scar tissue replaces healthy liver tissue, partially blocking the flow of blood through the liver.\n                \nThe liver is the bodys largest internal organ. The liver is called the bodys metabolic factory because of the important role it plays in metabolismthe way cells change food into energy after food is digested and absorbed into the blood. The liver has many functions, including\n                \n- taking up, storing, and processing nutrients from foodincluding fat, sugar, and proteinand delivering them to the rest of the body when needed  - making new proteins, such as clotting factors and immune factors  - producing bile  - removing waste products the kidneys cannot remove, such as fats, cholesterol, toxins, and medications\n                \nA healthy liver is necessary for survival. The liver can regenerate most of its own cells when they become damaged. However, if injury to the liver is too severe or long lasting, regeneration is incomplete, and the liver creates scar tissue. Scarring of the liver may lead to cirrhosis.\n                \nThe buildup of scar tissue that causes cirrhosis is usually a slow and gradual process. In the early stages of cirrhosis, the liver continues to function. However, as cirrhosis gets worse and scar tissue replaces more healthy tissue, the liver will begin to fail. Chronic liver failure, which is also called end-stage liver disease, progresses over months, years, or even decades. With end-stage liver disease, the liver can no longer perform important functions or effectively replace damaged cells.\n                \nPrimary biliary cirrhosis usually occurs between the ages of 30 and 65 and affects women more often than men.1",

If left untreated or not managed properly, PBC can lead to several complications, including:\n\n1. Cirrhosis: PBC can cause scarring of the liver, leading to cirrhosis, a condition where the liver becomes hardened and unable to function properly.\n2. Liver failure: Advanced cirrhosis can lead to liver failure, which can be life-threatening and may require a liver transplant.\n3. Esophageal varices: Scarring of the liver can lead to increased pressure in the veins that supply the liver, causing them to widen and potentially bleed. This is known as esophageal varices.\n4. Portal hypertension: Increased pressure in the portal vein, which carries blood to the liver, can lead to various complications, including esophageal varices, ascites, and encephalopathy.\n5. Ascites: Fluid accumulation in the abdomen, known as ascites, can occur due to liver dysfunction.\n6. Encephalopathy: Liver dysfunction can also lead to hepatic encephalopathy, a condition that affects brain function, causing confusion, disorientation, and in severe cases, coma.\n7.

        "original_answer": "Most complications of primary biliary cirrhosis are related to cirrhosis and start after primary biliary cirrhosis progresses to cirrhosis. In some cases, portal hypertension and esophageal varices may develop before cirrhosis.\n                \nPortal hypertension. The portal vein carries blood from the stomach, intestines, spleen, gallbladder, and pancreas to the liver. In cirrhosis, scar tissue partially blocks the normal flow of blood, which increases the pressure in the portal vein. This condition is called portal hypertension. Portal hypertension is a common complication of cirrhosis. This condition may lead to other complications, such as\n                \n- edemaswelling due to a buildup of fluidin the feet, ankles, or legs, and ascitesa buildup of fluid in the abdomen  - enlarged blood vessels, called varices, in the esophagus, stomach, or both  - an enlarged spleen, called splenomegaly  - mental confusion due to a buildup of toxins that are ordinarily removed by the liver, a condition called hepatic encephalopathy\n                \nEdema and ascites. Liver failure causes fluid buildup that results in edema and ascites. Ascites can lead to spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, a serious infection that requires immediate medical attention.\n                \nVarices. Portal hypertension may cause enlarged blood vessels in the esophagus, stomach, or both. These enlarged blood vessels, called esophageal or gastric varices, cause the vessel walls to become thin and blood pressure to increase, making the blood vessels more likely to burst. If they burst, serious bleeding can occur in the esophagus or upper stomach, requiring immediate medical attention.\n                \nSplenomegaly. Portal hypertension may cause the spleen to enlarge and retain white blood cells and platelets, reducing the numbers of these cells and platelets in the blood. A low platelet count may be the first evidence that a person has developed cirrhosis.\n                \nHepatic encephalopathy. A failing liver cannot remove toxins from the blood, so they eventually accumulate in the brain. The buildup of toxins in the brain is called hepatic encephalopathy. This condition can decrease mental function and cause stupor and even coma. Stupor is an unconscious, sleeplike state from which a person can only be aroused briefly by a strong stimulus, such as a sharp pain. Coma is an unconscious, sleeplike state from which a person cannot be aroused. Signs of decreased mental function include\n                \n- confusion  - personality changes  - memory loss  - trouble concentrating  - a change in sleep habits\n                \nMetabolic bone diseases. Some people with cirrhosis develop a metabolic bone disease, which is a disorder of bone strength usually caused by abnormalities of vitamin D, bone mass, bone structure, or minerals, such as calcium and phosphorous. Osteopenia is a condition in which the bones become less dense, making them weaker. When bone loss becomes more severe, the condition is referred to as osteoporosis. People with these conditions are more likely to develop bone fractures.\n                \nGallstones and bile duct stones. If cirrhosis prevents bile from flowing freely to and from the gallbladder, the bile hardens into gallstones. Symptoms of gallstones include abdominal pain and recurrent bacterial cholangitisirritated or infected bile ducts. Stones may also form in and block the bile ducts, causing pain, jaundice, and bacterial cholangitis.\n                \nSteatorrhea. Steatorrhea is a condition in which the body cannot absorb fat, causing a buildup of fat in the stool and loose, greasy, and foul-smelling bowel movements. Steatorrhea may be caused by impairment of bile delivery to the small intestine or by the pancreas not producing enough digestive enzymes.\n                \nLiver cancer. Liver cancer is common in people with cirrhosis. Liver cancer has a high mortality rate. Current treatments are limited and only fully successful if a health care provider detects the cancer early, before the tumor is too large. For this reason, health care providers should check people with cirrhosis for signs of liver cancer every 6 to 12 months. Health care providers use blood tests, ultrasound, or both to check for signs of liver cancer.",

Liver Biopsy: If the diagnosis is uncertain after the above tests, a liver biopsy may be done. This involves removing a small piece of liver tissue for examination under a microscope.\n\nIt's important to note that only a qualified healthcare professional can make a diagnosis. If you have symptoms that suggest PBC, you should consult with a healthcare provider.",
        "original_answer": "A health care provider may use the following tests to diagnose primary biliary cirrhosis:\n                \n- a medical and family history  - a physical exam  - blood tests  - imaging tests  - a liver biopsy\n                \nA health care provider usually bases a diagnosis of primary biliary cirrhosis on two out of three of the following criteria:\n                \n- a blood test showing elevated liver enzymes  - a blood test showing the presence of anti-mitochondrial antibodies (AMA)  - a liver biopsy showing signs of the disease\n                \nHealth care providers may order additional tests to rule out other causes of symptoms. Health care providers diagnose the majority of people with primary biliary cirrhosis early in the course of the disease.\n                \nMedical and family history. Taking a medical and family history is one of the first things a health care provider may do to help diagnose primary biliary cirrhosis. He or she will ask a patient to provide a medical and family history.\n                \nPhysical exam. A physical exam may help diagnose primary biliary cirrhosis. During a physical exam, a health care provider usually\n                \n- examines a patients body  - uses a stethoscope to listen to sounds in the abdomen  - taps on specific areas of the patients body\n                \nThe health care provider will perform a physical exam to look for signs of the disease. For example, the liver may feel hard or ascites may cause the abdomen to enlarge.\n                \nBlood test. A blood test involves drawing blood at a health care providers office or a commercial facility and sending the sample to a lab for analysis. The blood test can show elevated levels of liver enzymes, such as alkaline phosphatase. A routine blood test may show high levels of the liver enzyme alkaline phosphatase in people who have primary biliary cirrhosis and are not yet showing symptoms.\n                \nThe health care provider will perform an AMA blood test to help confirm the diagnosis. A blood test will detect the presence of AMA in 90 to 95 percent of people with primary biliary cirrhosis.3\n                \nImaging tests. A health care provider may use the following imaging tests to examine the bile ducts. These tests can distinguish between primary biliary cirrhosis and other conditions that affect the bile ducts.\n                \n- Ultrasound uses a device, called a transducer, that bounces safe, painless sound waves off organs to create an image of their structure. A specially trained technician performs the procedure in a health care providers office, an outpatient center, or a hospital, and a radiologista doctor who specializes in medical imaging interprets the images. A patient does not need anesthesia. In addition to showing problems with the bile ducts, the images can show signs of advanced cirrhosis or complications.  - Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography uses magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to examine the bile ducts. MRI machines use radio waves and magnets to produce detailed pictures of the bodys internal organs and soft tissues without using x rays. A specially trained technician performs magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography in an outpatient center or a hospital, and a radiologist interprets the images. A patient does not need anesthesia, though a health care provider may use light sedation for patients with a fear of confined spaces. With most MRI machines, the patient lies on a table that slides into a tunnel-shaped device that may be open ended or closed at one end; some machines allow the patient to lie in a more open space.  - Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography uses an x ray to look at the bile ducts. A gastroenterologista doctor who specializes in digestive diseasesperforms the test at a hospital or an outpatient center. After lightly sedating the patient, the gastroenterologist inserts an endoscopea small, flexible tube with a light and a camera on the endthrough the mouth into the duodenum and bile ducts. The endoscope is connected to a computer and video monitor. The gastroenterologist injects a special dye, called contrast medium, through the tube into the bile ducts, which makes the ducts show up on the monitor. This test is more invasive than other imaging tests, and health care providers do not routinely need the test to make the diagnosis of primary biliary cirrhosis. A health care provider uses the test selectively when he or she is concerned that the blockage of the bile ducts has another cause, such as a gallstone or a narrowing of the large bile ducts due to inflammation or cancer. Patients may have pain, nausea, or vomiting after the test or may develop bacterial cholangitis or pancreatitisinflammation of the pancreas.\n                \nLiver biopsy. A liver biopsy is a procedure that involves taking a piece of liver tissue for examination with a microscope for signs of damage or disease. The health care provider may ask the patient to stop taking certain medications temporarily before the liver biopsy. The health care provider may ask the patient to fast for 8 hours before the procedure.\n                \nDuring the procedure, the patient lies on a table, right hand resting above the head. The health care provider applies a local anesthetic to the area where he or she will insert the biopsy needle. If needed, a health care provider will also give sedatives and pain medication. The health care provider uses a needle to take a small piece of liver tissue. He or she may use ultrasound, computerized tomography scans, or other imaging techniques to guide the needle. After the biopsy, the patient must lie on the right side for up to 2 hours and is monitored an additional 2 to 4 hours before being sent home.\n                \nA health care provider performs a liver biopsy at a hospital or an outpatient center. The health care provider sends the liver sample to a pathology lab, where the pathologista doctor who specializes in diagnosing diseaseslooks at the tissue with a microscope and sends a report to the patients health care provider.\n                \nA liver biopsy can confirm the diagnosis of primary biliary cirrhosis; however, a person does not always need this test. A health care provider will perform a biopsy if the AMA blood test is negative and the person shows other signs of primary biliary cirrhosis. Sometimes a health care provider finds a cause of liver damage other than primary biliary cirrhosis during biopsy.",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Primary Biliary Cirrhosis (PBC) is a chronic autoimmune disease that affects the liver. The goal of treatment is to slow the progression of the disease and manage symptoms. Here are some of the common treatments:\n\n1. Ursodeoxycholic Acid (UDCA): This is the first-line treatment for PBC. It helps to improve bile flow and can slow down the progression of the disease.\n\n2. Obeticholic Acid (OCA): This is a second-line treatment for PBC. It is used when UDCA alone is not effective. OCA can help to reduce liver enzymes and improve bile flow.\n\n3. Immunosuppressive Therapy: This is used to suppress the autoimmune response that causes PBC. Examples include corticosteroids and azathioprine.\n\n4. Ursodiol: This is a bile acid that can help to dissolve gallstones and improve bile flow.\n\n5. Symptomatic Treatment: This includes treatment for symptoms such as itching (with antihistamines), fatigue (with modafinil), and osteoporosis (with calcium and vitamin D supplements).\n\n6. Liver Transplant: In severe cases where the liver is severely damaged, a liver transplant may be necessary.\n\nIt's important to note that the best treatment plan for PBC varies for each individual and should be discussed with a healthcare provider.",
        "original_answer": "Treatment for primary biliary cirrhosis depends on how early a health care provider diagnoses the disease and whether complications are present. In the early stages of primary biliary cirrhosis, treatment can slow the progression of liver damage to cirrhosis. In the early stages of cirrhosis, the goals of treatment are to slow the progression of tissue scarring in the liver and prevent complications. As cirrhosis progresses, a person may need additional treatments and hospitalization to manage complications.\n                \nMedications\n                \nHealth care providers prescribe ursodiol (Actigall, Urso) to treat primary biliary cirrhosis. Ursodiol is a nontoxic bile acid that people can take orally. Ursodiol replaces the bile acids that are normally produced by the liver, which are more toxic and can harm the liver. Treatment with ursodiol can reduce levels of bilirubin and liver enzymes in the blood. Early treatment with this medication reduces the likelihood of needing a liver transplant and improves survival.3 Early treatment provides the most benefit; however, ursodiol treatment late in the course of the disease can still slow the progression of liver damage. While ursodiol treatment improves the outcome of primary biliary cirrhosis, it does not cure the disease.\n                \nResearchers are studying the effects of several other medications on the progression of primary biliary cirrhosis. To date, none has shown the positive effects of ursodiol.\n                \nAvoiding Alcohol and Other Substances\n                \nPeople with cirrhosis should not drink any alcohol or take any illegal substances, as both will cause more liver damage. People with cirrhosis should avoid complementary and alternative medications, such as herbs. People with cirrhosis should be careful about starting new medications and should consult a health care provider before taking prescription medications, over-the-counter medications, or vitamins. Many vitamins and prescription and over-the-counter medications can affect liver function.\n                \nTreatment of Symptoms and Complications\n                \nHealth care providers treat symptoms and complications as follows:\n                \nItching. Antihistamines may help with mild itching. However, antihistamines often cause drowsiness, and a person should take antihistamines just before bedtime to help with nighttime itching. A health care provider will treat more problematic itching with cholestyramine (Locholest, Questran), which reduces cholesterol in the blood. Experts believe high levels of cholesterol let substances that cause itching build up in tissues.\n                \nDry eyes and mouth. Health care providers usually treat dry eyes and mouth with artificial tears and saliva substitutes, respectively. These products are available without a prescription. A health care provider may treat people whose symptoms do not improve with pilocarpine (Salagen) or cevimeline (Evoxac). People who have difficulty with dry eyes should see an ophthalmologista doctor who diagnoses and treats all eye diseases and eye disordersregularly. People with dry mouth should have regular dental exams.\n                \nPortal hypertension. A health care provider may prescribe a beta-blocker or nitrate to treat portal hypertension. Beta-blockers lower blood pressure by helping the heart beat slower and with less force, and nitrates relax and widen blood vessels to let more blood flow to the heart and reduce the hearts workload.\n                \nVarices. Beta-blockers can lower the pressure in varices and reduce the likelihood of bleeding. Bleeding in the stomach or esophagus requires an immediate upper endoscopy. This procedure involves using an endoscope to look for varices. The health care provider may use the endoscope to perform a band ligation, a procedure that involves placing a special rubber band around the varices that causes the tissue to die and fall off. A gastroenterologist performs the procedure at a hospital or an outpatient center. People who have had varices in the past may need to take medication to prevent future episodes.\n                \nEdema and ascites. Health care providers prescribe diureticsmedications that remove fluid from the bodyto treat edema and ascites. A health care provider may remove large amounts of ascitic fluid from the abdomen and check for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. A health care provider may prescribe bacteria-fighting medications called antibiotics to prevent infection. He or she may prescribe oral antibiotics; however, severe infection with ascites requires intravenous (IV) antibiotics.\n                \nHepatic encephalopathy. A health care provider will treat hepatic encephalopathy by cleansing the bowel with lactulose, a laxative given orally or as an enemaa liquid put into the rectum. A health care provider may also add antibiotics to the treatment. Hepatic encephalopathy may improve as other complications of cirrhosis are controlled.\n                \nOsteoporosis. A health care provider may prescribe bisphosphonate medications to improve bone density.\n                \nGallstones and bile duct stones. A health care provider may use surgery to remove gallstones. He or she may use endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, which uses balloons and basketlike devices, to retrieve the bile duct stones.\n                \nLiver cancer. A health care provider may recommend screening tests every 6 to 12 months to check for signs of liver cancer. Screening tests can find cancer before the person has symptoms of the disease. Cancer treatment is usually more effective when the health care provider finds the disease early. Health care providers use blood tests, ultrasound, or both to screen for liver cancer in people with cirrhosis. He or she may treat cancer with a combination of surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy.",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Cirrhosis is a late stage of scarring (fibrosis) of the liver caused by various forms of liver diseases and conditions, such as hepatitis and alcohol abuse. As the liver tries to heal itself from injuries, excessive scar tissue forms, leading to the loss of liver function. Cirrhosis is irreversible, but treatment can slow down its progression and prevent complications. Symptoms may include fatigue, loss of appetite, weight loss, nausea, and swelling in the legs and abdomen. In advanced stages, it can lead to liver failure and other complications.",
        "original_answer": "Cirrhosis is a condition in which the liver slowly deteriorates and is unable to function normally due to chronic, or long lasting, injury. Scar tissue replaces healthy liver tissue and partially blocks the flow of blood through the liver.\n                \nThe liver is the bodys largest internal organ. The liver is called the bodys metabolic factory because of the important role it plays in metabolismthe way cells change food into energy after food is digested and absorbed into the blood. The liver has many functions, including\n                \n- taking up, storing, and processing nutrients from foodincluding fat, sugar, and proteinand delivering them to the rest of the body when needed  - making new proteins, such as clotting factors and immune factors  - producing bile, which helps the body absorb fats, cholesterol, and fat-soluble vitamins  - removing waste products the kidneys cannot remove, such as fats, cholesterol, toxins, and medications\n                \nA healthy liver is necessary for survival. The liver can regenerate most of its own cells when they become damaged. However, if injury to the liver is too severe or long lasting, regeneration is incomplete, and the liver creates scar tissue. Scarring of the liver, also called fibrosis, may lead to cirrhosis.\n                \nThe buildup of scar tissue that causes cirrhosis is usually a slow and gradual process. In the early stages of cirrhosis, the liver continues to function. However, as cirrhosis gets worse and scar tissue replaces more healthy tissue, the liver will begin to fail. Chronic liver failure, which is also called end-stage liver disease, progresses over months, years, or even decades. With end-stage liver disease, the liver can no longer perform important functions or effectively replace damaged cells.\n                \nCirrhosis is the 12th leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for nearly 32,000 deaths each year.

        "original_answer": "Cirrhosis has various causes. Many people with cirrhosis have more than one cause of liver damage.\n                \nThe list below shows common causes of cirrhosis in the United States.2 While chronic hepatitis C and alcohol-related liver disease are the most common causes of cirrhosis, the incidence of cirrhosis caused by nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is rising due to increasing rates of obesity.\n                \nMost Common Causes of Cirrhosis\n                \nChronic hepatitis C. Hepatitis C is due to a viral infection that causes inflammation, or swelling, and damage to the liver. The hepatitis C virus spreads through contact with infected blood, such as from a needlestick accident, injection drug use, or receiving a blood transfusion before 1992. Less commonly, hepatitis C can be spread by sexual contact with an infected person or at the time of childbirth from an infected mother to her newborn.\n                \nHepatitis C often becomes chronic, with long-term persistence of the viral infection. Chronic hepatitis C causes damage to the liver that, over years or decades, can lead to cirrhosis. Advanced therapies for chronic hepatitis C now exist, and health care providers should treat people with chronic hepatitis C before they develop severe fibrosis or cirrhosis. Unfortunately, many people first realize they have chronic hepatitis C when they develop symptoms of cirrhosis. More information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, What I need to know about Hepatitis C.\n                \nAlcohol-related liver disease. Alcoholism is the second most common cause of cirrhosis in the United States. Most people who consume alcohol do not suffer damage to the liver. However, heavy alcohol use over several years makes a person more likely to develop alcohol-related liver disease. The amount of alcohol it takes to damage the liver varies from person to person. Research suggests that drinking two or fewer drinks a day for women and three or fewer drinks a day for men may not injure the liver.3 Drinking more than these amounts leads to fat and inflammation in the liver, which over 10 to 12 years can lead to alcoholic cirrhosis.4\n                \nNonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). In NAFLD, fat builds up in the liver; however, the fat buildup is not due to alcohol use. When the fat accompanies inflammation and liver cell damage, the condition is called nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH, with steato meaning fat, and hepatitis meaning inflammation of the liver. The inflammation and damage can cause fibrosis, which eventually can lead to cirrhosis.\n                \nExtra fat in the liver has many causes and is more common in people who\n                \n- are overweight or obese.  - have diabetesa condition characterized by high blood glucose, also called high blood sugar.  - have high blood cholesterol and triglycerides, called hyperlipidemia.  - have high blood pressure.  - have metabolic syndromea group of traits and medical conditions linked to being overweight and obese that makes people more likely to develop both cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. Metabolic syndrome is defined as the presence of any three of the following: large waist size, high triglycerides in the blood, abnormal levels of cholesterol in the blood, high blood pressure, and higher than normal blood glucose levels. NASH may represent the liver component of the metabolic syndrome.\n                \nNASH now ranks as the third most common cause of cirrhosis in the United States. More information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis.\n                \nChronic hepatitis B. Hepatitis B, like hepatitis C, is due to a viral infection that causes inflammation and damage to the liver. Chronic infection can lead to damage and inflammation, fibrosis, and cirrhosis. The hepatitis B virus spreads through contact with infected blood, such as by needlestick accident, injection drug use, or receiving a blood transfusion before the mid-1980s. Hepatitis B also spreads through sexual contact with an infected person and from an infected mother to child during childbirth.\n                \nIn the United States, hepatitis B is somewhat uncommon, affecting less than 1 percent of the population, or fewer than one in 100 people.5 In many areas of the world, however, hepatitis B is common. In some parts of Africa and in most of Asia and the Pacific Islands, about 5 to 7 percent of the population has chronic hepatitis B. In some parts of Africa, more than 8 percent of the population has chronic hepatitis B.6 For these reasons, hepatitis B is likely the major cause of cirrhosis worldwide. However, in the United States, hepatitis B ranks well behind hepatitis C, alcohol-related liver disease, and NASH.\n                \nTherapies for chronic hepatitis B now exist and health care providers should treat people with chronic hepatitis B before they develop severe fibrosis or cirrhosis. Unfortunately, many people first realize they have chronic hepatitis B when they develop symptoms of cirrhosis.\n                \nHepatitis B is also a preventable disease. Since the 1980s, a hepatitis B vaccine has been available and should be given to newborns and children in the United States. Adults at higher risk of getting hepatitis B should also get the vaccine. More information is provided in the NIDDK health topics, What I need to know about Hepatitis B and Hepatitis B: What Asian and Pacific Islander Americans Need to Know.\n                \nLess Common Causes of Cirrhosis\n                \nLess common causes of cirrhosis include the following:\n                \nAutoimmune hepatitis. In this form of hepatitis, the bodys immune system attacks liver cells and causes inflammation, damage, and eventually cirrhosis. Normally, the immune system protects people from infection by identifying and destroying bacteria, viruses, and other potentially harmful foreign substances. In autoimmune diseases, the bodys immune system attacks the bodys own cells and organs. Researchers believe genetics, or inherited genes, may make some people more likely to develop autoimmune diseases. At least 70 percent of those with autoimmune hepatitis are female.7 More information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Autoimmune Hepatitis.\n                \nDiseases that damage, destroy, or block the bile ducts. Several diseases can damage, destroy, or block the ducts that carry bile from the liver to the small intestine, causing bile to back up in the liver and leading to cirrhosis. In adults, the most common of these diseases is primary biliary cirrhosis, a chronic disease that causes the small bile ducts in the liver to become inflamed and damaged and ultimately disappear. Primary sclerosing cholangitis is a disease that causes irritation, scarring, and narrowing of the larger bile ducts of the liver.\n                \nIn infants and children, causes of damage to or disappearance of bile ducts that can lead to cirrhosis include\n                \n- Alagille syndrome, a collection of symptoms that indicates a genetic digestive disorder and leads to a loss of bile ducts in infancy.  - biliary atresia, a life-threatening condition that affects newborns in which bile ducts are missing. The cause is unknown. Biliary atresia is the most common reason for liver transplantation in children.8  - cystic fibrosis, an inherited disease of the lungs, intestines, pancreas, and bile ducts in which the body does not produce enough fluid and mucus becomes thick and blocks off small bile ducts. This blockage of the bile ducts can lead to cirrhosis.\n                \nLong-term blockage of the bile ducts by gallstones can cause cirrhosis. Cirrhosis may also develop if the bile ducts are mistakenly tied off or injured during surgery on the gallbladder or liver.\n                \nMore information is provided in the NIDDK health topics:\n                \n- Primary Biliary Cirrhosis  - Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis  - Alagille Syndrome  - Biliary Atresia  - Gallstones\n                \nInherited diseases that affect the liver. Inherited diseases that interfere with how the liver produces, processes, and stores enzymes, proteins, metals, and other substances can cause cirrhosis. These diseases include alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, hemochromatosis, Wilson disease, galactosemia, and glycogen storage diseases. More information is provided in the NIDDK health topics:\n                \n- Hemochromatosis  - Wilson Disease\n                \nRare viral infections of the liver. Hepatitis D, or hepatitis delta, and hepatitis E are two rare viral infections of the liver. Hepatitis D infection occurs only in people who have hepatitis B. People infected with chronic hepatitis B and chronic hepatitis D are more likely to develop cirrhosis than people infected with chronic hepatitis B alone.9\n                \nHepatitis E is a virus found in domestic and wild animals, particularly pigs, and can cause hepatitis in humans. People with weakened immune systems, including people who are liver or kidney transplant recipients or who have acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), can develop chronic hepatitis E. Chronic hepatitis E can cause scarring of the liver and cirrhosis. Current treatments for chronic hepatitis D and E are experimental and only partially effective.\n                \nOther causes. Other causes of cirrhosis may include\n                \n- reactions to medications taken over a period of time.  - prolonged exposure to toxic chemicals.  - parasitic infections.  - chronic heart failure with liver congestion, a condition in which blood flow out of the liver is slowed. Liver congestion can also occur after surgery to correct a congenital heart problema heart problem that is present at birth.\n                \nTrauma to the liver or other acute, or short term, causes of damage do not cause cirrhosis. Usually, years of chronic injury are required to cause cirrhosis.",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Cirrhosis is a late stage of scarring (fibrosis) of the liver caused by many forms of liver diseases and conditions. Complications of cirrhosis can include:\n\n1. Portal hypertension: This occurs when the blood pressure in the portal vein (the large vein that brings blood to the liver) becomes elevated.\n2. Ascites: This is the accumulation of fluid in the abdominal cavity.\n3. Esophageal varices: These are enlarged veins in the esophagus that can rupture and bleed.\n4. Hepatic encephalopathy: This is the deterioration of brain function due to the liver's inability to remove toxins from the blood.\n5. Liver cancer: Cirrhosis is a major risk factor for the development of liver cancer.\n6. Liver failure: This is the inability of the liver to perform its normal functions, which can be life-threatening. \n\nIt's important to note that these complications can be managed or even prevented with early detection and treatment of cirrhosis.",
        "original_answer": "As the liver fails, complications may develop. In some people, complications may be the first signs of the disease. Complications of cirrhosis may include the following:\n                \nPortal hypertension. The portal vein carries blood from the stomach, intestines, spleen, gallbladder, and pancreas to the liver. In cirrhosis, scar tissue partially blocks the normal flow of blood, which increases the pressure in the portal vein. This condition is called portal hypertension. Portal hypertension is a common complication of cirrhosis. This condition may lead to other complications, such as\n                \n- fluid buildup leading to edema and ascites  - enlarged blood vessels, called varices, in the esophagus, stomach, or both  - an enlarged spleen, called splenomegaly  - mental confusion due to a buildup of toxins that are ordinarily removed by the liver, a condition called hepatic encephalopathy\n                \nEdema and ascites. Liver failure causes fluid buildup that results in edema and ascites. Ascites can lead to spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, a serious infection that requires immediate medical attention.\n                \nVarices. Portal hypertension may cause enlarged blood vessels in the esophagus, stomach, or both. These enlarged blood vessels, called esophageal or gastric varices, cause the vessel walls to become thin and blood pressure to increase, making the blood vessels more likely to burst. If they burst, serious bleeding can occur in the esophagus or upper stomach, requiring immediate medical attention.\n                \nSplenomegaly. Portal hypertension may cause the spleen to enlarge and retain white blood cells and platelets, reducing the numbers of these cells and platelets in the blood. A low platelet count may be the first evidence that a person has developed cirrhosis.\n                \nHepatic encephalopathy. A failing liver cannot remove toxins from the blood, so they eventually accumulate in the brain. The buildup of toxins in the brain is called hepatic encephalopathy. This condition can decrease mental function and cause stupor and even coma. Stupor is an unconscious, sleeplike state from which a person can only be aroused briefly by a strong stimulus, such as a sharp pain. Coma is an unconscious, sleeplike state from which a person cannot be aroused. Signs of decreased mental function include\n                \n- confusion  - personality changes  - memory loss  - trouble concentrating  - a change in sleep habits\n                \nMetabolic bone diseases. Some people with cirrhosis develop a metabolic bone disease, which is a disorder of bone strength usually caused by abnormalities of vitamin D, bone mass, bone structure, or minerals, such as calcium and phosphorous. Osteopenia is a condition in which the bones become less dense, making them weaker. When bone loss becomes more severe, the condition is referred to as osteoporosis. People with these conditions are more likely to develop bone fractures.\n                \nGallstones and bile duct stones. If cirrhosis prevents bile from flowing freely to and from the gallbladder, the bile hardens into gallstones. Symptoms of gallstones include abdominal pain and recurrent bacterial cholangitisirritated or infected bile ducts. Stones may also form in and block the bile ducts, causing pain, jaundice, and bacterial cholangitis.\n                \nBruising and bleeding. When the liver slows the production of or stops producing the proteins needed for blood clotting, a person will bruise or bleed easily.\n                \nSensitivity to medications. Cirrhosis slows the livers ability to filter medications from the blood. When this slowdown occurs, medications act longer than expected and build up in the body. For example, some pain medications may have a stronger effect or produce more side effects in people with cirrhosis than in people with a healthy liver.\n                \nInsulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Cirrhosis causes resistance to insulin. The pancreas tries to keep up with the demand for insulin by producing more; however, extra glucose builds up in the bloodstream, causing type 2 diabetes.\n                \nLiver cancer. Liver cancer is common in people with cirrhosis. Liver cancer has a high mortality rate. Current treatments are limited and only fully successful if a health care provider detects the cancer early, before the tumor is too large. For this reason, health care providers should check people with cirrhosis for signs of liver cancer every 6 to 12 months. Health care providers use blood tests, ultrasound, or both to check for signs of liver cancer.\n                \nOther complications. Cirrhosis can cause immune system dysfunction, leading to an increased chance of infection. Cirrhosis can also cause kidney and lung failure, known as hepatorenal and hepatopulmonary syndromes.",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Cirrhosis is typically diagnosed through a combination of medical history, physical examination, and diagnostic tests. These tests may include:\n\n1. Blood tests: These can detect elevated levels of liver enzymes, which can indicate liver damage. They can also measure levels of certain proteins and chemicals produced by the liver.\n\n2. Imaging tests: These may include ultrasound, CT scan, or MRI, which can provide images of the liver and help detect any abnormalities.\n\n3. Liver biopsy: This is a procedure where a small sample of liver tissue is removed and examined under a microscope for signs of cirrhosis.\n\n4. Endoscopy: This is a procedure where a thin, flexible tube with a camera at the end is inserted into the body to examine the esophagus and stomach for signs of varices (enlarged veins) which can be a complication of cirrhosis.\n\nIt is important to note that by the time cirrhosis is diagnosed, significant liver damage has already occurred. Therefore, it is important to be proactive about liver health by avoiding alcohol, maintaining a healthy diet, and getting vaccinated against hepatitis.",
        "original_answer": "A health care provider usually diagnoses cirrhosis based on the presence of conditions that increase its likelihood, such as heavy alcohol use or obesity, and symptoms. A health care provider may test for cirrhosis based on the presence of these conditions alone because many people do not have symptoms in the early stages of the disease. A health care provider may confirm the diagnosis with\n                \n- a medical and family history  - a physical exam  - a blood test  - imaging tests  - a liver biopsy\n                \nMedical and family history. Taking a medical and family history is one of the first things a health care provider may do to help diagnose cirrhosis. He or she will ask the patient to provide a medical and family history.\n                \nPhysical exam. A physical exam may help diagnose cirrhosis. During a physical exam, a health care provider usually\n                \n- examines a patients body  - uses a stethoscope to listen to sounds in the abdomen  - taps on specific areas of the patients body\n                \nThe health care provider will perform a physical exam to look for signs of the disease. For example, the liver may feel hard or ascites may cause the abdomen to enlarge.\n                \nBlood test. A blood test involves drawing blood at a health care providers office or a commercial facility and sending the sample to a lab for analysis. Blood tests can show abnormal liver enzyme levels or abnormal numbers of blood cells or platelets.\n                \nBlood tests can help find the cause in people with diagnosed cirrhosis. For example, a health care provider may use blood tests to diagnose hepatitis B and C.\n                \nHealth care providers use three blood tests to measure the severity of cirrhosis:\n                \n- bilirubin, which tests the amount of bile pigment in the blood  - creatinine, which tests kidney function  - international normalized ratio, which tests the bloods ability to clot\n                \nThe results of these blood tests are used to calculate the Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) score. Experts developed the MELD score to predict the 90-day survival rate of people with end-stage liver disease. MELD scores usually range between 6 and 40, with a score of 6 indicating the best likelihood of 90-day survival. The MELD score is used to determine whether a person is eligible for liver transplantation.\n                \nImaging tests. Imaging tests can show signs of advanced cirrhosis, such as irregularities in the liver surface, gastric varices, and splenomegaly. These tests can also detect signs of complications, such as ascites and liver cancer.\n                \n- Ultrasound uses a device, called a transducer, that bounces safe, painless sound waves off organs to create an image of their structure. A specially trained technician performs the procedure in a health care providers office, an outpatient center, or a hospital, and a radiologista doctor who specializes in medical imaginginterprets the images. A patient does not need anesthesia.  - Computerized tomography (CT) scans use a combination of x rays and computer technology to create images. For a CT scan, a technician may give the patient a solution to drink and an injection of a special dye, called contrast medium. CT scans require the patient to lie on a table that slides into a tunnelshaped device where the technician takes the x rays. An x-ray technician performs the procedure in an outpatient center or a hospital, and a radiologist interprets the images. A patient does not need anesthesia.  - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machines use radio waves and magnets to produce detailed pictures of the bodys internal organs and soft tissues without using x rays. A specially trained technician performs the procedure in an outpatient center or a hospital, and a radiologist interprets the images. A patient does not need anesthesia, though a health care provider may use light sedation for patients with a fear of confined spaces. An MRI may include the injection of contrast medium. With most MRI machines, the patient lies on a table that slides into a tunnel-shaped device that may be open ended or closed at one end; some machines allow the patient to lie in a more open space.  - Elastography, also called liver stiffness measurement, uses either ultrasound or MRI to measure the stiffness of the liver. Scar tissue increases the stiffness of the liver. Elastography can show how much scarring is present with some reliability. Elastography is a relatively new test. However, this test promises to be helpful in showing how severe liver scarring is and whether the scarring is getting worse over time.\n                \nLiver biopsy. A liver biopsy is a procedure that involves taking a piece of liver tissue for examination with a microscope for signs of damage or disease. The health care provider may ask the patient to stop taking certain medications temporarily before the liver biopsy. The health care provider may ask the patient to fast for 8 hours before the procedure.\n                \nDuring the procedure, the patient lies on a table, right hand resting above the head. The health care provider applies a local anesthetic to the area where he or she will insert the biopsy needle. If needed, a health care provider will also give sedatives and pain medication. The health care provider uses a needle to take a small piece of liver tissue. He or she may use ultrasound, CT scans, or other imaging techniques to guide the needle. After the biopsy, the patient must lie on the right side for up to 2 hours and is monitored an additional 2 to 4 hours before being sent home.\n                \nA health care provider performs a liver biopsy at a hospital or an outpatient center. The health care provider sends the liver sample to a pathology lab, where the pathologista doctor who specializes in diagnosing diseaseslooks at the tissue with a microscope and sends a report to the patients health care provider.\n                \nA liver biopsy can confirm the diagnosis of cirrhosis; however, a person does not always need this test. A health care provider will perform a biopsy if the result might help determine the cause or affect treatment. Sometimes a health care provider finds a cause of liver damage other than cirrhosis during biopsy.",

Lifestyle modifications: This includes avoiding alcohol, maintaining a healthy diet, staying hydrated, and getting regular exercise.\n2. Medications: Medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms such as itching, fatigue, and fluid retention. In addition, medications may be used to prevent or treat complications such as infections, bleeding, and portal hypertension.\n3. Surgery: In some cases, surgery may be necessary to treat complications of cirrhosis. For example, a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedure may be performed to reduce portal hypertension and prevent bleeding.\n4. Liver transplant: In severe cases of cirrhosis, a liver transplant may be necessary. This involves surgically removing the damaged liver and replacing it with a healthy donor liver.\n\nIt is important to note that the best treatment for cirrhosis varies depending on the underlying cause of the disease and the severity of the symptoms. It is important to work closely with a healthcare provider to develop an individualized treatment plan.",
        "original_answer": "Treatment for cirrhosis depends on the cause of the disease and whether complications are present. In the early stages of cirrhosis, the goals of treatment are to slow the progression of tissue scarring in the liver and prevent complications. As cirrhosis progresses, a person may need additional treatments and hospitalization to manage complications. Treatment may include the following:\n                \nAvoiding Alcohol and Illegal Substances\n                \nPeople with cirrhosis should not drink any alcohol or take any illegal substances, as both will cause more liver damage.\n                \nPreventing Problems with Medications\n                \nPeople with cirrhosis should be careful about starting new medications and should consult a health care provider before taking prescription medications, over-the-counter medications, or vitamins. People with cirrhosis should avoid complementary and alternative medications, such as herbs.\n                \nCirrhosis slows the livers ability to filter medications from the blood. When this slowdown occurs, medications act longer than expected and build up in the body. Some medications and vitamins may also affect liver function.\n                \nViral Hepatitis Vaccination and Screening\n                \nAll people with cirrhosis should consider vaccination against hepatitis A and B. An infection with one of these hepatitis viruses can cause cirrhosis to get worse. Vaccination can easily prevent both infections.\n                \nPeople with cirrhosis should also get a screening blood test for hepatitis C.\n                \nTreating Causes of Cirrhosis\n                \nHealth care providers can treat some causes of cirrhosis, for example, by prescribing antiviral medications for hepatitis B and C. In some instances, these medications cure the viral infection. Health care providers treat autoimmune hepatitis with corticosteroids and other medications that suppress the immune system. Health care providers can treat hemochromatosis and Wilson diseaseinherited forms of liver disease caused by the buildup of iron or copper in the liverif detected early. Health care providers usually treat liver diseases due to blockage or loss of bile ducts with ursodiol (Actigall, Urso). Ursodiol is a nontoxic bile acid that people can take orally. Ursodiol replaces the bile acids that are normally produced by the liver, which are toxic and build up in the liver when the bile ducts are blocked.\n                \nTreating Symptoms and Complications of Cirrhosis\n                \nItching and abdominal pain. A health care provider may give medications to treat various symptoms of cirrhosis, such as itching and abdominal pain.\n                \nPortal hypertension. A health care provider may prescribe a beta-blocker or nitrate to treat portal hypertension. Beta-blockers lower blood pressure by helping the heart beat slower and with less force, and nitrates relax and widen blood vessels to let more blood flow to the heart and reduce the hearts workload.\n                \nVarices. Beta-blockers can lower the pressure in varices and reduce the likelihood of bleeding. Bleeding in the stomach or esophagus requires an immediate upper endoscopy. This procedure involves using an endoscopea small, flexible tube with a lightto look for varices. The health care provider may use the endoscope to perform a band ligation, a procedure that involves placing a special rubber band around the varices that causes the tissue to die and fall off. A gastroenterologista doctor who specializes in digestive diseasesperforms the procedure at a hospital or an outpatient center. People who have had varices in the past may need to take medication to prevent future episodes.\n                \nEdema and ascites. Health care providers prescribe diureticsmedications that remove fluid from the bodyto treat edema and ascites. A health care provider may remove large amounts of ascitic fluid from the abdomen and check for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. A health care provider may prescribe bacteria-fighting medications called antibiotics to prevent infection. He or she may prescribe oral antibiotics; however, severe infection with ascites requires intravenous (IV) antibiotics.\n                \nHepatic encephalopathy. A health care provider treats hepatic encephalopathy by cleansing the bowel with lactulose, a laxative given orally or as an enemaa liquid put into the rectum. A health care provider may also add antibiotics to the treatment. Hepatic encephalopathy may improve as other complications of cirrhosis are controlled.\n                \nHepatorenal syndrome. Some people with cirrhosis who develop hepatorenal syndrome must undergo regular dialysis treatment, which filters wastes and extra fluid from the body by means other than the kidneys. People may also need medications to improve blood flow through the kidneys.\n                \nOsteoporosis. A health care provider may prescribe bisphosphonate medications to improve bone density.\n                \nGallstones and bile duct stones. A health care provider may use surgery to remove gallstones. He or she may use endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, which uses balloons and basketlike devices, to retrieve the bile duct stones.\n                \nLiver cancer. A health care provider may recommend screening tests every 6 to 12 months to check for signs of liver cancer. Screening tests can find cancer before the person has symptoms of the disease. Cancer treatment is usually more effective when the health care provider finds the disease early. Health care providers use blood tests, ultrasound, or both to screen for liver cancer in people with cirrhosis.

Maintain a healthy diet: Eating a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins can help support liver function and overall health.\n3. Monitor sodium intake: People with cirrhosis are at risk of fluid retention and ascites (a buildup of fluid in the abdomen). Limiting sodium intake can help manage these complications.\n4. Stay hydrated: Drinking plenty of water and other non-alcoholic beverages can help prevent dehydration and support overall health.\n5. Get vaccinated: Vaccinations against hepatitis A and B, influenza, pneumococcal pneumonia, and other infections can help protect the liver and overall health.\n6. Manage underlying conditions: If you have cirrhosis due to an underlying condition (such as hepatitis C), work with your healthcare provider to manage that condition effectively.\n7. Regular monitoring: Regular check-ups with your healthcare provider can help monitor your liver function and overall health.\n\nRemember, it is essential to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized recommendations and management strategies for cirrhosis.",
        "original_answer": "- Cirrhosis is a condition in which the liver slowly deteriorates and is unable to function normally due to chronic, or long lasting, injury. Scar tissue replaces healthy liver tissue and partially blocks the flow of blood through the liver.  - The most common causes of cirrhosis in the United States are chronic hepatitis C, alcohol-related liver disease, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and chronic hepatitis B.  - Many people with cirrhosis have no symptoms in the early stages of the disease. However, as the disease progresses, a person may experience the following symptoms:      - fatigue, or feeling tired    - weakness    - itching    - loss of appetite    - weight loss    - nausea    - bloating of the abdomen from ascitesa buildup of fluid in the abdomen    - edemaswelling due to a buildup of fluidin the feet, ankles, or legs    - spiderlike blood vessels, called spider angiomas, on the skin    - jaundice, a condition that causes the skin and whites of the eyes to turn yellow    - As the liver fails, complications may develop. In some people, complications may be the first signs of the disease.  - A health care provider usually diagnoses cirrhosis based on the presence of conditions that increase its likelihood, such as heavy alcohol use or obesity, and symptoms. A health care provider may confirm the diagnosis with      - a medical and family history    - a physical exam    - a blood test    - imaging tests    - a liver biopsy    - Treatment for cirrhosis depends on the cause of the disease and whether complications are present.  - A health care provider may consider a liver transplant when cirrhosis leads to liver failure or treatment for complications is ineffective.",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "There are three main types of diabetes: type 1, type 2, and gestational.\n\nType 1 diabetes is caused by an autoimmune reaction where the body's immune system attacks the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas, destroying their ability to produce insulin. The exact cause is unknown, but it is believed to have a genetic component.\n\nType 2 diabetes is caused by a combination of genetic and lifestyle factors. It occurs when the body becomes resistant to insulin or doesn't produce enough insulin to maintain normal glucose levels. Risk factors include being overweight or obese, physical inactivity, family history, and older age.\n\nGestational diabetes is caused by hormonal changes during pregnancy that can lead to insulin resistance.

        "original_answer": "Diabetes is a complex group of diseases with a variety of causes. People with diabetes have high blood glucose, also called high blood sugar or hyperglycemia.\n                \nDiabetes is a disorder of metabolismthe way the body uses digested food for energy. The digestive tract breaks down carbohydratessugars and starches found in many foodsinto glucose, a form of sugar that enters the bloodstream. With the help of the hormone insulin, cells throughout the body absorb glucose and use it for energy. Diabetes develops when the body doesnt make enough insulin or is not able to use insulin effectively, or both.\n                \nInsulin is made in the pancreas, an organ located behind the stomach. The pancreas contains clusters of cells called islets. Beta cells within the islets make insulin and release it into the blood.\n                \nIf beta cells dont produce enough insulin, or the body doesnt respond to the insulin that is present, glucose builds up in the blood instead of being absorbed by cells in the body, leading to prediabetes or diabetes. Prediabetes is a condition in which blood glucose levels or A1C levelswhich reflect average blood glucose levelsare higher than normal but not high enough to be diagnosed as diabetes. In diabetes, the bodys cells are starved of energy despite high blood glucose levels.\n                \nOver time, high blood glucose damages nerves and blood vessels, leading to complications such as heart disease, stroke, kidney disease, blindness, dental disease, and amputations. Other complications of diabetes may include increased susceptibility to other diseases, loss of mobility with aging, depression, and pregnancy problems. No one is certain what starts the processes that cause diabetes, but scientists believe genes and environmental factors interact to cause diabetes in most cases.\n                \nThe two main types of diabetes are type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. A third type, gestational diabetes, develops only during pregnancy. Other types of diabetes are caused by defects in specific genes, diseases of the pancreas, certain drugs or chemicals, infections, and other conditions. Some people show signs of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes.",

        "original_answer": "Type 1 diabetes is caused by a lack of insulin due to the destruction of insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. In type 1 diabetesan autoimmune diseasethe bodys immune system attacks and destroys the beta cells. Normally, the immune system protects the body from infection by identifying and destroying bacteria, viruses, and other potentially harmful foreign substances. But in autoimmune diseases, the immune system attacks the bodys own cells. In type 1 diabetes, beta cell destruction may take place over several years, but symptoms of the disease usually develop over a short period of time.\n                \nType 1 diabetes typically occurs in children and young adults, though it can appear at any age. In the past, type 1 diabetes was called juvenile diabetes or insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.\n                \nLatent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) may be a slowly developing kind of type 1 diabetes. Diagnosis usually occurs after age 30. In LADA, as in type 1 diabetes, the bodys immune system destroys the beta cells. At the time of diagnosis, people with LADA may still produce their own insulin, but eventually most will need insulin shots or an insulin pump to control blood glucose levels.\n                \nGenetic Susceptibility\n                \nHeredity plays an important part in determining who is likely to develop type 1 diabetes. Genes are passed down from biological parent to child. Genes carry instructions for making proteins that are needed for the bodys cells to function. Many genes, as well as interactions among genes, are thought to influence susceptibility to and protection from type 1 diabetes. The key genes may vary in different population groups. Variations in genes that affect more than 1 percent of a population group are called gene variants.\n                \nCertain gene variants that carry instructions for making proteins called human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) on white blood cells are linked to the risk of developing type 1 diabetes. The proteins produced by HLA genes help determine whether the immune system recognizes a cell as part of the body or as foreign material. Some combinations of HLA gene variants predict that a person will be at higher risk for type 1 diabetes, while other combinations are protective or have no effect on risk.\n                \nWhile HLA genes are the major risk genes for type 1 diabetes, many additional risk genes or gene regions have been found. Not only can these genes help identify people at risk for type 1 diabetes, but they also provide important clues to help scientists better understand how the disease develops and identify potential targets for therapy and prevention.\n                \nGenetic testing can show what types of HLA genes a person carries and can reveal other genes linked to diabetes. However, most genetic testing is done in a research setting and is not yet available to individuals. Scientists are studying how the results of genetic testing can be used to improve type 1 diabetes prevention or treatment.\n                \nAutoimmune Destruction of Beta Cells\n                \nIn type 1 diabetes, white blood cells called T cells attack and destroy beta cells. The process begins well before diabetes symptoms appear and continues after diagnosis. Often, type 1 diabetes is not diagnosed until most beta cells have already been destroyed. At this point, a person needs daily insulin treatment to survive. Finding ways to modify or stop this autoimmune process and preserve beta cell function is a major focus of current scientific research.\n                \nRecent research suggests insulin itself may be a key trigger of the immune attack on beta cells. The immune systems of people who are susceptible to developing type 1 diabetes respond to insulin as if it were a foreign substance, or antigen. To combat antigens, the body makes proteins called antibodies. Antibodies to insulin and other proteins produced by beta cells are found in people with type 1 diabetes. Researchers test for these antibodies to help identify people at increased risk of developing the disease. Testing the types and levels of antibodies in the blood can help determine whether a person has type 1 diabetes, LADA, or another type of diabetes.\n                \nEnvironmental Factors\n                \nEnvironmental factors, such as foods, viruses, and toxins, may play a role in the development of type 1 diabetes, but the exact nature of their role has not been determined. Some theories suggest that environmental factors trigger the autoimmune destruction of beta cells in people with a genetic susceptibility to diabetes. Other theories suggest that environmental factors play an ongoing role in diabetes, even after diagnosis.\n                \nViruses and infections. A virus cannot cause diabetes on its own, but people are sometimes diagnosed with type 1 diabetes during or after a viral infection, suggesting a link between the two. Also, the onset of type 1 diabetes occurs more frequently during the winter when viral infections are more common. Viruses possibly associated with type 1 diabetes include coxsackievirus B, cytomegalovirus, adenovirus, rubella, and mumps. Scientists have described several ways these viruses may damage or destroy beta cells or possibly trigger an autoimmune response in susceptible people. For example, anti-islet antibodies have been found in patients with congenital rubella syndrome, and cytomegalovirus has been associated with significant beta cell damage and acute pancreatitisinflammation of the pancreas. Scientists are trying to identify a virus that can cause type 1 diabetes so that a vaccine might be developed to prevent the disease.\n                \nInfant feeding practices. Some studies have suggested that dietary factors may raise or lower the risk of developing type 1 diabetes. For example, breastfed infants and infants receiving vitamin D supplements may have a reduced risk of developing type 1 diabetes, while early exposure to cows milk and cereal proteins may increase risk. More research is needed to clarify how infant nutrition affects the risk for type 1 diabetes.\n                \nRead more in the Centers for Disease Control and Preventions (CDCs) publication  National Diabetes Statistics Report, 2014 at  www.cdc.gov for information about research studies related to type 1 diabetes.",

        "original_answer": "Type 2 diabetesthe most common form of diabetesis caused by a combination of factors, including insulin resistance, a condition in which the bodys muscle, fat, and liver cells do not use insulin effectively. Type 2 diabetes develops when the body can no longer produce enough insulin to compensate for the impaired ability to use insulin. Symptoms of type 2 diabetes may develop gradually and can be subtle; some people with type 2 diabetes remain undiagnosed for years.\n                \nType 2 diabetes develops most often in middle-aged and older people who are also overweight or obese. The disease, once rare in youth, is becoming more common in overweight and obese children and adolescents. Scientists think genetic susceptibility and environmental factors are the most likely triggers of type 2 diabetes.\n                \nGenetic Susceptibility\n                \nGenes play a significant part in susceptibility to type 2 diabetes. Having certain genes or combinations of genes may increase or decrease a persons risk for developing the disease. The role of genes is suggested by the high rate of type 2 diabetes in families and identical twins and wide variations in diabetes prevalence by ethnicity. Type 2 diabetes occurs more frequently in African Americans, Alaska Natives, American Indians, Hispanics/Latinos, and some Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islander Americans than it does in non-Hispanic whites.\n                \nRecent studies have combined genetic data from large numbers of people, accelerating the pace of gene discovery. Though scientists have now identified many gene variants that increase susceptibility to type 2 diabetes, the majority have yet to be discovered. The known genes appear to affect insulin production rather than insulin resistance. Researchers are working to identify additional gene variants and to learn how they interact with one another and with environmental factors to cause diabetes.\n                \nStudies have shown that variants of the TCF7L2 gene increase susceptibility to type 2 diabetes. For people who inherit two copies of the variants, the risk of developing type 2 diabetes is about 80 percent higher than for those who do not carry the gene variant.1 However, even in those with the variant, diet and physical activity leading to weight loss help delay diabetes, according to the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), a major clinical trial involving people at high risk.\n                \nGenes can also increase the risk of diabetes by increasing a persons tendency to become overweight or obese. One theory, known as the thrifty gene hypothesis, suggests certain genes increase the efficiency of metabolism to extract energy from food and store the energy for later use. This survival trait was advantageous for populations whose food supplies were scarce or unpredictable and could help keep people alive during famine. In modern times, however, when high-calorie foods are plentiful, such a trait can promote obesity and type 2 diabetes.\n                \nObesity and Physical Inactivity\n                \nPhysical inactivity and obesity are strongly associated with the development of type 2 diabetes. People who are genetically susceptible to type 2 diabetes are more vulnerable when these risk factors are present.\n                \nAn imbalance between caloric intake and physical activity can lead to obesity, which causes insulin resistance and is common in people with type 2 diabetes. Central obesity, in which a person has excess abdominal fat, is a major risk factor not only for insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes but also for heart and blood vessel disease, also called cardiovascular disease (CVD). This excess belly fat produces hormones and other substances that can cause harmful, chronic effects in the body such as damage to blood vessels.\n                \nThe DPP and other studies show that millions of people can lower their risk for type 2 diabetes by making lifestyle changes and losing weight. The DPP proved that people with prediabetesat high risk of developing type 2 diabetescould sharply lower their risk by losing weight through regular physical activity and a diet low in fat and calories. In 2009, a follow-up study of DPP participantsthe Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study (DPPOS)showed that the benefits of weight loss lasted for at least 10 years after the original study began.2\n                \nRead more about the DPP, funded under National Institutes of Health (NIH) clinical trial number NCT00004992, and the DPPOS, funded under NIH clinical trial number NCT00038727 in  Diabetes Prevention Program.\n                \nInsulin Resistance\n                \nInsulin resistance is a common condition in people who are overweight or obese, have excess abdominal fat, and are not physically active. Muscle, fat, and liver cells stop responding properly to insulin, forcing the pancreas to compensate by producing extra insulin. As long as beta cells are able to produce enough insulin, blood glucose levels stay in the normal range. But when insulin production falters because of beta cell dysfunction, glucose levels rise, leading to prediabetes or diabetes.\n                \nAbnormal Glucose Production by the Liver\n                \nIn some people with diabetes, an abnormal increase in glucose production by the liver also contributes to high blood glucose levels. Normally, the pancreas releases the hormone glucagon when blood glucose and insulin levels are low. Glucagon stimulates the liver to produce glucose and release it into the bloodstream. But when blood glucose and insulin levels are high after a meal, glucagon levels drop, and the liver stores excess glucose for later, when it is needed. For reasons not completely understood, in many people with diabetes, glucagon levels stay higher than needed. High glucagon levels cause the liver to produce unneeded glucose, which contributes to high blood glucose levels. Metformin, the most commonly used drug to treat type 2 diabetes, reduces glucose production by the liver.\n                \nThe Roles of Insulin and Glucagon in Normal Blood Glucose Regulation\n                \nA healthy persons body keeps blood glucose levels in a normal range through several complex mechanisms. Insulin and glucagon, two hormones made in the pancreas, help regulate blood glucose levels:\n                \n- Insulin, made by beta cells, lowers elevated blood glucose levels.  - Glucagon, made by alpha cells, raises low blood glucose levels.\n                \n- Insulin helps muscle, fat, and liver cells absorb glucose from the bloodstream, lowering blood glucose levels.  - Insulin stimulates the liver and muscle tissue to store excess glucose. The stored form of glucose is called glycogen.  - Insulin also lowers blood glucose levels by reducing glucose production in the liver.\n                \n- Glucagon signals the liver and muscle tissue to break down glycogen into glucose, which enters the bloodstream and raises blood glucose levels.  - If the body needs more glucose, glucagon stimulates the liver to make glucose from amino acids.\n                \nMetabolic Syndrome\n                \nMetabolic syndrome, also called insulin resistance syndrome, refers to a group of conditions common in people with insulin resistance, including\n                \n- higher than normal blood glucose levels  - increased waist size due to excess abdominal fat  - high blood pressure  - abnormal levels of cholesterol and triglycerides in the blood\n                \nCell Signaling and Regulation\n                \nCells communicate through a complex network of molecular signaling pathways. For example, on cell surfaces, insulin receptor molecules capture, or bind, insulin molecules circulating in the bloodstream. This interaction between insulin and its receptor prompts the biochemical signals that enable the cells to absorb glucose from the blood and use it for energy.\n                \nProblems in cell signaling systems can set off a chain reaction that leads to diabetes or other diseases. Many studies have focused on how insulin signals cells to communicate and regulate action. Researchers have identified proteins and pathways that transmit the insulin signal and have mapped interactions between insulin and body tissues, including the way insulin helps the liver control blood glucose levels. Researchers have also found that key signals also come from fat cells, which produce substances that cause inflammation and insulin resistance.\n                \nThis work holds the key to combating insulin resistance and diabetes. As scientists learn more about cell signaling systems involved in glucose regulation, they will have more opportunities to develop effective treatments.\n                \nBeta Cell Dysfunction\n                \nScientists think beta cell dysfunction is a key contributor to type 2 diabetes. Beta cell impairment can cause inadequate or abnormal patterns of insulin release. Also, beta cells may be damaged by high blood glucose itself, a condition called glucose toxicity.\n                \nScientists have not determined the causes of beta cell dysfunction in most cases. Single gene defects lead to specific forms of diabetes called maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY). The genes involved regulate insulin production in the beta cells. Although these forms of diabetes are rare, they provide clues as to how beta cell function may be affected by key regulatory factors. Other gene variants are involved in determining the number and function of beta cells. But these variants account for only a small percentage of type 2 diabetes cases. Malnutrition early in life is also being investigated as a cause of beta cell dysfunction. The metabolic environment of the developing fetus may also create a predisposition for diabetes later in life.\n                \nRisk Factors for Type 2 Diabetes\n                \nPeople who develop type 2 diabetes are more likely to have the following characteristics:\n                \n- age 45 or older  - overweight or obese  - physically inactive  - parent or sibling with diabetes  - family background that is African American, Alaska Native, American Indian, Asian American, Hispanic/Latino, or Pacific Islander American  - history of giving birth to a baby weighing more than 9 pounds  - history of gestational diabetes  - high blood pressure140/90 or aboveor being treated for high blood pressure  - high-density lipoprotein (HDL), or good, cholesterol below 35 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL), or a triglyceride level above 250 mg/dL  - polycystic ovary syndrome, also called PCOS  - prediabetesan A1C level of 5.7 to 6.4 percent; a fasting plasma glucose test result of 100125 mg/dL, called impaired fasting glucose; or a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test result of 140199, called impaired glucose tolerance  - acanthosis nigricans, a condition associated with insulin resistance, characterized by a dark, velvety rash around the neck or armpits  - history of CVD\n                \nThe American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends that testing to detect prediabetes and type 2 diabetes be considered in adults who are overweight or obese and have one or more additional risk factors for diabetes. In adults without these risk factors, testing should begin at age 45.",

        "original_answer": "Insulin Resistance and Beta Cell Dysfunction\n                \nHormones produced by the placenta and other pregnancy-related factors contribute to insulin resistance, which occurs in all women during late pregnancy. Insulin resistance increases the amount of insulin needed to control blood glucose levels. If the pancreas cant produce enough insulin due to beta cell dysfunction, gestational diabetes occurs.\n                \nAs with type 2 diabetes, excess weight is linked to gestational diabetes. Overweight or obese women are at particularly high risk for gestational diabetes because they start pregnancy with a higher need for insulin due to insulin resistance. Excessive weight gain during pregnancy may also increase risk.\n                \nFamily History\n                \nHaving a family history of diabetes is also a risk factor for gestational diabetes, suggesting that genes play a role in its development.

These mutations are usually inherited, but sometimes the gene mutation occurs spontaneously. Most of these gene mutations cause diabetes by reducing beta cells ability to produce insulin.\n                \nThe most common types of monogenic diabetes are neonatal diabetes mellitus (NDM) and MODY. NDM occurs in the first 6 months of life. MODY is usually found during adolescence or early adulthood but sometimes is not diagnosed until later in life. More information about NDM and MODY is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Monogenic Forms of Diabetes.\n                \nOther rare genetic mutations can cause diabetes by damaging the quality of insulin the body produces or by causing abnormalities in insulin receptors.\n                \nOther Genetic Diseases\n                \nDiabetes occurs in people with Down syndrome, Klinefelter syndrome, and Turner syndrome at higher rates than the general population. Scientists are investigating whether genes that may predispose people to genetic syndromes also predispose them to diabetes.\n                \nThe genetic disorders cystic fibrosis and hemochromatosis are linked to diabetes. Cystic fibrosis produces abnormally thick mucus, which blocks the pancreas. The risk of diabetes increases with age in people with cystic fibrosis. Hemochromatosis causes the body to store too much iron. If the disorder is not treated, iron can build up in and damage the pancreas and other organs.\n                \nDamage to or Removal of the Pancreas\n                \nPancreatitis, cancer, and trauma can all harm the pancreatic beta cells or impair insulin production, thus causing diabetes. If the damaged pancreas is removed, diabetes will occur due to the loss of the beta cells.\n                \nEndocrine Diseases\n                \nEndocrine diseases affect organs that produce hormones. Cushings syndrome and acromegaly are examples of hormonal disorders that can cause prediabetes and diabetes by inducing insulin resistance. Cushings syndrome is marked by excessive production of cortisolsometimes called the stress hormone. Acromegaly occurs when the body produces too much growth hormone. Glucagonoma, a rare tumor of the pancreas, can also cause diabetes. The tumor causes the body to produce too much glucagon. Hyperthyroidism, a disorder that occurs when the thyroid gland produces too much thyroid hormone, can also cause elevated blood glucose levels.\n                \nAutoimmune Disorders\n                \nRare disorders characterized by antibodies that disrupt insulin action can lead to diabetes. This kind of diabetes is often associated with other autoimmune disorders such as lupus erythematosus. Another rare autoimmune disorder called stiff-man syndrome is associated with antibodies that attack the beta cells, similar to type 1 diabetes.\n                \nMedications and Chemical Toxins\n                \nSome medications, such as nicotinic acid and certain types of diuretics, anti-seizure drugs, psychiatric drugs, and drugs to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), can impair beta cells or disrupt insulin action. Pentamidine, a drug prescribed to treat a type of pneumonia, can increase the risk of pancreatitis, beta cell damage, and diabetes. Also, glucocorticoidssteroid hormones that are chemically similar to naturally produced cortisolmay impair insulin action. Glucocorticoids are used to treat inflammatory illnesses such as rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, lupus, and ulcerative colitis.\n                \nMany chemical toxins can damage or destroy beta cells in animals, but only a few have been linked to diabetes in humans. For example, dioxina contaminant of the herbicide Agent Orange, used during the Vietnam Warmay be linked to the development of type 2 diabetes. In 2000, based on a report from the Institute of Medicine, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) added diabetes to the list of conditions for which Vietnam veterans are eligible for disability compensation. Also, a chemical in a rat poison no longer in use has been shown to cause diabetes if ingested. Some studies suggest a high intake of nitrogen-containing chemicals such as nitrates and nitrites might increase the risk of diabetes. Arsenic has also been studied for possible links to diabetes.\n                \nLipodystrophy\n                \nLipodystrophy is a condition in which fat tissue is lost or redistributed in the body. The condition is associated with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.",

        "original_answer": "- Diabetes is a complex group of diseases with a variety of causes. Scientists believe genes and environmental factors interact to cause diabetes in most cases.  - People with diabetes have high blood glucose, also called high blood sugar or hyperglycemia. Diabetes develops when the body doesnt make enough insulin or is not able to use insulin effectively, or both.  - Insulin is a hormone made by beta cells in the pancreas. Insulin helps cells throughout the body absorb and use glucose for energy. If the body does not produce enough insulin or cannot use insulin effectively, glucose builds up in the blood instead of being absorbed by cells in the body, and the body is starved of energy.  - Prediabetes is a condition in which blood glucose levels or A1C levels are higher than normal but not high enough to be diagnosed as diabetes. People with prediabetes can substantially reduce their risk of developing diabetes by losing weight and increasing physical activity.  - The two main types of diabetes are type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. Gestational diabetes is a third form of diabetes that develops only during pregnancy.  - Type 1 diabetes is caused by a lack of insulin due to the destruction of insulin-producing beta cells. In type 1 diabetesan autoimmune diseasethe bodys immune system attacks and destroys the beta cells.  - Type 2 diabetesthe most common form of diabetesis caused by a combination of factors, including insulin resistance, a condition in which the bodys muscle, fat, and liver cells do not use insulin effectively. Type 2 diabetes develops when the body can no longer produce enough insulin to compensate for the impaired ability to use insulin.  - Scientists believe gestational diabetes is caused by the hormonal changes and metabolic demands of pregnancy together with genetic and environmental factors. Risk factors for gestational diabetes include being overweight and having a family history of diabetes.  - Monogenic forms of diabetes are relatively uncommon and are caused by mutations in single genes that limit insulin production, quality, or action in the body.  - Other types of diabetes are caused by diseases and injuries that damage the pancreas; certain chemical toxins and medications; infections; and other conditions.",

        "original_answer": "The kidneys are two bean-shaped organs, each about the size of a fist. They are located just below the rib cage, one on each side of the spine. Every day, the two kidneys filter about 120 to 150 quarts of blood to produce about 1 to 2 quarts of urine, composed of wastes and extra fluid. The urine flows from the kidneys to the bladder through tubes called ureters. The bladder stores urine.\n                \nWhen the bladder empties, urine flows out of the body through a tube called the urethra, located at the bottom of the bladder. In men the urethra is long, while in women it is short.\n                \nKidneys work at the microscopic level. The kidney is not one large filter. Each kidney is made up of about a million filtering units called nephrons. Each nephron filters a small amount of blood. The nephron includes a filter, called the glomerulus, and a tubule. The nephrons work through a two-step process. The glomerulus lets fluid and waste products pass through it; however, it prevents blood cells and large molecules, mostly proteins, from passing. The filtered fluid then passes through the tubule, which sends needed minerals back to the bloodstream and removes wastes. The final product becomes urine.",

Control your blood pressure: High blood pressure can cause further damage to the kidneys. Aim for a blood pressure of less than 130/80 mmHg.\n3. Maintain a healthy cholesterol level: High cholesterol can contribute to kidney damage. Keep your LDL (bad) cholesterol level below 100 mg/dL.\n4. Follow a healthy diet: Eating a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins can help manage your blood sugar, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels.\n5. Stay physically active: Regular exercise can help maintain a healthy weight, lower blood sugar levels, and reduce the risk of kidney disease.\n6. Avoid smoking and limit alcohol consumption: Both smoking and excessive alcohol consumption can increase the risk of kidney damage.\n7. Take prescribed medications as directed: Certain medications, such as ACE inhibitors and ARBs, can help protect the kidneys from further damage.\n\nBy following these steps, you can significantly reduce your risk of developing diabetic kidney disease. Regular check-ups with your doctor can also help monitor your kidney function and catch any potential issues early.",
        "original_answer": "People can prevent or slow the progression of diabetic kidney disease by\n                \n- taking medications to control high blood pressure  - managing blood glucose levels  - making changes in their eating, diet, and nutrition  - losing weight if they are overweight or obese  - getting regular physical activity\n                \nPeople with diabetes should see a health care provider who will help them learn to manage their diabetes and monitor their diabetes control. Most people with diabetes get care from primary care providers, including internists, family practice doctors, or pediatricians. However, having a team of health care providers can often improve diabetes care. In addition to a primary care provider, the team can include\n                \n- an endocrinologista doctor with special training in diabetes  - a nephrologista doctor who specializes in treating people who have kidney problems or related conditions  - diabetes educators such as a nurse or dietitian  - a podiatrista doctor who specializes in foot care  - an ophthalmologist or optometrist for eye care  - a pharmacist  - a dentist  - a mental health counselor for emotional support and access to community resources\n                \nThe team can also include other health care providers and specialists.\n                \nBlood Pressure Medications\n                \nMedications that lower blood pressure can also significantly slow the progression of kidney disease. Two types of blood pressure-lowering medications, angiotensinconverting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), have been shown to slow the progression of kidney disease. Many people require two or more medications to control their blood pressure. In addition to an ACE inhibitor or an ARB, a health care provider may prescribe a diuretica medication that helps the kidneys remove fluid from the blood. A person may also need beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and other blood pressure medications.\n                \nPeople should talk with their health care provider about their individual blood pressure goals and how often they should have their blood pressure checked.\n                \nManaging Blood Glucose Levels\n                \nPeople manage blood glucose levels by\n                \n- testing blood glucose throughout the day  - following a diet and physical activity plan  - taking insulin throughout the day based on food and liquid intake and physical activity\n                \nPeople with diabetes need to talk with their health care team regularly and follow their directions closely. The goal is to keep blood glucose levels within the normal range or within a range set by the persons health care team. More information about diabetes is provided in the NIDDK health topics:\n                \n- National Diabetes Statistics Report, 2014  - Diagnosis of Diabetes and Prediabetes\n                \nEating, Diet, and Nutrition\n                \nFollowing a healthy eating plan can help lower blood pressure and control blood sugar. A health care provider may recommend the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating plan. DASH focuses on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and other foods that are heart healthy and lower in sodium, which often comes from salt. The DASH eating plan\n                \n- is low in fat and cholesterol  - features fat-free or low-fat milk and dairy products, fish, poultry, and nuts  - suggests less red meat, and fewer sweets, added sugars, and sugarcontaining beverages  - is rich in nutrients, protein, and fiber\n                \nRead more about DASH at www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/dash.\n                \nPeople with diabetic kidney disease may need to limit sodium and salt intake to help reduce edema and lower blood pressure. A dietitian may also recommend a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol to help control high levels of lipids, or fats, in the blood.\n                \nHealth care providers may recommend that people with CKD eat moderate or reduced amounts of protein, though the benefits of reducing protein in a persons diet are still being researched. Proteins break down into waste products the kidneys must filter from the blood. Eating more protein than the body needs may burden the kidneys and cause kidney function to decline faster. However, protein intake that is too low may lead to malnutrition, a condition that occurs when the body does not get enough nutrients.

Overweight is defined as a body mass index (BMI)a measurement of weight in relation to heightof 25 to 29. A BMI of 30 or higher is considered obese. People should aim to keep their BMI lower than 25.4\n                \nExperts recommend physical activity as an important part of losing weight, keeping sensitivity to insulin, and treating high blood pressure. Most people should try to get at least 30 to 60 minutes of activity most or all days of the week. A person can do all physical activity at once or break up activities into shorter periods of at least 10 minutes each. Moderate activities include brisk walking, dancing, bowling, riding a bike, working in a garden, and cleaning the house.

The goals of treatment are to slow the progression of kidney damage, manage high blood pressure, control blood sugar levels, and prevent complications.\n\n1. Blood pressure control: Tight control of blood pressure is crucial in managing diabetic kidney disease. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are often prescribed, as they can help reduce protein in the urine and slow the progression of kidney damage.\n\n2. Blood sugar management: Maintaining good blood sugar control can help slow the progression of diabetic kidney disease. This typically involves a combination of lifestyle modifications, such as a healthy diet, regular exercise, and medication if necessary.\n\n3. Dietary changes: A low-protein, low-sodium diet may be recommended to help reduce the workload on the kidneys and control blood pressure.\n\n4. Cholesterol management: Statins or other cholesterol-lowering medications may be prescribed to help reduce the risk of cardiovascular complications, which are common in individuals with diabetic kidney disease.\n\n5. Diuretics: Diuretics may be used to help manage fluid buildup and swelling caused by kidney damage.\n\n6. Erythropoietin-stimulating agents (ESAs): These medications can help stimulate the production of red blood cells, which can be helpful in treating anemia, a common complication of diabetic kidney disease.\n\n7. Phosphate binders: Phosphate binders may be prescribed to help control high phosphate levels, which can contribute to the development of weak bones and calcification in blood vessels.\n\n8. Kidney transplant or dialysis: In severe cases of diabetic kidney disease, a kidney transplant or dialysis may be necessary to maintain kidney function.\n\nIt is essential to work closely with a healthcare provider to develop an individualized treatment plan based on the patient's specific needs and health status.",

        "original_answer": "- Diabetic kidney disease, also called diabetic nephropathy, is kidney disease caused by diabetes.  - People with diabetes have high blood glucose, also called high blood sugar or hyperglycemia.  - At the onset of diabetes, blood flow into the kidneys increases, which may strain the glomeruli and lessen their ability to filter blood.  - Higher levels of blood glucose lead to the buildup of extra material in the glomeruli, which increases the force of the blood moving through the kidneys and creates stress in the glomeruli.  - Many people with diabetes can develop high blood pressure, another factor in the development of kidney disease. High blood pressure, also called hypertension, is an increase in the amount of force that blood places on blood vessels as it moves through the entire body.  - Diabetic kidney disease takes many years to develop.  - People with diabetic kidney disease do not have any symptoms in the early stages. As kidney disease progresses, a person can develop edema, or swelling. Edema happens when the kidneys cannot get rid of the extra fluid and salt in the body. Edema can occur in the legs, feet, or ankles and less often in the hands or face.  - Once kidney function decreases further, symptoms may include      - appetite loss    - nausea    - vomiting    - drowsiness, or feeling tired    - trouble concentrating    - sleep problems    - increased or decreased urination    - generalized itching or numbness    - dry skin    - headaches    - weight loss    - darkened skin    - muscle cramps    - shortness of breath    - chest pain    - People can prevent or slow the progression of diabetic kidney disease by      - taking medication to control high blood pressure    - managing blood glucose levels    - making changes in their eating, diet, and nutrition    - losing weight if they are overweight or obese    - getting regular physical activity",

The doctor may also ask your sexual partner questions to get more information about the problem.\n                \nPhysical Exam\n                \nA physical exam can help your doctor find the cause of your ED. As part of the exam, the doctor will examine your testes and penis, take your blood pressure, and check for problems with your blood flow.\n                \nBlood Tests\n                \nA blood test involves drawing your blood at a doctors office or a commercial facility and sending the sample to a lab for analysis. Blood tests can show possible causes of ED, such as diabetes, clogged blood vessels, or chronic kidney disease. Low levels of testosterone in your blood can explain why you may have lost interest in sex.\n                \nNighttime Erection Test\n                \nDuring a nighttime erection test, you wear a plastic band around your penis to test whether you have nighttime erections. The band easily breaks if your penis expands. This test shows if you had at least one erection during the night. Another test uses an electronic device that can record the number of erections, how long they last, and how firm they are. A man normally has three to five erections during the night while he sleeps. If you do have an erection, it probably means that your ED is more likely a mental health issue. If you do not have these erections, you probably have nerve damage or poor blood flow to your penis. You may do this test in your home or in a special sleep lab.\n                \nInjection Test\n                \nDuring an injection test, the doctor will inject a medicine into your penis to cause an erection. If the erection is not firm or does not last, it may mean you have a problem with blood flow. This test most often takes place in the doctors office.\n                \nDoppler Penile Ultrasound\n                \nAn x-ray technician most often performs a Doppler penile ultrasound in a doctors office or an outpatient center. During a Doppler penile ultrasound, the x-ray technician or doctor lightly passes a device over your penis to create images of blood vessels in your penis. An injection is used to create an erection. The images can show if you have a blood flow problem. The pictures appear on a computer screen. A radiologista doctor who specializes in medical imaginglooks at the images to find possible problems.",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Erectile dysfunction (ED) can be treated in several ways, depending on the underlying cause. Here are some common treatment options:\n\n1. Lifestyle changes: Making lifestyle changes such as exercising regularly, quitting smoking, reducing alcohol consumption, and managing stress can help improve ED.\n2. Medications: Medications such as sildenafil (Viagra), tadalafil (Cialis), and vardenafil (Levitra) can help improve blood flow to the penis and improve erections.\n3. Hormone therapy: If ED is caused by low testosterone levels, hormone replacement therapy may be recommended.\n4. Psychological counseling: If ED is caused by stress, anxiety, or depression, counseling may be recommended to help address these underlying issues.\n5. Vacuum constriction devices: These devices can be used to draw blood into the penis and create an erection.\n6. Penile injections: Medications can be injected directly into the penis to improve blood flow and cause an erection.\n7. Penile implants: In some cases, a penile implant may be recommended as a last resort. This involves surgically implanting a device that can be inflated to create an erection.\n\nIt's important to consult with a healthcare provider to determine the underlying cause of ED and develop an appropriate treatment plan.",
        "original_answer": "Your doctor can offer you a number of treatments for ED. For many men, the answer is as simple as taking a pill. Other men have to try two or three options before they find a treatment that works for them. Dont give up if the first treatment doesnt work. Finding the right treatment can take time. You may want to talk with your sexual partner about which treatment fits you best as a couple.\n                \nA doctor can treat ED by\n                \n- treating the cause of your ED:      - lifestyle changes    - changing the medicines you take to treat other health problems    - counseling    - prescribing medicines to treat your ED:      - medicine by mouth    - other forms of medicine    - prescribing a vacuum device  - performing surgery:      - implanted devices    - surgery to repair blood vessels\n                \nTreating the Cause of Your Erectile Dysfunction\n                \nThe first step is to treat any health problems that may be causing your ED. Untreated diabetes or high blood pressure may be part of the cause of your ED.\n                \nLifestyle changes. For some men, the following lifestyle changes help:\n                \n- quitting smoking  - drinking less alcohol  - increasing physical activity  - stopping illegal drug use\n                \nChanging medicines you take to treat other health problems. Talk with your doctor about all the medicines you are taking, including over-the-counter medicines. The doctor may find that a medicine you are taking is causing your ED. Your doctor may be able to give you another medicine that works in a different way, or your doctor may tell you to try a lower dose of your medicine.\n                \nCounseling. Counseling can help couples deal with the emotional effects of ED. Some couples find that counseling adds to the medical treatment by making their relationship stronger.\n                \nPrescribing Medicines to Treat Your Erectile Dysfunction\n                \nDepending on which medicine your doctor gives you, you may take it by mouth or by putting it directly into your penis.\n                \nMedicine by mouth. Your doctor may be able to prescribe a pill to treat ED. Common medicines include\n                \n- sildenafil (Viagra)  - vardenafil (Levitra, Staxyn)  - tadalafil (Cialis)  - avanafil (Stendra)\n                \nIf your health is generally good, your doctor may prescribe one of these medicines. You should not take any of these pills to treat ED if you take any nitrates, a type of heart medicine. All ED pills work by increasing blood flow to the penis. They do not cause automatic erections. Talk with your doctor about when to take the pill. You may need to experiment to find out how soon the pill takes effect.\n                \nOther forms of medicine. Taking a pill doesnt work for all men. You may need to use medicine that goes directly into your penis. You may use an injection into the shaft of your penis, or you may use medicine placed in your urethra, at the tip of your penis. The urethra is the tube that carries urine and semen outside of the body. Your doctor will teach you how to use the medicines. They most often cause an erection within minutes. These medicines can be successful, even if other treatments fail.\n                \nPrescribing a Vacuum Device\n                \nAnother way to create an erection is to use a device with a specially designed vacuum tube. You put your penis into the tube, which is connected to a pump. As air is pumped out of the tube, blood flows into your penis and makes it larger and firmer. You then move a specially designed elastic ring from the end of the tube to the base of your penis to keep the blood from flowing back into your body. You may find that using a vacuum device requires some practice.\n                \nPerforming Surgery\n                \nIf the other options fail, you may need surgery to treat ED.\n                \nImplanted devices. A urologist can place a device that fills with fluid or a device with bendable rods inside the penis to create an erection.\n                \nOne kind of implant uses two cylinders that fill with fluid like a balloon. Tubing connects the cylinders to a small ball that holds the fluid. You fill the cylinders by squeezing a small pump that the urologist places under the skin of the scrotum, in front of your testes. The pump causes fluid to flow into the two cylinders in your penis, making it hard. The fluid can make the penis slightly longer and wider. An implant that uses fluids instead of bendable rods leaves the penis in a more natural state when not in use.\n                \nImplants that bend most often have two rods that the urologist places side by side in your penis during surgery. You use your hands to adjust the position of the rods to make your penis straight. Your penis does not get larger. After sex, you bend the rods down.\n                \nImplanted devices do not affect the way sex feels or the ability to have an orgasm.\n                \nOnce you have an implanted device, you must use the device to have an erection every time. Talk with your doctor about the pros and cons of having an implanted device.\n                \nSurgery to repair blood vessels. Doctors treat some cases of ED with surgery to repair the blood vessels that carry blood to the penis. This type of surgery is more likely to work in men younger than 30.",

Each type has its specific modes of transmission, symptoms, and prevention methods.\n\n1. Hepatitis A (HAV) is an acute, short-term infection caused by the Hepatitis A virus. It is commonly transmitted through contaminated food, water, or direct contact with an infected person. Vaccination is available for prevention.\n2. Hepatitis B (HBV) is an acute or chronic infection caused by the Hepatitis B virus. It is primarily transmitted through contact with infected blood, semen, or other bodily fluids, as well as from mother to child during childbirth. A vaccine is available for prevention.\n3. Hepatitis C (HCV) is a bloodborne, chronic infection caused by the Hepatitis C virus. It is primarily transmitted through sharing needles, syringes, or other equipment used to inject drugs, as well as through transfusions of unscreened blood or blood products. No vaccine is currently available for HCV, but treatments can cure most infections.\n4. Hepatitis D (HDV) is a rare, bloodborne, and often chronic infection caused by the Hepatitis D virus. It only affects people who are already infected with HBV. HDV is transmitted through contact with infected blood, semen, or other bodily fluids. A vaccine for HBV also provides protection against HDV.\n5. Hepatitis E (HEV) is a short-term, acute infection caused by the Hepatitis E virus.

        "original_answer": "Hepatitis B may start as a brief, flu-like illness. Most healthy adults and children older than 5 completely recover after the bodys immune system gets rid of the virus.\n                \nHepatitis B becomes chronic when the bodys immune system cant get rid of the virus. Over time, having the virus can lead to inflammation of the liver; scar tissue in the liver, called cirrhosis; or liver cancer. Inflammation is the painful red swelling that results when tissues of the body become infected. Young children and people with weakened immune systems are especially at risk.

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Goodpasture syndrome is a rare autoimmune disease that affects the kidneys and lungs. It occurs when the body's immune system produces antibodies that attack and damage the basement membrane, a thin layer of tissue that lines the inside of blood vessels in the lungs and kidneys. This damage can lead to inflammation, bleeding, and scarring in the lungs and kidneys, causing symptoms such as coughing up blood, shortness of breath, and kidney failure. Goodpasture syndrome is typically treated with medications that suppress the immune system and reduce inflammation. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial for improving the chances of a full recovery.",
        "original_answer": "Goodpasture syndrome is a pulmonary-renal syndrome, which is a group of acute illnesses involving the kidneys and lungs. Goodpasture syndrome includes all of the following conditions:\n                \n- glomerulonephritisinflammation of the glomeruli, which are tiny clusters of looping blood vessels in the kidneys that help filter wastes and extra water from the blood  - the presence of anti-glomerular basement membrane (GBM) antibodies; the GBM is part of the glomeruli and is composed of collagen and other proteins  - bleeding in the lungs\n                \nIn Goodpasture syndrome, immune cells produce antibodies against a specific region of collagen. The antibodies attack the collagen in the lungs and kidneys.\n                \nErnest Goodpasture first described the syndrome during the influenza pandemic of 1919 when he reported on a patient who died from bleeding in the lungs and kidney failure. Diagnostic tools to confirm Goodpasture syndrome were not available at that time, so it is not known whether the patient had true Goodpasture syndrome or vasculitis. Vasculitis is an autoimmune conditiona disorder in which the bodys immune system attacks the bodys own cells and organsthat involves inflammation in the blood vessels and can cause similar lung and kidney problems.\n                \nGoodpasture syndrome is sometimes called anti-GBM disease. However, anti-GBM disease is only one cause of pulmonary-renal syndromes, including Goodpasture syndrome.\n                \nGoodpasture syndrome is fatal unless quickly diagnosed and treated.",

Urine tests: These can reveal protein and blood in the urine, which are signs of kidney damage.\n\n3. Imaging tests: A chest X-ray or CT scan can show if there is inflammation or bleeding in the lungs.\n\n4. Kidney biopsy: This is often done to confirm the diagnosis and assess the severity of the kidney damage. The biopsy will show if there is inflammation and antibody deposits in the kidney's filtering system.\n\n5. Lung biopsy: If there are signs of lung involvement but the chest X-ray or CT scan is not conclusive, a lung biopsy may be done to look for inflammation and antibody deposits in the lungs.\n\nIt's important to note that a diagnosis should be made by a healthcare professional. If you suspect you have Goodpasture syndrome, you should seek medical attention immediately.",
        "original_answer": "A health care provider may order the following tests to diagnose Goodpasture syndrome:\n                \n- Urinalysis. Urinalysis is testing of a urine sample. The urine sample is collected in a special container in a health care providers office or commercial facility and can be tested in the same location or sent to a lab for analysis. For the test, a nurse or technician places a strip of chemically treated paper, called a dipstick, into the urine. Patches on the dipstick change color when protein or blood are present in urine. A high number of red blood cells and high levels of protein in the urine indicate kidney damage.  - Blood test. A blood test involves drawing blood at a health care providers office or commercial facility and sending the sample to a lab for analysis. The blood test can show the presence of anti-GBM antibodies.  - Chest x ray. An x ray of the chest is performed in a health care providers office, outpatient center, or hospital by an x-ray technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologista doctor who specializes in medical imaging. Abnormalities in the lungs, if present, can be seen on the x ray.  - Biopsy. A biopsy is a procedure that involves taking a piece of kidney tissue for examination with a microscope. The biopsy is performed by a health care provider in a hospital with light sedation and local anesthetic. The health care provider uses imaging techniques such as ultrasound or a computerized tomography scan to guide the biopsy needle into the kidney. The tissue is examined in a lab by a pathologista doctor who specializes in diagnosing diseases. The test can show crescent-shaped changes in the glomeruli and lines of antibodies attached to the GBM.",

Corticosteroids: These medications help reduce inflammation in the lungs and kidneys.\n2. Immunosuppressive drugs: These medications suppress the immune system and prevent it from attacking the body's own tissues.\n3. Cyclophosphamide: This is a strong immunosuppressive drug that can help prevent further kidney damage.\n4. Plasmapheresis: This procedure involves removing the patient's blood, separating the plasma (which contains the antibodies that attack the body's tissues), and then returning the blood to the patient's body.\n5. Blood pressure medication: This helps control high blood pressure, which is a common complication of Goodpasture syndrome.\n6. Dialysis or kidney transplant: In severe cases where the kidneys are severely damaged, dialysis or a kidney transplant may be necessary.\n\nIt's important to note that treatment for Goodpasture syndrome is highly individualized and depends on the severity of the disease and the patient's overall health.

        "original_answer": "You have two kidneys. The kidneys are shaped like beans. Each kidney is about the size of a fist. They are located just below your ribcage, one on each side of your spine. Your kidneys filter your blood. Each kidney is made of 1 million little filters. During every minute of every day, these filters take out waste materials that can hurt you. They also take out extra fluid from your blood. The wastes and extra fluid make urine. The urine flows from your kidneys to your bladder through tubes called ureters.The bladder stores urine until you urinate. Then, urine leaves the body through a tube called the urethra.\n                \n*See the Pronunciation Guide for tips on how to say the the words in bold type.",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Kidney failure, also known as renal failure, occurs when the kidneys lose their ability to effectively filter waste and excess fluids from the body. This can be caused by various conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure, kidney inflammation, inherited diseases, or acute damage due to factors like trauma or drug use.\n\nThere are two types of kidney failure: acute and chronic. Acute kidney failure happens suddenly and can be reversible, while chronic kidney failure develops gradually over time and may lead to permanent kidney damage.\n\nSymptoms of kidney failure may include:\n\n1. Swelling in the legs, ankles, and feet due to fluid retention\n2. Shortness of breath\n3. Fatigue and weakness\n4. Decreased urine output or frequent urination, especially at night\n5. Loss of appetite and nausea\n6. Confusion and difficulty concentrating\n\nTreatment for kidney failure depends on the underlying cause and severity of the condition. The main goals of treatment are to preserve remaining kidney function, manage symptoms, and prevent complications. Some common treatment options include:\n\n1. Controlling the underlying cause: Managing conditions like diabetes and high blood pressure can help slow the progression of kidney damage.\n2. Medication: Diuretics can help control fluid buildup, while medications like ACE inhibitors and ARBs can lower blood pressure and protect the kidneys.\n3. Dialysis: A treatment that uses a machine to filter waste and excess fluids from the blood when the kidneys can no longer perform this function effectively. There are two main types of dialysis: hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis.\n4. Kidney transplant: A surgical procedure to replace a failing kidney with a healthy one from a donor. This is typically considered when kidney function is significantly impaired and dialysis is no longer sufficient.\n\nPreventing kidney failure involves maintaining a healthy lifestyle, controlling underlying conditions, and monitoring kidney function regularly. This can help reduce the risk of kidney damage and ensure early intervention if any issues arise.",

        "original_answer": "Hemodialysis is a treatment for kidney failure that is done in a center several times per week. Some people learn to do hemodialysis in their homes. Hemodialysis uses a machine to filter your blood when your kidneys are too sick to filter any more. With hemodialysis, your blood is filtered outside of your body. Unfiltered blood is removed from the body and flows to the dialyzer to be cleaned. Filtered blood flows back to the body. First, a dialysis nurse places two needles into your arm. A pump on the hemodialysis machine draws your blood through one of the needles into a tube. The tube takes the blood to a filter, called a dialyzer. Inside the dialyzer, your blood flows through thin fibers that are like straws. The wastes and extra fluid leave the blood through tiny holes in the fibers. Then, a different tube carries the filtered blood back to your body through the second needle. The hemodialysis machine throws out the wastes and extra fluid, just like how your body makes urine. Hemodialysis does not make the kidneys better. However, it may help you feel better by filtering your blood when your kidneys fail.",

        "original_answer": "Peritoneal dialysis uses the lining of your belly to filter your blood inside your body. You can do peritoneal dialysis at home because it uses your body to filter. A doctor will place a soft tube called a catheter in your belly a few weeks before you start treatment. The catheter stays in your belly permanently.\n                \nThe catheter lets you put a kind of salty water from a plastic bag into your belly. Then, you can move around and go about your day. While the salty water is inside your belly, it soaks up wastes and extra fluid from your body. After a few hours, you drain the salty water from your belly into a drain bag. The salty water removes wastes and extra fluid from your body. The salty water can be thrown away into a toilet or tub. Then you start over with a fresh bag of salty water. You will empty and fill your belly four to six times a day.\n                \nThe salty water is always in your belly soaking up wastes and extra fluid.

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "I understand you're looking for information about kidney failure and its treatment. Kidney failure, also known as renal failure, occurs when your kidneys lose their ability to effectively filter waste and excess fluid from your blood. This can lead to a buildup of toxins in your body and may cause serious health complications.\n\nThere are two main types of kidney failure: acute and chronic.\n\n1. Acute kidney failure: This is a sudden loss of kidney function that happens over a few hours or a few days. It can be caused by various factors such as infections, dehydration, severe injuries, or complications from surgeries. Acute kidney failure is often reversible with proper treatment.\n2. Chronic kidney disease (CKD): This is a gradual loss of kidney function that occurs over several months or years. The most common causes of CKD are diabetes and high blood pressure. Chronic kidney disease can progress to kidney failure if left untreated.\n\nTreatment for kidney failure depends on the underlying cause, the severity of the condition, and the presence of any complications. Here are some common treatment options:\n\n1. Medications: Depending on the cause of kidney failure, your doctor may prescribe medications to treat infections, manage high blood pressure, or control blood sugar levels.\n2. Dialysis: This is a process that removes waste and excess fluid from your blood when your kidneys can no longer do so effectively. There are two main types of dialysis: hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis.\n3. Kidney transplant: In some cases, a kidney transplant may be an option for people with end-stage kidney failure. This involves surgically placing a healthy donor kidney into your body.\n4. Lifestyle changes: Making certain lifestyle changes can help slow the progression of kidney disease and manage its symptoms. These changes may include following a healthy diet, staying physically active, quitting smoking, and limiting alcohol consumption.\n\nIt's essential to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment options if you suspect you have kidney failure. Early detection and treatment can significantly improve your prognosis and help prevent further kidney damage.",
        "original_answer": "Eating healthy foods can help you keep up your energy and strength. All dialysis and transplant centers have a dietitian. The dietitian helps people with kidney failure learn about healthy food choices. You should talk with your centers dietitian to make a meal plan.\n                \nThe best diet for you will depend on which kidney failure treatment you choose after talking with your doctor.\n                \n- Hemodialysis      - Limit how much liquid and water you drink. Fluid can build up in your body between hemodialysis sessions. Also, many foods contain water. The extra fluid in your body can cause swelling and high blood pressure. Extra fluid in your body makes your heart work harder.\n                \n-      - Limit sodium, or salt. Watch out for sodium in frozen foods and prepared meals. You can also find sodium in canned foods, hot dogs, and fast food. Sodium makes you thirsty, which makes you drink more water and other liquids than you should.    - Read more in the National Kidney Disease Education Program (NKDEP) fact sheet Sodium.    - Limit potassium. Potassium is found in many fruits and vegetables such as potatoes, tomatoes, oranges, and bananas. Too much potassium can make your heart beat unevenly. Hemodialysis does not remove potassium from your body well.    - Read more in the NKDEP fact sheet Potassium.    - Eat protein-rich foods such as meat, fish, and eggs. Hemodialysis removes protein from your body.    - Read more in the NKDEP fact sheet Protein.    - Limit phosphorus. Phosphorus helps your bones, blood vessels, and muscles work.    - However, too much phosphorus can make your bones weak. Limiting phosphorus can be hard. Foods that contain phosphorus, such as meat and milk, also contain protein that you need. You should be careful to eat enough protein, yet not so much that you get too much phosphorus. You can avoid other foods that contain phosphorus, such as cola, tea, beans, and nuts.    - Read more in the NKDEP fact sheet Phosphorus.    - Find healthy ways to add calories to your diet. Calories are found in all foods and give your body energy. Many people on hemodialysis do not have a good appetite and do not get enough calories. Vegetable oils are good sources of calories. Vegetable oils include olive oil, canola oil, and safflower oil. Use them on breads, rice, and noodles. Hard candy, sugar, honey, jam, and jelly provide calories and energy. However, if you have diabetes, speak with your doctor or dietitian before eating extra sweets.    - More information about nutrition for people who are on hemodialysis is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Eat Right to Feel Right on Hemodialysis.    - Peritoneal dialysis      - Drink as much water and other liquids as you need. If you are holding too much fluid or too little fluid, your doctor needs to know.    - Limit sodium to control your thirst and help prevent heart problems. You can use spices other than salt to flavor your food.\n                \n-      - You may need to eat more potassium-rich foods. Peritoneal dialysis removes potassium from your body. Talk with your doctor or dietitian about the right amount of potassium for you.    - Eat protein-rich foods. Peritoneal dialysis removes even more protein from your body than hemodialysis.    - Limit phosphorus to keep your bones strong.    - You may need to limit your calorie intake. The salty water also contains some sugar. Your body absorbs the sugar, which can cause you to gain weight.    - Kidney transplant      - Limit sodium to help prevent heart problems.    - You should be able to eat normal amounts of phosphorus and potassium. You may need to adjust the amounts if blood tests show a problem.\n                \n-      - Eat protein-rich foods to repair muscle breakdown and protect against infection.    - You may need to limit your calories. The medicines you take can make you gain weight.    - Conservative management      - Limit protein to prevent the buildup of wastes in your blood.\n                \nYou may have other needs and limits, depending on how well your treatments work.",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "I understand that you're looking for information about kidney failure and its treatment.\n\nKidney failure, also known as renal failure, occurs when your kidneys lose their ability to effectively filter waste and excess fluids from your blood. This can lead to a buildup of toxins in your body, which can cause a variety of symptoms, such as fatigue, weakness, shortness of breath, and swelling in your legs and ankles.\n\nThere are two main types of kidney failure: acute and chronic.\n\n* Acute kidney failure happens suddenly, often as a result of an illness or injury, and can usually be reversed with treatment.\n* Chronic kidney failure, on the other hand, develops slowly over time and is often caused by conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, or kidney disease. Chronic kidney failure can lead to end-stage kidney failure, which requires dialysis or a kidney transplant to survive.\n\nTreatment for kidney failure depends on the underlying cause and severity of the condition. In general, treatment may include:\n\n* Managing the underlying cause: For example, if your kidney failure is caused by diabetes, controlling your blood sugar levels can help slow the progression of the condition.\n* Making lifestyle changes: This may include following a healthy diet, getting regular exercise, and quitting smoking.\n* Taking medications: Depending on your condition, your doctor may prescribe medications to help manage your symptoms and protect your kidneys.\n* Dialysis: If your kidneys are no longer able to filter waste and excess fluids from your blood, you may need to undergo dialysis. There are two main types of dialysis: hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis.\n* Kidney transplant: If your kidneys have failed and dialysis is not an option, a kidney transplant may be necessary.\n\nIt's important to work closely with your healthcare provider to develop a treatment plan that's right for you. If you have any concerns about your kidney health, be sure to speak with your doctor.",
        "original_answer": "- Kidney failure means your kidneys no longer filter your blood well enough to keep you healthy.  - The treatments for kidney failure are      - hemodialysis    - peritoneal dialysis    - a kidney transplant    - conservative management    - Hemodialysis uses a machine to filter your blood when your kidneys are too sick to filter any more.  - Peritoneal dialysis uses the lining of your belly to filter your blood inside your body.  - A kidney transplant places a healthy kidney from another person into your body.  - Conservative management means your doctors take care of you without dialysis or a transplant. The doctors may give you medicines that make you feel more comfortable.  - All dialysis and transplant centers have a dietitian. The dietitian helps people with kidney failure learn about healthy food choices.",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Glomerular diseases, which affect the kidney's filtration system called glomeruli, can be caused by various factors. They can be inherited or develop due to other medical conditions, such as:\n\n1. Diabetes: Both type 1 and type 2 diabetes can cause damage to the glomeruli over time, leading to a condition known as diabetic nephropathy.\n2. High blood pressure: Uncontrolled hypertension can damage the blood vessels in the kidneys, including the glomeruli.\n3. Infections: Some infections, like HIV, hepatitis, and malaria, can lead to glomerular diseases.\n4. Immune system disorders: Conditions such as lupus, Goodpasture's syndrome, and IgA nephropathy involve an abnormal immune response that can affect the glomeruli.\n5. Genetic factors: Certain glomerular diseases, like Alport syndrome and thin basement membrane disease, are inherited and present from birth or early childhood.\n6. Exposure to toxins or medications: Prolonged exposure to certain toxins or medications, such as analgesics and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), can cause glomerular damage.\n\nIt is essential to consult a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment if you suspect glomerular disease.",
        "original_answer": "A number of different diseases can result in glomerular disease. It may be the direct result of an infection or a drug toxic to the kidneys, or it may result from a disease that affects the entire body, like diabetes or lupus. Many different kinds of diseases can cause swelling or scarring of the nephron or glomerulus. Sometimes glomerular disease is idiopathic, meaning that it occurs without an apparent associated disease.\n                \nThe categories presented below can overlap: that is, a disease might belong to two or more of the categories. For example, diabetic nephropathy is a form of glomerular disease that can be placed in two categories: systemic diseases, since diabetes itself is a systemic disease, and sclerotic diseases, because the specific damage done to the kidneys is associated with scarring.\n                \nAutoimmune Diseases\n                \nWhen the body's immune system functions properly, it creates protein-like substances called antibodies and immunoglobulins to protect the body against invading organisms. In an autoimmune disease, the immune system creates autoantibodies, which are antibodies or immunoglobulins that attack the body itself. Autoimmune diseases may be systemic and affect many parts of the body, or they may affect only specific organs or regions.\n                \nSystemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) affects many parts of the body: primarily the skin and joints, but also the kidneys. Because women are more likely to develop SLE than men, some researchers believe that a sex-linked genetic factor may play a part in making a person susceptible, although viral infection has also been implicated as a triggering factor. Lupus nephritis is the name given to the kidney disease caused by SLE, and it occurs when autoantibodies form or are deposited in the glomeruli, causing inflammation. Ultimately, the inflammation may create scars that keep the kidneys from functioning properly. Conventional treatment for lupus nephritis includes a combination of two drugs, cyclophosphamide, a cytotoxic agent that suppresses the immune system, and prednisolone, a corticosteroid used to reduce inflammation. A newer immunosuppressant, mychophenolate mofetil (MMF), has been used instead of cyclophosphamide. Preliminary studies indicate that MMF may be as effective as cyclophosphamide and has milder side effects.\n                \nGoodpasture's Syndrome involves an autoantibody that specifically targets the kidneys and the lungs. Often, the first indication that patients have the autoantibody is when they cough up blood. But lung damage in Goodpasture's Syndrome is usually superficial compared with progressive and permanent damage to the kidneys. Goodpasture's Syndrome is a rare condition that affects mostly young men but also occurs in women, children, and older adults. Treatments include immunosuppressive drugs and a blood-cleaning therapy called plasmapheresis that removes the autoantibodies.\n                \nIgA nephropathy is a form of glomerular disease that results when immunoglobulin A (IgA) forms deposits in the glomeruli, where it creates inflammation. IgA nephropathy was not recognized as a cause of glomerular disease until the late 1960s, when sophisticated biopsy techniques were developed that could identify IgA deposits in kidney tissue.\n                \nThe most common symptom of IgA nephropathy is blood in the urine, but it is often a silent disease that may go undetected for many years. The silent nature of the disease makes it difficult to determine how many people are in the early stages of IgA nephropathy, when specific medical tests are the only way to detect it. This disease is estimated to be the most common cause of primary glomerulonephritisthat is, glomerular disease not caused by a systemic disease like lupus or diabetes mellitus. It appears to affect men more than women. Although IgA nephropathy is found in all age groups, young people rarely display signs of kidney failure because the disease usually takes several years to progress to the stage where it causes detectable complications.\n                \nNo treatment is recommended for early or mild cases of IgA nephropathy when the patient has normal blood pressure and less than 1 gram of protein in a 24-hour urine output. When proteinuria exceeds 1 gram/day, treatment is aimed at protecting kidney function by reducing proteinuria and controlling blood pressure. Blood pressure medicinesangiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)that block a hormone called angiotensin are most effective at achieving those two goals simultaneously.\n                \n\n                \nHereditary NephritisAlport Syndrome\n                \nThe primary indicator of Alport syndrome is a family history of chronic glomerular disease, although it may also involve hearing or vision impairment. This syndrome affects both men and women, but men are more likely to experience chronic kidney disease and sensory loss. Men with Alport syndrome usually first show evidence of renal insufficiency while in their twenties and reach total kidney failure by age 40. Women rarely have significant renal impairment, and hearing loss may be so slight that it can be detected only through testing with special equipment. Usually men can pass the disease only to their daughters. Women can transmit the disease to either their sons or their daughters. Treatment focuses on controlling blood pressure to maintain kidney function.\n                \nInfection-related Glomerular Disease\n                \nGlomerular disease sometimes develops rapidly after an infection in other parts of the body. Acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN) can occur after an episode of strep throat or, in rare cases, impetigo (a skin infection). The Streptococcus bacteria do not attack the kidney directly, but an infection may stimulate the immune system to overproduce antibodies, which are circulated in the blood and finally deposited in the glomeruli, causing damage. PSGN can bring on sudden symptoms of swelling (edema), reduced urine output (oliguria), and blood in the urine (hematuria). Tests will show large amounts of protein in the urine and elevated levels of creatinine and urea nitrogen in the blood, thus indicating reduced kidney function. High blood pressure frequently accompanies reduced kidney function in this disease.\n                \nPSGN is most common in children between the ages of 3 and 7, although it can strike at any age, and it most often affects boys. It lasts only a brief time and usually allows the kidneys to recover. In a few cases, however, kidney damage may be permanent, requiring dialysis or transplantation to replace renal function.\n                \nBacterial endocarditis, infection of the tissues inside the heart, is also associated with subsequent glomerular disease. Researchers are not sure whether the renal lesions that form after a heart infection are caused entirely by the immune response or whether some other disease mechanism contributes to kidney damage. Treating the heart infection is the most effective way of minimizing kidney damage. Endocarditis sometimes produces chronic kidney disease (CKD).\n                \nHIV, the virus that leads to AIDS, can also cause glomerular disease. Between 5 and 10 percent of people with HIV experience kidney failure, even before developing full-blown AIDS. HIV-associated nephropathy usually begins with heavy proteinuria and progresses rapidly (within a year of detection) to total kidney failure. Researchers are looking for therapies that can slow down or reverse this rapid deterioration of renal function, but some possible solutions involving immunosuppression are risky because of the patients' already compromised immune system.\n                \nSclerotic Diseases\n                \nGlomerulosclerosis is scarring (sclerosis) of the glomeruli. In several sclerotic conditions, a systemic disease like lupus or diabetes is responsible. Glomerulosclerosis is caused by the activation of glomerular cells to produce scar material. This may be stimulated by molecules called growth factors, which may be made by glomerular cells themselves or may be brought to the glomerulus by the circulating blood that enters the glomerular filter.\n                \nDiabetic nephropathy is the leading cause of glomerular disease and of total kidney failure in the United States. Kidney disease is one of several problems caused by elevated levels of blood glucose, the central feature of diabetes. In addition to scarring the kidney, elevated glucose levels appear to increase the speed of blood flow into the kidney, putting a strain on the filtering glomeruli and raising blood pressure.\n                \nDiabetic nephropathy usually takes many years to develop. People with diabetes can slow down damage to their kidneys by controlling their blood glucose through healthy eating with moderate protein intake, physical activity, and medications. People with diabetes should also be careful to keep their blood pressure at a level below 140/90 mm Hg, if possible. Blood pressure medications called ACE inhibitors and ARBs are particularly effective at minimizing kidney damage and are now frequently prescribed to control blood pressure in patients with diabetes and in patients with many forms of kidney disease.\n                \nFocal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) describes scarring in scattered regions of the kidney, typically limited to one part of the glomerulus and to a minority of glomeruli in the affected region. FSGS may result from a systemic disorder or it may develop as an idiopathic kidney disease, without a known cause. Proteinuria is the most common symptom of FSGS, but, since proteinuria is associated with several other kidney conditions, the doctor cannot diagnose FSGS on the basis of proteinuria alone. Biopsy may confirm the presence of glomerular scarring if the tissue is taken from the affected section of the kidney. But finding the affected section is a matter of chance, especially early in the disease process, when lesions may be scattered.\n                \nConfirming a diagnosis of FSGS may require repeat kidney biopsies. Arriving at a diagnosis of idiopathic FSGS requires the identification of focal scarring and the elimination of possible systemic causes such as diabetes or an immune response to infection. Since idiopathic FSGS is, by definition, of unknown cause, it is difficult to treat. No universal remedy has been found, and most patients with FSGS progress to total kidney failure over 5 to 20 years. Some patients with an aggressive form of FSGS reach total kidney failure in 2 to 3 years. Treatments involving steroids or other immunosuppressive drugs appear to help some patients by decreasing proteinuria and improving kidney function. But these treatments are beneficial to only a minority of those in whom they are tried, and some patients experience even poorer kidney function as a result. ACE inhibitors and ARBs may also be used in FSGS to decrease proteinuria. Treatment should focus on controlling blood pressure and blood cholesterol levels, factors that may contribute to kidney scarring.\n                \nOther Glomerular Diseases\n                \nMembranous nephropathy, also called membranous glomerulopathy, is the second most common cause of the nephrotic syndrome (proteinuria, edema, high cholesterol) in U.S. adults after diabetic nephropathy. Diagnosis of membranous nephropathy requires a kidney biopsy, which reveals unusual deposits of immunoglobulin G and complement C3, substances created by the body's immune system. Fully 75 percent of cases are idiopathic, which means that the cause of the disease is unknown. The remaining 25 percent of cases are the result of other diseases like systemic lupus erythematosus, hepatitis B or C infection, or some forms of cancer. Drug therapies involving penicillamine, gold, or captopril have also been associated with membranous nephropathy. About 20 to 40 percent of patients with membranous nephropathy progress, usually over decades, to total kidney failure, but most patients experience either complete remission or continued symptoms without progressive kidney failure. Doctors disagree about how aggressively to treat this condition, since about 20 percent of patients recover without treatment. ACE inhibitors and ARBs are generally used to reduce proteinuria. Additional medication to control high blood pressure and edema is frequently required. Some patients benefit from steroids, but this treatment does not work for everyone. Additional immunosuppressive medications are helpful for some patients with progressive disease.\n                \nMinimal change disease (MCD) is the diagnosis given when a patient has the nephrotic syndrome and the kidney biopsy reveals little or no change to the structure of glomeruli or surrounding tissues when examined by a light microscope. Tiny drops of a fatty substance called a lipid may be present, but no scarring has taken place within the kidney. MCD may occur at any age, but it is most common in childhood. A small percentage of patients with idiopathic nephrotic syndrome do not respond to steroid therapy. For these patients, the doctor may recommend a low-sodium diet and prescribe a diuretic to control edema. The doctor may recommend the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs to reduce proteinuria. ACE inhibitors and ARBs have also been used to reduce proteinuria in patients with steroid-resistant MCD. These patients may respond to larger doses of steroids, more prolonged use of steroids, or steroids in combination with immunosuppressant drugs, such as chlorambucil, cyclophosphamide, or cyclosporine.",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Glomerular diseases, which affect the kidney's filtration system called the glomeruli, can be caused by various factors. These causes can be broadly categorized into:\n\n1. Genetic factors: Some glomerular diseases, like Alport syndrome and Congenital nephrotic syndrome, are caused by genetic mutations that affect the structure and function of the glomeruli.\n2. Immune-mediated causes: Many glomerular diseases are the result of immune system dysfunction or reaction, such as IgA nephropathy, membranous nephropathy, and lupus nephritis, which are associated with the deposition of immune complexes in the glomeruli.\n3. Infections: Infections, such as HIV, hepatitis, and malaria, can lead to glomerular diseases, often through immune-mediated mechanisms.\n4. Secondary causes: Certain medications, toxins, and systemic diseases, like diabetes and hypertension, can damage the glomeruli and cause glomerular diseases.\n5. Idiopathic causes: In some cases, the exact cause of the glomerular disease remains unknown, and it is classified as idiopathic or of unknown origin.\n\nIt is essential to consult a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment if you suspect glomerular disease.",
        "original_answer": "A number of different diseases can result in glomerular disease. It may be the direct result of an infection or a drug toxic to the kidneys, or it may result from a disease that affects the entire body, like diabetes or lupus. Many different kinds of diseases can cause swelling or scarring of the nephron or glomerulus. Sometimes glomerular disease is idiopathic, meaning that it occurs without an apparent associated disease.\n                \nThe categories presented below can overlap: that is, a disease might belong to two or more of the categories. For example, diabetic nephropathy is a form of glomerular disease that can be placed in two categories: systemic diseases, since diabetes itself is a systemic disease, and sclerotic diseases, because the specific damage done to the kidneys is associated with scarring.\n                \nAutoimmune Diseases\n                \nWhen the body's immune system functions properly, it creates protein-like substances called antibodies and immunoglobulins to protect the body against invading organisms. In an autoimmune disease, the immune system creates autoantibodies, which are antibodies or immunoglobulins that attack the body itself. Autoimmune diseases may be systemic and affect many parts of the body, or they may affect only specific organs or regions.\n                \nSystemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) affects many parts of the body: primarily the skin and joints, but also the kidneys. Because women are more likely to develop SLE than men, some researchers believe that a sex-linked genetic factor may play a part in making a person susceptible, although viral infection has also been implicated as a triggering factor. Lupus nephritis is the name given to the kidney disease caused by SLE, and it occurs when autoantibodies form or are deposited in the glomeruli, causing inflammation. Ultimately, the inflammation may create scars that keep the kidneys from functioning properly. Conventional treatment for lupus nephritis includes a combination of two drugs, cyclophosphamide, a cytotoxic agent that suppresses the immune system, and prednisolone, a corticosteroid used to reduce inflammation. A newer immunosuppressant, mychophenolate mofetil (MMF), has been used instead of cyclophosphamide. Preliminary studies indicate that MMF may be as effective as cyclophosphamide and has milder side effects.\n                \nGoodpasture's Syndrome involves an autoantibody that specifically targets the kidneys and the lungs. Often, the first indication that patients have the autoantibody is when they cough up blood. But lung damage in Goodpasture's Syndrome is usually superficial compared with progressive and permanent damage to the kidneys. Goodpasture's Syndrome is a rare condition that affects mostly young men but also occurs in women, children, and older adults. Treatments include immunosuppressive drugs and a blood-cleaning therapy called plasmapheresis that removes the autoantibodies.\n                \nIgA nephropathy is a form of glomerular disease that results when immunoglobulin A (IgA) forms deposits in the glomeruli, where it creates inflammation. IgA nephropathy was not recognized as a cause of glomerular disease until the late 1960s, when sophisticated biopsy techniques were developed that could identify IgA deposits in kidney tissue.\n                \nThe most common symptom of IgA nephropathy is blood in the urine, but it is often a silent disease that may go undetected for many years. The silent nature of the disease makes it difficult to determine how many people are in the early stages of IgA nephropathy, when specific medical tests are the only way to detect it. This disease is estimated to be the most common cause of primary glomerulonephritisthat is, glomerular disease not caused by a systemic disease like lupus or diabetes mellitus. It appears to affect men more than women. Although IgA nephropathy is found in all age groups, young people rarely display signs of kidney failure because the disease usually takes several years to progress to the stage where it causes detectable complications.\n                \nNo treatment is recommended for early or mild cases of IgA nephropathy when the patient has normal blood pressure and less than 1 gram of protein in a 24-hour urine output. When proteinuria exceeds 1 gram/day, treatment is aimed at protecting kidney function by reducing proteinuria and controlling blood pressure. Blood pressure medicinesangiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)that block a hormone called angiotensin are most effective at achieving those two goals simultaneously.\n                \n\n                \nHereditary NephritisAlport Syndrome\n                \nThe primary indicator of Alport syndrome is a family history of chronic glomerular disease, although it may also involve hearing or vision impairment. This syndrome affects both men and women, but men are more likely to experience chronic kidney disease and sensory loss. Men with Alport syndrome usually first show evidence of renal insufficiency while in their twenties and reach total kidney failure by age 40. Women rarely have significant renal impairment, and hearing loss may be so slight that it can be detected only through testing with special equipment. Usually men can pass the disease only to their daughters. Women can transmit the disease to either their sons or their daughters. Treatment focuses on controlling blood pressure to maintain kidney function.\n                \nInfection-related Glomerular Disease\n                \nGlomerular disease sometimes develops rapidly after an infection in other parts of the body. Acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN) can occur after an episode of strep throat or, in rare cases, impetigo (a skin infection). The Streptococcus bacteria do not attack the kidney directly, but an infection may stimulate the immune system to overproduce antibodies, which are circulated in the blood and finally deposited in the glomeruli, causing damage. PSGN can bring on sudden symptoms of swelling (edema), reduced urine output (oliguria), and blood in the urine (hematuria). Tests will show large amounts of protein in the urine and elevated levels of creatinine and urea nitrogen in the blood, thus indicating reduced kidney function. High blood pressure frequently accompanies reduced kidney function in this disease.\n                \nPSGN is most common in children between the ages of 3 and 7, although it can strike at any age, and it most often affects boys. It lasts only a brief time and usually allows the kidneys to recover. In a few cases, however, kidney damage may be permanent, requiring dialysis or transplantation to replace renal function.\n                \nBacterial endocarditis, infection of the tissues inside the heart, is also associated with subsequent glomerular disease.

These diseases can cause the glomeruli to become inflamed or damaged, leading to problems with kidney function. Symptoms can include protein in the urine, blood in the urine, high blood pressure, and swelling in the legs and ankles. Treatment depends on the specific type and severity of the glomerular disease, but may include medications to control inflammation and immune system activity, as well as lifestyle changes to manage symptoms and slow the progression of the disease.",
        "original_answer": "Renal failure is any acute or chronic loss of kidney function and is the term used when some kidney function remains. Total kidney failure, sometimes called end-stage renal disease (ESRD), indicates permanent loss of kidney function. Depending on the form of glomerular disease, renal function may be lost in a matter of days or weeks or may deteriorate slowly and gradually over the course of decades.\n                \nAcute Renal Failure\n                \nA few forms of glomerular disease cause very rapid deterioration of kidney function. For example, PSGN can cause severe symptoms (hematuria, proteinuria, edema) within 2 to 3 weeks after a sore throat or skin infection develops. The patient may temporarily require dialysis to replace renal function. This rapid loss of kidney function is called acute renal failure (ARF). Although ARF can be life-threatening while it lasts, kidney function usually returns after the cause of the kidney failure has been treated. In many patients, ARF is not associated with any permanent damage. However, some patients may recover from ARF and subsequently develop CKD.\n                \nChronic Kidney Disease\n                \nMost forms of glomerular disease develop gradually, often causing no symptoms for many years. CKD is the slow, gradual loss of kidney function. Some forms of CKD can be controlled or slowed down. For example, diabetic nephropathy can be delayed by tightly controlling blood glucose levels and using ACE inhibitors and ARBs to reduce proteinuria and control blood pressure. But CKD cannot be cured. Partial loss of renal function means that some portion of the patient's nephrons have been scarred, and scarred nephrons cannot be repaired. In many cases, CKD leads to total kidney failure.\n                \nTotal Kidney Failure\n                \nTo stay alive, a patient with total kidney failure must go on dialysishemodialysis or peritoneal dialysisor receive a new kidney through transplantation. Patients with CKD who are approaching total kidney failure should learn as much about their treatment options as possible so they can make an informed decision when the time comes. With the help of dialysis or transplantation, many people continue to lead full, productive lives after reaching total kidney failure.",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "High blood pressure, or hypertension, is a condition where the force of blood against the walls of your arteries is consistently too high. This can damage the arteries and lead to serious health problems, including kidney disease.\n\nKidney disease, or nephropathy, is damage to the kidneys that impairs their function in filtering waste and excess fluids from the blood. High blood pressure is a common cause of kidney disease, as it can damage the blood vessels in the kidneys, reducing their ability to function properly. Both conditions can have serious health consequences if left untreated, so it's important to monitor and manage both conditions carefully.",
        "original_answer": "Blood pressure is the force of blood pushing against blood vessel walls as the heart pumps out blood, and high blood pressure, also called hypertension, is an increase in the amount of force that blood places on blood vessels as it moves through the body. Factors that can increase this force include higher blood volume due to extra fluid in the blood and blood vessels that are narrow, stiff, or clogged.\n                \nBlood pressure test results are written with two numbers separated by a slash. For example, a health care provider will write a blood pressure result as 120/80. A health care provider will say this blood pressure result as 120 over 80. The top number is called the systolic pressure and represents the pressure as the heart beats and pushes blood through the blood vessels. The bottom number is called the diastolic pressure and represents the pressure as blood vessels relax between heartbeats.\n                \nMost people without chronic health conditions have a normal blood pressure if it stays below 120/80. Prehypertension is a systolic pressure of 120 to 139 or a diastolic pressure of 80 to 89. High blood pressure is a systolic pressure of 140 or above or a diastolic pressure of 90 or above.1\n                \nPeople should talk with their health care provider about their individual blood pressure goals and how often they should have their blood pressure checked.",

        "original_answer": "The kidneys are two bean-shaped organs, each about the size of a fist. They are located just below the rib cage, one on each side of the spine. Every day, the two kidneys filter about 120 to 150 quarts of blood to produce about 1 to 2 quarts of urine, composed of wastes and extra fluid. The urine flows from the kidneys to the bladder through tubes called ureters. The bladder stores urine. When the bladder empties, urine flows out of the body through a tube called the urethra, located at the bottom of the bladder. In men the urethra is long, while in women it is short.\n                \nKidneys work at the microscopic level. The kidney is not one large filter. Each kidney is made up of about a million filtering units called nephrons. Each nephron filters a small amount of blood. The nephron includes a filter, called the glomerulus, and a tubule. The nephrons work through a two-step process. The glomerulus lets fluid and waste products pass through it; however, it prevents blood cells and large molecules, mostly proteins, from passing. The filtered fluid then passes through the tubule, which sends needed minerals back to the bloodstream and removes wastes. The final product becomes urine.",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "High blood pressure and kidney disease are commonly related conditions, and diagnosing them involves several steps.\n\nFor high blood pressure, a doctor will typically take multiple blood pressure readings on different occasions. If the readings are consistently high (130/80 mmHg or above), then the patient may be diagnosed with high blood pressure. The doctor may also order additional tests to check for organ damage or other health issues that may be contributing to the high blood pressure.\n\nTo diagnose kidney disease, a doctor will typically start by evaluating the patient's medical history, symptoms, and laboratory test results. They may order urine tests to check for protein and blood in the urine, which can be signs of kidney damage. Blood tests may also be ordered to measure the levels of creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), which are waste products that the kidneys are responsible for removing from the blood. Elevated levels of these substances can indicate reduced kidney function.\n\nIf the initial tests suggest kidney disease, the doctor may order additional tests, such as an ultrasound, CT scan, or MRI, to get a more detailed view of the kidneys and help determine the cause and extent of the damage. Based on the test results, the doctor can determine the stage of kidney disease and develop an appropriate treatment plan.",

Health care providers measure blood pressure with a blood pressure cuff. People can also buy blood pressure cuffs at discount chain stores and drugstores to monitor their blood pressure at home.\n                \nKidney disease is diagnosed with urine and blood tests.\n                \nUrine Tests\n                \nDipstick test for albumin. A dipstick test performed on a urine sample can detect the presence of albumin in the urine. Albumin is a protein in the blood that can pass into the urine when the kidneys are damaged. A patient collects the urine sample in a special container in a health care providers office or a commercial facility. The office or facility tests the sample onsite or sends it to a lab for analysis. For the test, a nurse or technician places a strip of chemically treated paper, called a dipstick, into the urine. Patches on the dipstick change color when blood or protein is present in urine.\n                \nUrine albumin-to-creatinine ratio. A health care provider uses the albumin and creatinine measurement to determine the ratio between the albumin and creatinine in the urine. Creatinine is a waste product in the blood that is filtered in the kidneys and excreted in the urine. A urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio above 30 mg/g may be a sign of kidney disease.\n                \nBlood Test\n                \nA blood test involves having blood drawn at a health care providers office or a commercial facility and sending the sample to a lab for analysis. A health care provider may order a blood test to estimate how much blood the kidneys filter each minute, called the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). The results of the test indicate the following:\n                \n- eGFR of 60 or above is in the normal range  - eGFR below 60 may indicate kidney damage  - eGFR of 15 or below may indicate kidney failure\n                \n\n                \nGet Screened for Kidney Disease   Kidney disease, when found early, can be treated to prevent more serious disease and other complications. The National Kidney Foundation recommends people with high blood pressure receive the following regular screenings:   - blood pressure tests   - urine albumin   - eGFR    Health care providers will help determine how often people with high blood pressure should be screened.",

Two types of blood pressure-lowering medications, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), have been shown effective in slowing the progression of kidney disease. Many people require two or more medications to control their blood pressure. In addition to an ACE inhibitor or an ARB, a health care provider may prescribe a diuretica medication that helps the kidneys remove fluid from the blood. A person may also need beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, and other blood pressure medications.",

A target of less than 130/80 mmHg is often recommended, but your doctor may suggest a different goal for you.\n\nLifestyle changes can help lower your blood pressure and protect your kidneys:\n\n1. Healthy diet: Follow a diet that is low in sodium (less than 2,000 mg per day), saturated fats, and cholesterol. Aim for plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat dairy products.\n2. Weight loss: If you're overweight, losing as little as 5-10% of your body weight can make a big difference in managing your blood pressure.\n3. Exercise: Regular physical activity, such as brisk walking, for at least 30 minutes a day on most days of the week can help lower your blood pressure.\n4. Limit alcohol: Drinking alcohol in moderation, if at all, is important. For most adults, that means up to one drink a day for women and up to two drinks a day for men.\n5. Quit smoking: Smoking can increase your risk of kidney disease and heart disease. Quitting smoking can help protect your kidneys and lower your risk of complications.\n\nIn addition to lifestyle changes, your doctor may prescribe medications to help lower your blood pressure and protect your kidneys. Common classes of medications used to treat high blood pressure in people with kidney disease include ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and diuretics.\n\nIt's essential to work closely with your healthcare provider to develop a personalized treatment plan that addresses both your high blood pressure and kidney disease.",
        "original_answer": "Following a healthy eating plan can help lower blood pressure. A health care provider may recommend the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating plan. DASH focuses on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and other foods that are heart healthy and lower in sodium, which often comes from salt. The DASH eating plan\n                \n- is low in fat and cholesterol  - features fat-free or low-fat milk and dairy products, fish, poultry, and nuts  - suggests less red meat, sweets, added sugars, and sugar-containing beverages  - is rich in nutrients, protein, and fiber\n                \nRead more about DASH at www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/resources/heart/hbp-dash-index.htm.\n                \nA dietitian may also recommend this type of diet for people who have already developed kidney disease. A diet low in sodium and liquid intake can help reduce edema and lower blood pressure. Reducing saturated fat and cholesterol can help control high levels of lipids, or fats, in the blood.\n                \nHealth care providers may recommend that people with kidney disease eat moderate or reduced amounts of protein, though the benefits of reducing protein in a persons diet is still being researched. Proteins break down into waste products that the kidneys filter from the blood. Eating more protein than the body needs may burden the kidneys and cause kidney function to decline faster. However, protein intake that is too low may lead to malnutrition, a condition that occurs when the body does not get enough nutrients. People with kidney disease who are on a restricted protein diet should be monitored with blood tests that can show low nutrient levels.\n                \nIn addition, consuming too much alcohol raises blood pressure, so people should limit alcoholic drinkstwo per day for men and one per day for women.\n                \nA health care provider can help people change their diet to meet their individual needs.\n                \nPhysical Activity\n                \nRegular physical activity can lower blood pressure and reduce the chances of other health problems. A health care provider can provide information about how much and what kinds of activity are safe. Most people should try to get at least 30 to 60 minutes of activity most or all days of the week. A person can do all physical activity at once or break up activities into shorter periods of at least 10 minutes each. Moderate activities include brisk walking, dancing, bowling, riding a bike, working in a garden, and cleaning the house.\n                \nBody Weight\n                \nPeople who are overweight or obese should aim to reduce their weight by 7 to 10 percent during the first year of treatment for high blood pressure. This amount of weight loss can lower the chance of health problems related to high blood pressure. Overweight is defined as a body mass index (BMI)a measurement of weight in relation to heightof 25 to 29. A BMI of 30 or higher is considered obese. A BMI lower than 25 is the goal for keeping blood pressure under control.5\n                \nSmoking\n                \nPeople who smoke should quit. Smoking can damage blood vessels, raise the chance of high blood pressure, and worsen health problems related to high blood pressure. People with high blood pressure should talk with their health care provider about programs and products they can use to quit smoking.\n                \nStress\n                \nLearning how to manage stress, relax, and cope with problems can improve emotional and physical health.

As cirrhosis gets worse you may\n                \n- feel tired or weak  - lose your appetite  - feel sick to your stomach  - lose weight  - notice red, spider-shaped blood vessels under your skin\n                \nCirrhosis can lead to other serious problems:\n                \n- You may bruise or bleed easily, or have nosebleeds.  - Bloating or swelling may occur as fluid builds up in your legs or abdomenthe area between your chest and hips. Fluid buildup in your legs is called edema; buildup in your abdomen is called ascites.  - Medicines, including those you can buy over the counter such as vitamins and herbal supplements, may have a stronger effect on you. Your liver does not break medicines down as quickly as a healthy liver would.   - Waste materials from food may build up in your blood or brain and cause confusion or difficulty thinking.   - Blood pressure may increase in the vein entering your liver, a condition called portal hypertension.   - Enlarged veins, called varices, may develop in your esophagus and stomach. Varices can bleed suddenly, causing you to throw up blood or pass blood in a bowel movement.   - Your kidneys may not work properly or may fail.   - Your skin and the whites of your eyes may turn yellow, a condition called jaundice.   - You may develop severe itching.   - You may develop gallstones.\n                \nIn the early stages, cirrhosis causes your liver to swell. Then, as more scar tissue replaces healthy tissue, your liver shrinks.\n                \nA small number of people with cirrhosis also get liver cancer.",

        "llm_vanilla_answer": "Cirrhosis is a condition characterized by irreversible scarring of the liver. To diagnose cirrhosis, a doctor will typically:\n\n1. Take a medical history: This includes asking questions about your alcohol consumption, medication use, and symptoms.\n2. Perform a physical exam: The doctor may check for signs of liver disease, such as a swollen abdomen, yellowing of the skin and eyes (jaundice), and spider-like blood vessels on the skin.\n3. Order diagnostic tests: These may include blood tests, imaging tests (such as ultrasound, CT scan, or MRI), and sometimes a liver biopsy to confirm the diagnosis and assess the severity of the cirrhosis.\n\nIf you suspect you have cirrhosis, it is important to see a doctor as soon as possible for a proper diagnosis and treatment. Early detection and management can help slow the progression of the disease and prevent complications.",

Here are some common treatments:\n\n1. **Lifestyle changes**: Alcohol abstinence, a healthy diet, and regular exercise can help manage symptoms and prevent further liver damage.\n2. **Medications**: Doctors may prescribe medications to manage symptoms and complications, such as diuretics for fluid retention, antibiotics for infections, or medications to reduce itching.\n3. **Surgery or medical procedures**: In severe cases, surgery or medical procedures may be necessary. For example, a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) can be used to reduce portal hypertension, or a liver transplant may be necessary in end-stage cirrhosis.\n4. **Regular monitoring**: Regular check-ups with a healthcare provider are essential to monitor the progression of the disease and manage any complications.\n\nRemember, it's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment.",
        "original_answer": "Once you have cirrhosis, nothing can make all the scar tissue go away. But treating the cause will keep cirrhosis from getting worse.
