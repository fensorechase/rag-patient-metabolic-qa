Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: What are the treatments for Kidney Stones in Adults?\n\n    Reference Answer: Treatment for kidney stones usually depends on their size and what they are made of, as well as whether they are causing pain or obstructing the urinary tract. Kidney stones may be treated by a general practitioner or by a urologista doctor who specializes in the urinary tract. Small stones usually pass through the urinary tract without treatment. Still, the person may need pain medication and should drink lots of fluids to help move the stone along. Pain control may consist of oral or intravenous (IV) medication, depending on the duration and severity of the pain. IV fluids may be needed if the person becomes dehydrated from vomiting or an inability to drink. A person with a larger stone, or one that blocks urine flow and causes great pain, may need more urgent treatment, such as\n                \n- Shock wave lithotripsy. A machine called a lithotripter is used to crush the kidney stone. The procedure is performed by a urologist on an outpatient basis and anesthesia is used. In shock wave lithotripsy, the person lies on a table or, less commonly, in a tub of water above the lithotripter. The lithotripter generates shock waves that pass through the persons body to break the kidney stone into smaller pieces to pass more readily through the urinary tract.  - Ureteroscopy. A ureteroscopea long, tubelike instrument with an eyepieceis used to find and retrieve the stone with a small basket or to break the stone up with laser energy. The procedure is performed by a urologist in a hospital with anesthesia. The urologist inserts the ureteroscope into the persons urethra and slides the scope through the bladder and into the ureter. The urologist removes the stone or, if the stone is large, uses a flexible fiber attached to a laser generator to break the stone into smaller pieces that can pass out of the body in the urine. The person usually goes home the same day.\n                \n- Percutaneous nephrolithotomy. In this procedure, a wire-thin viewing instrument called a nephroscope is used to locate and remove the stone. The procedure is performed by a urologist in a hospital with anesthesia. During the procedure, a tube is inserted directly into the kidney through a small incision in the persons back. For large stones, an ultrasonic probe that acts as a lithotripter...\n\n    Generated Answer: Treatment for kidney stones in adults depends on the size and location of the stone, as well as the symptoms it is causing. Here are some common treatment options:\n\n1. Pain relief: Over-the-counter pain medications like ibuprofen or naproxen can help manage the pain associated with kidney stones. In some cases, prescription pain medications may be necessary.\n2. Hydration: Drinking plenty of water can help flush small stones out of the urinary system.\n3. Medical expulsive therapy (MET): If the stone is small enough, your doctor may prescribe medication to help the stone pass more quickly and painlessly.\n4. Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL): This non-invasive procedure uses shock waves to break up the stone into smaller pieces that can be passed more...\n\n    Scoring guide:\n    1.

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: How to prevent Kidney Stones in Adults?\n\n    Reference Answer: The first step in preventing kidney stones is to understand what is causing the stones to form. The health care provider may ask the person to try to catch the kidney stone as it passes, so it can be sent to a lab for analysis. Stones that are retrieved surgically can also be sent to a lab for analysis.\n                \nThe health care provider may ask the person to collect urine for 24 hours after a stone has passed or been removed to measure daily urine volume and mineral levels. Producing too little urine or having a mineral abnormality can make a person more likely to form stones. Kidney stones may be prevented through changes in eating, diet, and nutrition and medications.\n                \nEating, Diet, and Nutrition\n                \nPeople can help prevent kidney stones by making changes in their fluid intake. Depending on the type of kidney stone a person has, changes in the amounts of sodium, animal protein, calcium, and oxalate consumed can also help.\n                \nDrinking enough fluids each day is the best way to help prevent most types of kidney stones. Health care providers recommend that a person drink 2 to 3 liters of fluid a day. People with cystine stones may need to drink even more. Though water is best, other fluids may also help prevent kidney stones, such as orange juice or lemonade. Talk with your health care provider if you cant drink the recommended amount due to other health problems, such as urinary incontinence, urinary frequency, or kidney failure.\n                \nRecommendations based on the specific type of kidney stone include the following:\n                \nCalcium Oxalate Stones\n                \n- reducing sodium  - reducing animal protein, such as meat, eggs, and fish  - getting enough calcium from food or taking calcium supplements with food  - avoiding foods high in oxalate, such as spinach, rhubarb, nuts, and wheat bran\n                \nCalcium Phosphate Stones\n                \n- reducing sodium  - reducing animal protein  - getting enough calcium from food or taking calcium supplements with food\n                \nUric Acid Stones\n                \n- limiting animal protein\n                \nMore information about how changes in diet affect kidney stone formation is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Diet for Kidney Stone Prevention.\n                \nMedications\n                \nThe health care provider may prescribe certain medications to help prevent kidney stones based on the type of stone formed or conditions that make a person more prone to form stones:\n                \n- hyperuricosuriaallopurinol (Zyloprim), which decreases uric acid in the blood and urine  - hypercalciuriadiuretics, such as hydrochlorothiazide  - hyperoxaluriapotassium citrate to raise the citrate and pH of urine  - uric acid stonesallopurinol and potassium citrate  - cystine stonesmercaptopropionyl glycine, which decreases cystine in the urine, and...\n\n    Generated Answer: Here are some ways to help prevent kidney stones in adults:\n\n1. Drink plenty of water: Aim for at least 8 to 10 cups of water a day to help flush out your urinary system.\n2. Limit salt and animal protein: A diet high in salt and animal protein can increase your risk of kidney stones.\n3. Eat more fruits and vegetables: A diet rich in fruits and vegetables can help prevent kidney stones.\n4.

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: How to diagnose Vesicoureteral Reflux?\n\n    Reference Answer: The most common tests used to diagnose VUR include\n                \n- Voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG). VCUG is an x-ray image of the bladder and urethra taken during urination, also called voiding. The bladder and urethra are filled with a special dye, called contrast medium, to make the urethra clearly visible. The x-ray machine captures a video of the contrast medium when the child urinates. The procedure is performed in a health care providers office, outpatient center, or hospital by an x-ray technician supervised by a radiologista doctor who specializes in medical imagingwho then interprets the images. Anesthesia is not needed, but sedation may be used for some children. This test can show abnormalities of the inside of the urethra and bladder.  - Radionuclide cystogram (RNC). RNC is a type of nuclear scan that involves placing radioactive material into the bladder. A scanner then detects the radioactive material as the child urinates or after the bladder is empty. The procedure is performed in a health care providers office, outpatient center, or hospital by a specially trained technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologist. Anesthesia is not needed, but sedation may be used for some children. RNC is more sensitive than VCUG but does not provide as much detail of the bladder anatomy.  - Abdominal ultrasound. Ultrasound uses a device, called a transducer, that bounces safe, painless sound waves off organs to create an image of their structure. An abdominal ultrasound can create images of the entire urinary tract, including the kidneys and bladder. The procedure is performed in a health care providers office, outpatient center, or hospital by a specially trained technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologist; anesthesia is not needed. Ultrasound may be used before VCUG or RNC if the childs family or health care provider wants to avoid exposure to x-ray radiation or radioactive material.\n                \nTesting is usually done on\n                \n- infants diagnosed during pregnancy with urine blockage affecting the kidneys  - children younger than 5 years of age with a UTI  - children with a UTI and fever, called febrile UTI, regardless of age  - males with a UTI who are not sexually active, regardless of age or...\n\n    Generated Answer: Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) is typically diagnosed through a combination of methods:\n\n1. Medical history: The doctor will ask about symptoms, urinary tract infections (UTIs), and family history of VUR or kidney disease.\n2. Physical examination: A general exam of the abdomen, back, and genitals may reveal any abnormalities.\n3. Imaging tests:\na. Voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG): This is the most common test used to diagnose VUR. A catheter is inserted into the bladder through the urethra, and a special dye is introduced. X-rays are taken while the bladder fills and empties to assess if there is any reflux of the dye into the ureters and kidneys.\nb. Renal ultrasound: This test uses sound waves to create images of...\n\n    Scoring guide:\n    1. Scientific Consensus: 1=Aligned, 0=No consensus, -1=Opposed\n    2.

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: What causes Acromegaly?\n\n    Reference Answer: Acromegaly is caused by prolonged overproduction of GH by the pituitary gland. The pituitary produces several important hormones that control body functions such as growth and development, reproduction, and metabolism. But hormones never seem to act simply and directly. They usually \"cascade\" or flow in a series, affecting each other's production or release into the bloodstream.\n                \nGH is part of a cascade of hormones that, as the name implies, regulates the physical growth of the body. This cascade begins in a part of the brain called the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus makes hormones that regulate the pituitary. One of the hormones in the GH series, or \"axis,\" is growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH), which stimulates the pituitary gland to produce GH.\n                \nSecretion of GH by the pituitary into the bloodstream stimulates the liver to produce another hormone called insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I). IGF-I is what actually causes tissue growth in the body. High levels of IGF-I, in turn, signal the pituitary to reduce GH production.\n                \nThe hypothalamus makes another hormone called somatostatin, which inhibits GH production and release. Normally, GHRH, somatostatin, GH, and IGF-I levels in the body are tightly regulated by each other and by sleep, exercise, stress, food intake, and blood sugar levels. If the pituitary continues to make GH independent of the normal regulatory mechanisms, the level of IGF-I continues to rise, leading to bone overgrowth and organ enlargement. High levels of IGF-I also cause changes in glucose (sugar) and lipid (fat) metabolism and can lead to diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart disease.\n                \nPituitary Tumors\n                \nIn more than 95 percent of people with acromegaly, a benign tumor of the pituitary gland, called an adenoma, produces excess GH. Pituitary tumors are labeled either micro- or macro-adenomas, depending on their size. Most GH-secreting tumors are macro-adenomas, meaning they are larger than 1 centimeter. Depending on their location, these larger tumors may compress surrounding brain structures. For example, a tumor growing upward may affect the optic chiasm-where the optic nerves crossleading to visual problems and vision loss. If the tumor grows to the side, it may enter an area of the brain called the cavernous sinus where there are many nerves, potentially damaging them.\n                \nCompression of the surrounding normal pituitary tissue can alter production of other hormones. These hormonal shifts can lead to changes in menstruation and breast discharge in women and erectile dysfunction in men. If the tumor affects the part of the pituitary that controls the thyroidanother hormone-producing glandthen thyroid hormones may decrease. Too little thyroid hormone can cause weight gain, fatigue, and hair and skin changes. If the tumor affects the part of the pituitary that controls the adrenal gland, the hormone cortisol may decrease. Too little cortisol can cause weight loss, dizziness, fatigue, low blood pressure, and nausea.\n                \nSome GH-secreting tumors may also secrete too much of other pituitary hormones. For example, they may produce prolactin, the hormone that stimulates the mammary glands to produce milk. Rarely, adenomas may produce thyroid-stimulating hormone. Doctors should assess all pituitary hormones in people with acromegaly.\n                \nRates of GH production and the aggressiveness of the tumor vary greatly among people with adenomas. Some adenomas grow slowly and symptoms of GH excess are often not noticed for many years. Other adenomas grow more rapidly and invade surrounding brain areas or the venous sinuses, which are located near the pituitary gland. Younger patients tend to have more aggressive tumors. Regardless of size, these tumors are always benign.\n                \nMost pituitary tumors develop spontaneously and are not genetically inherited. They are the result of a genetic alteration in a single pituitary cell, which leads to increased cell division and tumor formation. This genetic change, or mutation, is not present at birth, but happens later in life. The mutation occurs in a gene that regulates the transmission of chemical signals within pituitary cells. It permanently switches on the signal that tells the cell to divide and secrete GH. The events within the cell that cause disordered pituitary cell growth and GH oversecretion currently are the subject of intensive research.\n                \nNonpituitary Tumors\n                \nRarely, acromegaly is caused not by pituitary tumors but by tumors of the pancreas, lungs, and other parts of the brain. These tumors also lead to excess GH, either because they produce GH themselves or, more frequently, because they produce GHRH, the hormone that stimulates...\n\n    Generated Answer: Acromegaly is caused by prolonged overproduction of Growth Hormone (GH) by the pituitary gland, often due to a benign tumor called an adenoma. The tumor can compress surrounding brain structures, leading to various symptoms and hormonal imbalances. In rare cases, non-pituitary tumors can also cause acromegaly by producing GH or GHRH.",

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: How to diagnose Acromegaly?\n\n    Reference Answer: Blood tests\n                \nIf acromegaly is suspected, a doctor must measure the GH level in a persons blood to determine if it is elevated. However, a single measurement of an elevated blood GH level is not enough to diagnose acromegaly: Because GH is secreted by the pituitary in impulses, or spurts, its concentration in the blood can vary widely from minute to minute. At a given moment, a person with acromegaly may have a normal GH level, whereas a GH level in a healthy person may even be five times higher.\n                \nMore accurate information is obtained when GH is measured under conditions that normally suppress GH secretion. Health care professionals often use the oral glucose tolerance test to diagnose acromegaly because drinking 75 to 100 grams of glucose solution lowers blood GH levels to less than 1 nanogram per milliliter (ng/ml) in healthy people. In people with GH overproduction, this suppression does not occur. The oral glucose tolerance test is a highly reliable method for confirming a diagnosis of acromegaly.\n                \nPhysicians also can measure IGF-I levels, which increase as GH levels go up, in people with suspected acromegaly. Because IGF-I levels are much more stable than GH levels over the course of the day, they are often a more practical and reliable screening measure. Elevated IGF-I levels almost always indicate acromegaly. However, a pregnant womans IGF-I levels are two to three times higher than normal. In addition, physicians must be aware that IGF-I levels decline with age and may also be abnormally low in people with poorly controlled diabetes or liver or kidney disease.\n                \nImaging\n                \nAfter acromegaly has been diagnosed by measuring GH or IGF-I levels, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the pituitary is used to locate and detect the size of the tumor causing GH overproduction. MRI is the most sensitive imaging technique, but computerized tomography (CT) scans can be used if the patient should not have MRI. For example, people who have pacemakers or other types of implants containing metal should not have an MRI...\n\n    Generated Answer: Acromegaly is a rare condition characterized by the overproduction of growth hormone. Here's a simplified process for diagnosing Acromegaly:\n\n1. **Medical History and Physical Examination**: The doctor will first take a detailed medical history and perform a physical examination. They may notice signs such as enlarged hands, feet, or facial features.\n\n2. **Growth Hormone (GH) Levels**: If Acromegaly is suspected, the doctor will typically measure GH levels in the blood. However, GH levels vary throughout the day, making diagnosis difficult.\n\n3. **Insulin-like Growth Factor-1 (IGF-1) Test**: IGF-1 is a hormone produced in response to GH. Its levels remain fairly constant throughout the day, making it a better indicator of excessive GH. High IGF-1 levels suggest Acromegaly.\n\n4. **Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT)**: This test involves drinking a sugary drink and then having your blood sugar and GH levels checked at various intervals. In normal people, GH levels should drop to very low levels. In Acromegaly, the GH levels remain high.\n\n5. **Imaging...\n\n    Scoring guide:\n    1.

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: What are the treatments for Acromegaly?\n\n    Reference Answer: Currently, treatment options include surgical removal of the tumor, medical therapy, and radiation therapy of the pituitary.\n                \nGoals of treatment are to\n                \n- reduce excess hormone production to normal levels  - relieve the pressure that the growing pituitary tumor may be exerting on the surrounding brain areas  - preserve normal pituitary function or treat hormone deficiencies  - improve the symptoms of acromegaly\n                \nSurgery\n                \nSurgery is the first option recommended for most people with acromegaly, as it is often a rapid and effective treatment. The surgeon reaches the pituitary via an incision through the nose or inside the upper lip and, with special tools, removes the tumor tissue in a procedure called transsphenoidal surgery. This procedure promptly relieves the pressure on the surrounding brain regions and leads to a rapid lowering of GH levels. If the surgery is successful, facial appearance and soft tissue swelling improve within a few days.\n                \nSurgery is most successful in patients with blood GH levels below 45 ng/ml before the operation and with pituitary tumors no larger than 10 millimeters (mm) in diameter. Success depends in large part on the skill and experience of the surgeon, as well as the location of the tumor. Even with the most experienced neurosurgeon, the chance of a cure is small if the tumor has extended into critical brain structures or into the cavernous sinus where surgery could be risky.\n                \nThe success rate also depends on what level of GH is defined as a cure. The best measure of surgical success is normalization of GH and IGF-I levels. The overall rate of remission-control of the disease-after surgery ranges from 55 to 80 percent. (See For More Information to locate a board-certified neurosurgeon.)\n                \nA possible complication of surgery is damage to the surrounding normal pituitary tissue, which requires lifelong use of pituitary hormone replacement. The part of the pituitary that stores antidiuretic hormonea hormone important in water balancemay be temporarily or, rarely, permanently damaged and the patient may require medical therapy. Other potential problems include cerebrospinal fluid leaks and, rarely, meningitis. Cerebrospinal fluid bathes the brain and can leak from the nose if the incision area doesnt heal well. Meningitis is a bacterial or viral infection of the meninges, the outer covering of the brain.\n                \nEven when surgery is successful and hormone levels return to normal, people with acromegaly must be carefully monitored for years for possible recurrence of the disease. More commonly, hormone levels improve, but do not return to normal. Additional treatment, usually medications, may be required.\n                \nMedical Therapy\n                \nMedical therapy is most often used if surgery does not result in a cure and sometimes to shrink large tumors before surgery. Three medication groups are used to treat acromegaly.\n                \nSomatostatin analogs (SSAs) are the first medication group used to treat acromegaly. They shut off GH production and are effective in lowering GH and IGF-I levels in 50 to 70 percent of patients. SSAs also reduce tumor size in around 0 to 50 percent of patients but only to a modest degree. Several studies have shown that SSAs are safe and effective for long-term treatment and in treating patients with acromegaly caused by nonpituitary tumors. Long-acting SSAs are given by intramuscular injection once a month.\n                \nDigestive problems-such as loose stools, nausea, and gas-are a side effect in about half of people taking SSAs. However, the effects are usually temporary and rarely severe. About 10 to 20 percent of patients develop gallstones, but the gallstones do not usually cause symptoms. In rare cases, treatment can result in elevated blood glucose levels. More commonly, SSAs reduce the need for insulin and improve blood glucose control in some people with acromegaly who already have diabetes.\n                \nThe second medication group is the GH receptor antagonists (GHRAs), which interfere with the action of GH. They normalize IGF-I levels in more than 90 percent of patients. They do not, however, lower GH levels. Given once a day through injection, GHRAs are usually well-tolerated by patients. The long-term effects of these drugs on tumor growth are still under study. Side effects can include headaches, fatigue, and abnormal liver function.\n                \nDopamine agonists make up the third medication group. These drugs are not as effective as the other medications at lowering GH or IGF-I levels, and they normalize IGF-I levels in only a minority of patients. Dopamine agonists are sometimes effective in patients who have mild degrees of excess GH and have both acromegaly and hyperprolactinemiatoo much of the hormone prolactin. Cabergoline is the preferred dopamine agonist because it is better tolerated than bromocriptine. Side effects can include nausea, headache, and dizziness.\n                \nRadiation Therapy\n                \nRadiation therapy is used for people who cannot undergo surgery or who do not respond to surgery or medical therapy. It is often used in combination with medication. Radiation therapy works slowly over months to years to decrease GH levels. Because its effects are slow, this type of therapy is not the first choice for people with very high GH levels or those with serious signs and symptoms such as visual field loss or unrelenting headache. Radiation therapy can lead to hypopituitarism-a condition in which the pituitary gland does not produce one or more of its hormones-and so requires careful monitoring.\n                \nIn summary, treatment of acromegaly involves a multidisciplinary approach combining the skills of endocrinologists, neurosurgeons, radiologists, and ophthalmologists. A team approach ensures comprehensive care and followup of patients with acromegaly.\n                \nFor More Information\n                \nNational Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases\n                \nNational Endocrine and Metabolic Diseases Information Service\n                \n1 Information Way\n                \nBethesda, MD 20892-3560\n                \nPhone: 1800-860-8747\n                \nEmail: [endodmail@info.niddk.nih.gov](mailto:endodmail@info.niddk.nih.gov)\n                \nThis e-text is not copyrighted.

            "raw_response": "Evaluate this medical answer based on the criteria below. Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: What are the treatments for Prolactinoma?\n\n    Reference Answer: The goals of treatment are to return prolactin secretion to normal, reduce tumor size, correct any visual abnormalities, and restore normal pituitary function. In the case of large tumors, only partial achievement of these goals may be possible.\n                \nMedical Treatment\n                \nBecause dopamine is the chemical that normally inhibits prolactin secretion, doctors may treat prolactinoma with the dopamine agonists bromocriptine (Parlodel) or cabergoline (Dostinex). Agonists are drugs that act like a naturally occurring substance. These drugs shrink the tumor and return prolactin levels to normal in approximately 80 percent of patients. Both drugs have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of hyperprolactinemia. Bromocriptine is the only dopamine agonist approved for the treatment of infertility. This drug has been in use longer than cabergoline and has a well-established safety record.\n                \nNausea and dizziness are possible side effects of bromocriptine. To avoid these side effects, bromocriptine treatment must be started slowly. A typical starting dose is one-quarter to one-half of a 2.5 milligram (mg) tablet taken at bedtime with a snack. The dose is gradually increased every 3 to 7 days as needed and taken in divided doses with meals or at bedtime with a snack. Most people are successfully treated with 7.5 mg a day or less, although some people need 15 mg or more each day. Because bromocriptine is short acting, it should be taken either twice or three times daily.\n                \nBromocriptine treatment should not be stopped without consulting a qualified endocrinologist-a doctor specializing in disorders of the hormone-producing glands. Prolactin levels rise again in most people when the drug is discontinued. In some, however, prolactin levels remain normal, so the doctor may suggest reducing or discontinuing treatment every 2 years on a trial basis.\n                \nCabergoline is a newer drug that may be more effective than bromocriptine in normalizing prolactin levels and shrinking tumor size. Cabergoline also has less frequent and less severe side effects. Cabergoline is more expensive than bromocriptine and, being newer on the market, its long-term safety record is less well defined. As with bromocriptine therapy, nausea and dizziness are possible side effects but may be avoided if treatment is started slowly. The usual starting dose is.25 mg twice a week. The dose may be increased every 4 weeks as needed, up to 1 mg two times a week. Cabergoline should not be stopped without consulting a qualified endocrinologist.\n                \nRecent studies suggest prolactin levels are more likely to remain normal after discontinuing long-term cabergoline therapy than after discontinuing bromocriptine. More research is needed to confirm these findings.\n                \nIn people taking cabergoline or bromocriptine to treat Parkinson's disease at doses more than 10 times higher than those used for prolactinomas, heart valve damage has been reported. Rare cases of valve damage have been reported in people taking low doses of cabergoline to treat hyperprolactinemia. Before starting these medications, the doctor will order an echocardiogram. An echocardiogram is a sonogram of the heart that checks the heart valves and heart function.\n                \nBecause limited information exists about the risks of long-term, low-dose cabergoline use, doctors generally prescribe the lowest effective dose and periodically reassess the need for continuing therapy. People taking cabergoline who develop symptoms of shortness of breath or swelling of the feet should promptly notify their physician because these may be signs of heart valve damage.\n                \nSurgery\n                \nSurgery to remove all or part of the tumor should only be considered if medical therapy cannot be tolerated or if it fails to reduce prolactin levels, restore normal reproduction and pituitary function, and reduce tumor size. If medical therapy is only partially successful, it should be continued, possibly combined with surgery or radiation.\n                \nMost often, the tumor is removed through the nasal cavity. Rarely, if the tumor is large or has spread to nearby brain tissue, the surgeon will access the tumor through an opening in the skull.\n                \nThe results of surgery depend a great deal on tumor size and prolactin levels as well as the skill and experience of the neurosurgeon. The higher the prolactin level before surgery, the lower the chance of normalizing serum prolactin. Serum is the portion of the blood used in measuring prolactin levels. In the best medical centers, surgery corrects prolactin levels in about 80 percent of patients with small tumors and a serum prolactin less than 250 ng/mL. However, even a successful surgical outcome does not guarantee a permanent cure. Tumor regrowth has occurred even in patients who had received successful treatment and achieved normal prolactin levels. Long-term follow-up is necessary.\n                \nRadiation Therapy\n                \nConventional radiation therapy-also called external beam radiation therapy-is another form of treatment for people who cannot take medication or when the tumor continues to grow despite aggressive medical and surgical therapy. Radiation can decrease tumor size and lower prolactin levels. However, its success depends upon the size of the tumor and how much it has invaded surrounding tissues. It works best for smaller tumors.\n                \nRadiosurgery is a more precise form of radiation therapy that focuses high-powered x-rays on a very specific area of the body. Although radiosurgery has been used to treat prolactinomas, its effectiveness and long-term benefits and risks have yet to be determined.\n                \nPregnancy\n                \nWomen with prolactinomas who wish to become pregnant should discuss the timing of pregnancy with their endocrinologist. Women with microadenomas have a very low risk of complications during pregnancy and do not require special monitoring. Women with macroadenomas may resume normal reproductive functions with appropriate treatment; however, they should be monitored carefully throughout pregnancy because a growing pituitary gland can compress nerves, causing headaches, blurred vision, or other neurological symptoms. In general, women with macroadenomas who become pregnant while taking bromocriptine or cabergoline should stop taking the medication after confirming their pregnancies and undergo regular visual field testing to detect any changes that might indicate compression of nerves by the growing pituitary gland. Some women with macroadenomas may safely continue bromocriptine throughout pregnancy. In rare instances, the pituitary gland can become overactive and secrete excessive amounts of prolactin, leading to symptoms such as headache and visual disturbances. In these cases, the woman's doctor may reinstitute bromocriptine treatment.\n                \nIf a woman has a history of problems with her pituitary gland prior to pregnancy, she should be seen regularly by an endocrinologist throughout her pregnancy and after childbirth to ensure that she remains free of symptoms.\n\n    Model Answer: Medical treatment with dopamine agonists such as bromocriptine or cabergoline, surgery to remove the tumor, and radiation therapy are the main treatments for prolactinoma. The goal of treatment is to normalize prolactin levels, reduce tumor size, and restore normal pituitary function.",

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: How to diagnose Nephrotic Syndrome in Adults?\n\n    Reference Answer: Urine samples are taken to diagnose people suspected of having nephrotic syndrome.\n                \nNephrotic syndrome is diagnosed when large amounts of protein are found in the urine. The blood protein albumin makes up much of the protein that is lost, though many other important proteins are also lost in nephrotic syndrome.\n                \nThe presence of albumin in the urine can be detected with a dipstick test performed on a urine sample. The urine sample is collected in a special container in a health care providers office or commercial facility and can be tested in the same location or sent to a lab for analysis. For the test, a nurse or technician places a strip of chemically treated paper, called a dipstick, into the urine. Patches on the dipstick change color when protein is present in urine.\n                \nA more precise measurement is usually needed to confirm the diagnosis. Either a single urine sample or a 24-hour collection of urine can be sent to a lab for analysis. With the single urine sample, the lab measures both albumin and creatinine, a waste product of normal muscle breakdown. The comparison of the measurements is called a urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio. A urine sample containing more than 30 milligrams of albumin for each gram of creatinine may signal a problem. With a 24-hour collection of urine, the lab measures only the amount of albumin present. The single urine sample is easier to collect than the 24-hour sample and is usually sufficient to confirm diagnosis, though the 24-hour collection may be used in some cases.\n                \nOnce nephrotic syndrome is diagnosed, blood tests are usually needed to check for systemic diseases that may be causing the nephrotic syndrome and to find out how well the kidneys are working overall. A blood test involves drawing blood at a health care providers office or commercial facility and sending the sample to a lab for analysis.\n                \nThough blood tests can point toward systemic diseases, a kidney biopsy is usually needed to diagnose the...\n\n    Generated Answer: To diagnose Nephrotic Syndrome in adults, a doctor would typically follow these steps:\n\n1. Medical History: The doctor will ask about symptoms, medical history, and family history of kidney disease.\n2. Physical Examination: A physical exam may reveal signs of Nephrotic Syndrome, such as swelling in the legs, ankles, or feet.\n3. Urine Tests: A urinalysis can detect protein in the urine, which is a key indicator of Nephrotic Syndrome.\n4. Blood Tests: Blood tests can measure the levels of protein and cholesterol in the blood.

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: What are the treatments for Treatment Methods for Kidney Failure: Peritoneal Dialysis?\n\n    Reference Answer: Your health care team will perform several tests to tell if your dialysis exchanges are removing enough wastes. These tests are especially important during the first weeks of treatment to determine whether your schedule is adequate.\n                \nPeritoneal Equilibration Test\n                \nFor a peritoneal equilibration test, a dialysis nurse takes samples of your blood and dialysis solution during a 4-hour exchange. The peritoneal equilibration test measures how much dextrose your body absorbs from a bag of dialysis solution. The peritoneal equilibration test also measures how much urea and creatininewaste products of normal muscle and protein breakdownmove from your blood into the dialysis solution.\n                \nClearance Test\n                \nFor a clearance test, you will collect the used dialysis solution from a 24-hour period. A dialysis nurse takes a blood sample during the same 24-hour period. Your doctor or nurse compares the amount of urea in the used solution with the amount in your blood to see how much urea was removed. For the first months or even years of peritoneal dialysis treatment, you may still produce small amounts of urine. If you produce more than 100 milliliters (3 ounces) of urine per day, you will also collect your urine to measure its urea...\n\n    Generated Answer: Peritoneal dialysis is a type of kidney failure treatment that uses the lining of your abdomen (peritoneum) as a natural filter to remove waste and excess fluid from your body. There are two main types of peritoneal dialysis: continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) and automated peritoneal dialysis (APD).\n\nTreatment methods for peritoneal dialysis include:\n\n1. Training: Before starting peritoneal dialysis, you will receive training on how to perform the procedure at home. This includes learning how to insert the catheter, perform exchanges (the process of filling and draining the abdomen with dialysis solution), and care for the catheter site.\n2. Dialysis solution: A sterile dialysis solution is used to clean the blood of waste and excess fluid. The solution contains a mixture of glucose, electrolytes, and water. The glucose in the solution helps to remove waste and excess fluid from the body by creating an osmotic pressure gradient.\n3. Catheter: A soft, flexible tube called a catheter is inserted into the abdomen during a short surgical procedure. The catheter is used to fill the abdomen with dialysis solution and drain the used solution.\n4. Exchanges: In CAPD, exchanges are typically done manually, 4-5 times per day, while the patient is awake and mobile. In APD, a machine called a cycler performs the exchanges automatically, usually while the patient sleeps.\n5. Diet and fluid restrictions: Patients on peritoneal dialysis may need to follow a special diet and limit their fluid intake to help control the buildup of waste...\n\n    Scoring guide:\n    1.

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: What to do for Treatment Methods for Kidney Failure: Peritoneal Dialysis?\n\n    Reference Answer: Eating the right foods can help you feel better while on peritoneal dialysis. Talk with your dialysis centers dietitian to find a meal plan that works for you. Your dietary needs will depend on your treatment and other factors such as your weight and activity level. Staying healthy with CKD requires watching what is in your diet:\n                \n- Protein is in foods from animals and plants. Protein provides the building blocks that maintain and repair muscles, organs, and other parts of your body. Peritoneal dialysis can remove proteins from your body, so eat high-quality, protein-rich foods such as meat, fish, and eggs. However, many high-protein foods also contain phosphorous, which can weaken your bones. Talk with your dietitian about ways to get the protein you need without getting too much phosphorous.  - Phosphorus is a mineral that helps your bones stay healthy and your blood vessels and muscles work. Phosphorus is a natural part of foods rich in protein, and food producers often add it to many processed foods. Phosphorus can weaken your bones and make your skin itch if you consume too much. Peritoneal dialysis may not remove enough phosphorus from your body, so you will probably need to limit or avoid high-phosphorus foods such as milk and cheese, dried beans, peas, colas, nuts, and peanut butter. You may also need to take a pill called a phosphate binder that keeps phosphorus in your food from entering your bloodstream.  - Fluid includes water and drinks such as fruit juice and milk and water in foods such as fruits, vegetables, ice cream, gelatin, soup, and ice pops. You need water for your body to function properly; however, too much can cause swelling and make your heart work harder. Over time, having too much fluid in your body can cause high blood pressure and congestive heart failure. Peritoneal dialysis might cause you to have either too much or too little fluid, depending on the strength of the solution you use. Your diet can also influence whether you have too much or too little fluid. Your dietitian will help you determine how much liquid you need to consume each day.  - Sodium is a part of salt. Many canned, packaged, frozen, and fast foods contain sodium. Sodium is also a part of many condiments, seasonings, and meats. Too much sodium makes you thirsty, which makes you drink more liquid. Try to eat fresh foods that are naturally low in sodium, and look for products that say low sodium on the label, especially in canned and frozen foods.  - Potassium is a mineral that helps your nerves and muscles work the right way. Peritoneal dialysis can pull too much potassium from your blood, so you may need to eat more high-potassium foods such as bananas, oranges, potatoes, and tomatoes. However, be careful not to eat too much potassium. Your dietitian will help you choose the right amount.  - Calories are units for measuring the energy provided by foods and drinks. Eating foods with too many calories, such as oily and sugary foods, can make you gain weight. Your body can absorb the dextrose from your dialysis solution, which can increase your calorie intake. You may find you need to take in fewer calories to prevent weight gain. Your dietitian can help you create and follow a diet to stay at a healthy weight.  - Supplements help provide some of the vitamins and minerals that may be missing from your diet. Peritoneal dialysis also removes some vitamins from your body. Your doctor may prescribe a vitamin and mineral supplement that scientists have designed specifically for people with CKD and kidney failure. Never take vitamin and...\n\n    Generated Answer: Peritoneal dialysis is a type of kidney failure treatment that uses the lining of your abdomen (peritoneum) as a natural filter to remove waste and excess fluid from your body. Here are some general steps for peritoneal dialysis:\n\n1. A catheter is surgically placed in your abdomen.\n2. Dialysate solution is introduced into your abdomen through the catheter.\n3. The solution remains in your abdomen for a specified period, allowing waste and excess fluid to move from your blood into the solution.\n4. The solution is then drained from your abdomen and discarded.\n\nThere are two main types of peritoneal dialysis:\n\n1. Continuous Ambulatory Peritoneal Dialysis (CAPD): You manually perform exchanges (drain and refill) several times a day while going about your daily activities.\n2. Automated Peritoneal Dialysis (APD): A machine automatically performs exchanges for you, usually during sleep.\n\nRegardless of the type, it's essential to follow your healthcare provider's instructions for peritoneal...\n\n    Scoring guide:\n    1.

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: How to diagnose Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome in Children?\n\n    Reference Answer: A health care provider diagnoses hemolytic uremic syndrome with\n                \n- a medical and family history  - a physical exam  - urine tests  - a blood test  - a stool test  - kidney biopsy\n                \nMedical and Family History\n                \nTaking a medical and family history is one of the first things a health care provider may do to help diagnose hemolytic uremic syndrome.\n                \nPhysical Exam\n                \nA physical exam may help diagnose hemolytic uremic syndrome. During a physical exam, a health care provider most often\n                \n- examines a child's body  - taps on specific areas of the child's body\n                \nUrine Tests\n                \nA health care provider may order the following urine tests to help determine if a child has kidney damage from hemolytic uremic syndrome.\n                \nDipstick test for albumin. A dipstick test performed on a urine sample can detect the presence of albumin in the urine, which could mean kidney damage. The child or caretaker collects a urine sample in a special container in a health care provider's office or a commercial facility. For the test, a nurse or technician places a strip of chemically treated paper, called a dipstick, into the child's urine sample. Patches on the dipstick change color when albumin is present in the urine.\n                \nUrine albumin-to-creatinine ratio. A health care provider uses this measurement to estimate the amount of albumin passed into the urine over a 24-hour period. The child provides a urine sample during an appointment with the health care provider. Creatinine is a waste product that is filtered in the kidneys and passed in the urine. A high urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio indicates that the kidneys are leaking large amounts of albumin into the urine.\n                \nBlood Test\n                \nA blood test involves drawing blood at a health care provider's office or a commercial facility and sending the sample to a lab for analysis. A health care provider will test the blood sample to\n                \n- estimate how much blood the kidneys filter eachminute, called the estimated glomerular filtrationrate, or eGFR. The test results help the healthcare provider determine the amount of kidneydamage from hemolytic uremic syndrome.  - check red blood cell and platelet levels.  - check for liver and kidney function.  - assess protein levels in the blood.\n                \nStool Test\n                \nA stool test is the analysis of a sample of stool. The health care provider will give the child's parent or caretaker a container for catching and storing the stool. The parent or caretaker returns the sample to the health care provider or a commercial facility that will send the sample to a lab for analysis. Stool tests can show the presence of E. coli O157:H7.\n                \nKidney Biopsy\n                \nBiopsy is a procedure that involves taking a small piece...\n\n    Generated Answer: Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS) in children is typically diagnosed through a combination of medical history, physical examination, and laboratory tests. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Medical History: The doctor will ask about the child's symptoms, recent infections, family history of kidney disease, and any medications they are currently taking.\n\n2. Physical Examination: The doctor will perform a physical examination to check for signs of HUS, such as high blood pressure, swelling in the legs or arms, and bruising or pallor in the skin.\n\n3. Laboratory Tests: If HUS is suspected, the doctor will order laboratory tests to confirm the diagnosis. These tests may include:\n\n   a. Complete Blood Count (CBC): This test measures the number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets in the blood. In HUS, the number of red blood cells is usually low, and the number of platelets is usually high.\n\n   b. Coagulation Tests: These tests measure the time it takes for the blood to clot. In HUS, the clotting time may be prolonged.\n\n   c. Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) and Creatinine: These tests measure the levels of waste products in the blood. In HUS, the levels of these waste products are usually elevated.\n\n   d. Peripheral Blood Smear: This test looks for signs of hemolysis (the breakdown of red blood cells) in the blood. In HUS, the blood smear may show fragmented red blood cells.\n\n   e. Urinalysis: This test checks the urine for signs of protein and blood. In HUS, the urine may contain both.\n\n   f. Stool Culture: This test checks...\n\n    Scoring guide:\n    1. Scientific Consensus: 1=Aligned, 0=No consensus, -1=Opposed\n    2. Inappropriate Content: 0=None, -1=Minor, -2=Major  \n    3.

Missing Content: -1 \n\n    Overall score: 0\n\n    Reviewer comments: The generated answer is mostly aligned with the reference answer but lacks some details and clarity. It would benefit from rephrasing and adding more specific information about the diagnostic process for Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome in children.",

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: What are the treatments for Primary Hyperparathyroidism?\n\n    Reference Answer: Surgery\n                \nSurgery to remove the overactive parathyroid gland or glands is the only definitive treatment for the disorder, particularly if the patient has a very high blood calcium level or has had a fracture or a kidney stone. In patients without any symptoms, guidelines are used to identify who might benefit from parathyroid surgery.3\n                \nWhen performed by experienced endocrine surgeons, surgery cures primary hyperparathyroidism in more than 95 percent of operations.2\n                \nSurgeons often use imaging tests before surgery to locate the overactive gland to be removed. The most commonly used tests are sestamibi and ultrasound scans. In a sestamibi scan, the patient receives an injection of a small amount of radioactive dye that is absorbed by overactive parathyroid glands. The overactive glands can then be viewed using a special camera.\n                \nSurgeons use two main strategies to remove the overactive gland or glands:\n                \n- Minimally invasive parathyroidectomy. This type of surgery, which can be done on an outpatient basis, may be used when only one of the parathyroid glands is likely to be overactive. Guided by a tumor-imaging test, the surgeon makes a small incision in the neck to remove the gland. The small incision means that patients typically have less pain and a quicker recovery than with more invasive surgery. Local or general anesthesia may be used for this type of surgery.  - Standard neck exploration. This type of surgery involves a larger incision that allows the surgeon to access and examine all four parathyroid glands and remove the overactive ones. This type of surgery is more extensive and typically requires a hospital stay of 1 to 2 days. Surgeons use this approach if they plan to inspect more than one gland. General anesthesia is used for this type of surgery.\n                \nAlmost all people with primary hyperparathyroidism who have symptoms can benefit from surgery. Experts believe that those without symptoms but who meet guidelines for surgery will also benefit from surgery. Surgery can lead to improved bone density and fewer fractures and can reduce the chance of forming kidney stones. Other potential benefits are being studied by researchers.\n                \nSurgery for primary hyperparathyroidism has a complication rate of 13 percent when performed by experienced endocrine surgeons.4 Rarely, patients undergoing surgery experience damage to the nerves controlling the vocal cords, which can affect speech. A small number of patients lose all their healthy parathyroid tissue and thus develop chronic low calcium levels, requiring lifelong treatment with calcium and some form of vitamin D. This complication is called hypoparathyroidism. The complication rate is slightly higher for operations on multiple tumors than for a single adenoma because more extensive surgery is needed.\n                \nPeople with primary hyperparathyroidism due to familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia should not have surgery.\n                \nMonitoring\n                \nSome people who have mild primary hyperparathyroidism may not need immediate or even any surgery and can be safely monitored. People may wish to talk with their health care provider about long-term monitoring if they\n                \n- are symptom-free  - have only slightly elevated blood calcium levels  - have normal kidneys and bone density\n                \nLong-term monitoring should include periodic clinical evaluations, annual serum calcium measurements, annual serum creatinine measurements to check kidney function, and bone density measurements every 1 to 2 years.\n                \nVitamin D deficiency should be corrected if present. Patients who are monitored need not restrict calcium in their diets.\n                \nIf the patient and health care provider choose long-term monitoring, the patient should\n                \n- drink plenty of water  - exercise regularly  - avoid certain diuretics, such as thiazides\n                \nEither immobilizationthe inability to move due to illness or injuryor gastrointestinal illness with vomiting or diarrhea that leads to dehydration can cause blood calcium levels to rise further in someone with primary hyperparathyroidism. People with primary hyperparathyroidism should seek medical attention if they find themselves immobilized or dehydrated due to vomiting or diarrhea.\n                \nMedications\n                \nCalcimimetics are a new class of medications that decrease parathyroid gland secretion of PTH.

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: What causes Urine Blockage in Newborns?\n\n    Reference Answer: Many types of defects in the urinary tract can cause urine blockage:\n                \n- Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). Most children with VUR are born with a ureter that did not grow long enough during development in the womb. The valve formed by the ureter pressing against the bladder wall does not close properly, so urine backs uprefluxesfrom the bladder to the ureter and eventually to the kidney. Severe reflux may prevent a kidney from developing normally and may increase the risk for damage from infections after birth. VUR usually affects only one ureter and kidney, though it can affect both ureters and kidneys.  - Ureteropelvic junction (UPJ) obstruction. If urine is blocked where the ureter joins the kidney, only the kidney swells. The ureter remains a normal size. UPJ obstruction usually occurs in only one kidney.\n                \n- Bladder outlet obstruction (BOO). BOO describes any blockage in the urethra or at the opening of the bladder.Posterior urethral valves (PUV), the most common form of BOO seen in newborns and during prenatal ultrasound exams, is a birth defect in boys in which an abnormal fold of tissue in the urethra keeps urine from flowing freely out of the bladder. This defect may cause swelling in the entire urinary tract, including the urethra, bladder, ureters, and kidneys.  - Ureterocele. If the end of the ureter does not develop normally, it can bulge, creating a ureterocele. The ureterocele may obstruct part of the ureter or the bladder.\n                \nSome babies are born with genetic conditions that affect several different systems in the body, including the urinary tract:\n                \n- Prune belly syndrome (PBS). PBS is a group of birth defects involving poor development of the abdominal muscles, enlargement of the ureters and bladder, and both testicles remaining inside the body instead of descending into the scrotum. The skin over the abdomen is wrinkled, giving the appearance of a prune. PBS usually occurs in boys, and most children with PBS have hydronephrosisswelling in the kidneyand VUR.  - Esophageal atresia (EA). EA is a birth defect in which the esophagusthe muscular tube that carries food and liquids from the mouth to the stomachlacks the opening for food to pass into the stomach. Babies born with EA may also have problems with their spinal columns, digestive systems, hearts, and urinary tracts.  - Congenital heart defects. Heart defects range from mild to life threatening. Children born with heart defects also have a higher rate of problems in the urinary tract than children in the general population, suggesting that some...\n\n    Generated Answer: Urine blockage in...\n\n    Scoring guide:\n    1.

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: How to diagnose Urine Blockage in Newborns?\n\n    Reference Answer: Defects of the urinary tract may be diagnosed before or after the baby is born.\n                \nDiagnosis before Birth\n                \nTests during pregnancy can help determine if the baby is developing normally in the womb.\n                \n- Ultrasound. Ultrasound uses a device, called a transducer, that bounces safe, painless sound waves off organs to create an image of their structure. A prenatal ultrasound can show internal organs within the baby. The procedure is performed in a health care providers office, outpatient center, or hospital by a specially trained technician, and the images are interpreted by     - a radiologista doctor who specializes in medical imaging, or    - an obstetriciana doctor who delivers babies\n                \nThe images can show enlarged kidneys, ureters, or bladders in babies.\n                \n- Amniocentesis. Amniocentesis is a procedure in which amniotic fluid is removed from the mothers womb for testing. The procedure can be performed in the health care providers office, and local anesthetic may be used. The health care provider inserts a thin needle through the abdomen into the uterus to obtain a small amount of amniotic fluid. Cells from the fluid are grown in a lab and then analyzed. The health care provider usually uses ultrasound to find the exact location of the baby. The test can show whether the baby has certain birth defects and how well the babys lungs are developing.  - Chorionic villus sampling (CVS). CVS is the removal of a small piece of tissue from the placenta for testing. The procedure can be performed in the health care providers office; anesthesia is not needed. The health care provider uses ultrasound to guide a thin tube or needle through the vagina or abdomen into the placenta. Cells are removed from the placenta and then analyzed. The test can show whether the baby has certain genetic defects.\n                \nMost healthy women do not need all of these tests. Ultrasound exams during pregnancy are routine. Amniocentesis and CVS are recommended only when a risk of genetic problems exists because of family history or a problem is detected during an ultrasound. Amniocentesis and CVS carry a slight risk of harming the baby and mother or ending the pregnancy in miscarriage, so the risks should be carefully considered.\n                \nDiagnosis after Birth\n                \nDifferent imaging techniques can be used in infants and children to determine the cause of urine blockage.\n                \n- Ultrasound. Ultrasound can be used to view the childs urinary tract. For infants, the image is clearer than could be achieved while the baby was in the womb.  - Voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG). VCUG is an x-ray image of the bladder and urethra taken while the bladder is full and during urination, also called voiding. The procedure is performed in an outpatient center or hospital by an x-ray technician supervised by a radiologist, who then interprets the images. While anesthesia is not needed, sedation may be used for some children. The bladder and urethra are filled with a special dye, called contrast medium, to make the structures clearly visible on the x-ray images. The x-ray machine captures images of the contrast medium while the bladder is full and when the child urinates. The test can show reflux or blockage of the bladder due to an obstruction, such as PUV.  - Radionuclide scan. A radionuclide scan is an imaging technique that detects small amounts of radiation after a person is injected with radioactive chemicals. The...\n\n    Generated Answer: A urine blockage in newborns, also known as ureteropelvic junction (UPJ) obstruction, is typically diagnosed through the following steps:\n\n1. Physical Examination: A healthcare provider will perform a physical exam to check for any visible abnormalities in the newborn's abdomen.\n2. Imaging Tests: If a physical exam suggests a urine blockage, the doctor may order imaging tests such as an ultrasound, VCUG (voiding cystourethrogram), or a MAG3 (mercaptoacetyltriglycine) scan to get a better look at the urinary tract and determine the location and severity...\n\n    Scoring guide:\n    1.

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: Who is at risk for Urinary Tract Infection In Adults??\n\n    Reference Answer: Although everyone has some risk, some people are more prone to getting UTIs than others. People with spinal cord injuries or other nerve damage around the bladder have difficulty emptying their bladder completely, allowing bacteria to grow in the urine that stays in the bladder. Anyone with an abnormality of the urinary tract that obstructs the flow of urinea kidney stone or enlarged prostate, for exampleis at risk for a UTI. People with diabetes or problems with the bodys natural defense system are more likely to get UTIs.\n                \nSexual activity can move microbes from the bowel or vaginal cavity to the urethral opening. If these microbes have special characteristics that allow them to live in the urinary tract, it is harder for the body to remove them quickly enough to prevent infection. Following sexual intercourse, most women have a significant number of bacteria in their urine, but the body normally clears them within 24 hours. However, some forms of birth control increase the risk of UTI. In some women, certain spermicides may irritate the skin, increasing the risk of bacteria invading surrounding tissues. Using a diaphragm may slow urinary flow and allow bacteria to multiply. Condom use is also associated with increased risk of UTIs, possibly because of the increased trauma that occurs to the vagina during sexual activity. Using spermicides with diaphragms and condoms can increase risk even further.\n                \nAnother common source of infection is catheters, or tubes, placed in the urethra and bladder. Catheters interfere with the bodys ability to clear microbes from the urinary tract. Bacteria travel through or around the catheter and establish a place where they can thrive within the bladder. A person who cannot urinate in the normal way or who is unconscious or critically ill often needs a catheter for more than a few days. The Infectious Diseases Society of America recommends using catheters for the shortest time possible to reduce the risk of a UTI.3\n                \nRecurrent Infections\n                \nMany women suffer from frequent UTIs. About 20 percent of young women with a first UTI will have a recurrent infection.4 With each UTI, the risk that a woman will continue having recurrent UTIs increases.5 Some women have three or more UTIs a year. However, very few women will have frequent infections throughout their lives. More typically, a woman will have a period of 1 or 2 years with frequent infections, after which recurring infections cease.\n                \nMen are less likely than women to have a first UTI. But once a man has a UTI, he is likely to have another because bacteria can hide deep inside prostate tissue. Anyone who has diabetes or a problem that makes it hard to urinate may have repeat infections.\n                \nResearch funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) suggests that one factor behind recurrent UTIs may be the ability of bacteria to attach to cells lining the urinary tract. One NIH-funded study found that bacteria formed a protective film on the inner lining of the bladder in mice.6 If a similar process can be demonstrated in humans, the discovery may lead to new treatments to prevent recurrent UTIs. Another line of research has indicated that women who are nonsecretors of certain blood group antigens may be more prone to recurrent UTIs because the cells lining the vagina and urethra may allow bacteria to attach more easily. A nonsecretor is a person with an A, B, or AB blood type who does not secrete the normal antigens for that blood type in bodily fluids, such as fluids that line the bladder wall.7\n                \nInfections during Pregnancy\n                \nPregnant women seem no more prone to UTIs than other women. However, when a...\n\n    Generated Answer: People at risk for urinary tract infections (UTIs) in adulthood include:\n\n1. Women: Women have a shorter urethra than men, which makes it easier for bacteria to reach the bladder and cause an infection.\n2. Sexual activity: Sexual intercourse can introduce bacteria into the urinary tract, increasing the risk of UTIs.\n3. Use of diaphragms or spermicides: These can increase the risk of UTIs in women.\n4. People with urinary tract abnormalities: Structural or functional abnormalities in the urinary tract can increase the risk of UTIs.\n5. People with suppressed immune systems: A weakened immune system can make it harder for the body to fight off infections.\n6. People with diabetes: People with...\n\n    Scoring guide:\n    1.

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: How to diagnose Urinary Tract Infection In Adults?\n\n    Reference Answer: To find out whether a person has a UTI, the health care provider will ask about urinary symptoms and then test a sample of urine for the presence of bacteria and white blood cells, which are produced by the body to fight infection. Because bacteria can be found in the urine of healthy individuals, a UTI is diagnosed based both on symptoms and a laboratory test. The person will be asked to give a clean catch urine sample by washing the genital area and collecting a midstream sample of urine in a sterile container. This method of collecting urine helps prevent bacteria around the genital area from getting into the sample and confusing the test results. Usually, the sample is sent to a laboratory, although some health care providers offices are equipped to do the testing. For people with recurring infections and patients in the hospital, the urine may be cultured. The culture is performed by placing part of the urine sample in a tube or dish with a substance that encourages any bacteria present to grow. Once the bacteria have multiplied, which usually takes 1 to 3 days, they can be identified. The health care provider may also order a sensitivity test, which tests the bacteria for sensitivity to different antibiotics to see which medication is best for treating the infection.\n                \nIf a person has recurrent UTIs, the health care provider may order some additional tests to determine if the persons urinary tract is normal.\n                \nKidney and bladder ultrasound. Ultrasound uses a device, called a transducer, that bounces safe, painless sound waves off organs to create an image of their structure. The procedure is performed in a health care providers office, outpatient center, or hospital by a specially trained technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologista doctor who specializes in medical imaging; anesthesia is not needed. The images can show abnormalities in the kidneys and bladder. However, this test cannot reveal all important urinary abnormalities or measure how well the kidneys work.\n                \nVoiding cystourethrogram. This test is an x-ray image of the bladder and urethra taken while the bladder is full and during urination, also called voiding. As the person lies on the x-ray table, a health care provider inserts the tip of a thin, flexible tube called a catheter through the urethra into the bladder. The bladder and urethra are filled with a special dye called contrast medium, to make the structures clearly visible on the x-ray images. The x rays are taken from various angles while the bladder is full of contrast medium. The catheter is then removed and x-ray images are taken during urination. The procedure is performed in a health care providers office, outpatient center, or hospital by an x-ray technician. The technician is supervised by a radiologist while the images are taken. The radiologist then interprets the images. Anesthesia is not needed, but light sedation may be used for some people. This test can show abnormalities of the inside of the urethra and bladder. The test can also determine whether the flow of urine is normal when the bladder empties.\n                \nComputerized tomography (CT) scan. CT scans use a combination of x rays and computer technology to create three-dimensional (3-D) images. A CT scan may include the injection of contrast medium. CT scans require the person to lie on a table that slides into a tunnel-shaped device where the x rays are taken. The procedure is performed in an outpatient center or hospital by an x-ray technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologist; anesthesia is not needed. CT scans can provide clearer, more detailed images to help the health care provider understand the problem.\n                \nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI machines use radio waves and magnets to produce detailed pictures of the bodys internal organs and soft tissues without using x rays. An MRI may include an injection of contrast medium. With most MRI machines, the person lies on a table that slides into a tunnel-shaped device that may be open ended or closed at one end; some newer machines are designed to allow the person to lie in a more open space. The procedure is performed in an outpatient center or hospital by a specially trained technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologist; anesthesia is not needed though light sedation may be used for people with a fear of confined spaces. Like CT scans, MRIs can provide clearer, more detailed images.\n                \nRadionuclide scan. A radionuclide scan is an imaging technique that relies on the detection of small amounts of radiation after injection of radioactive chemicals. Because the dose of the radioactive chemicals is small, the risk of causing damage to cells is low. Special cameras and computers are used to create images of the radioactive chemicals as they pass through the kidneys. Radionuclide scans are performed in a health care providers office, outpatient center, or hospital by a specially trained technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologist; anesthesia is not needed. These scans can show how well the kidneys function and whether there is any abnormality in the shape or size of the kidneys and whether there is any evidence of blockage to the flow of urine in the urinary tract.\n                \nUrodynamic tests. Urodynamic tests evaluate the storage function and emptying ability of the lower urinary tractthe bladder and urethra. They can mimic the way the bladder performs in everyday life. Urodynamic tests are often performed in a urologists office and anesthesia is not needed. Some common urodynamic tests include\n                \nUroflowmetry. This test measures the rate of urine flow. People with a UTI may have a slower-than-normal stream because of swelling in the urethra or bladder muscle spasms.\n                \nPostvoid residual measurements. This test measures the amount of urine left in the bladder after urination and is performed by inserting a catheter through the urethra into the bladder. A large amount of leftover urine in the bladder could be a symptom of a UTI.\n                \nCystometry. This test measures the pressure within the bladder to see how well its muscles contract when the bladder is filling with urine.\n                \nElectromyogram. This test records the activity of the muscles in the pelvic floor, including those of the urethral sphincter. Abnormalities in these muscles may cause problems with the flow of urine.\n                \nVideo urodynamics. This test uses x ray or other imaging equipment to take pictures of the bladder, sphincters, and urethra while the bladder is filling and during urination. The test can identify obstructions in the urinary tract. Light sedation may be used in some cases.\n                \nThe health care provider may also ask the person to keep a diary of when the UTI occurs, how long it lasts, and the severity of symptoms. This information can help the health care provider identify patterns and potential causes of the UTIs.\n                \nIn addition, the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) and other components of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) are sponsoring several studies to better understand the genetic factors involved in UTIs and to develop effective treatments for UTIs. The NIDDK also sponsors research grants to encourage scientists to explore new ways to treat UTIs.\n                \nPeople participating in clinical trials can receive up-to-date information and state-of-the-art care. Clinical trials are primarily conducted in hospitals and clinics, although some private practice doctors may also participate.",

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: What are the treatments for Urinary Tract Infection In Adults?\n\n    Reference Answer: Most UTIs are caused by bacteria, which are treated with bacteria-fighting medications called antibiotics or antimicrobials. The choice of medication and length of treatment depend on the patients history and the type of bacteria causing the infection. Some antibiotics may be ruled out if a person has allergies to them. The sensitivity test takes 48 hours to complete and is especially useful in helping the health care provider select the antibiotic most likely to be effective in treating an infection. Longer treatment may be needed if the first antibiotic given is not effective.\n                \nWhen a UTI occurs in a healthy person with a normal, unobstructed urinary tract, the term uncomplicated is used to describe the infection. Most young women who have UTIs have uncomplicated UTIs, which can be cured with 2 or 3 days of treatment. Single-dose treatment is less effective. Longer treatment causes more side effects and is not more effective. A follow-up urinalysis helps to confirm the urinary tract is infection-free. Taking the full course of treatment is important because symptoms may disappear before the infection is fully cleared.\n                \nComplicated UTIs occur when a personfor example, a pregnant woman or a transplant patientis weakened by another condition. A UTI is also complicated when the person has a structural or functional abnormality of the urinary tract, such as an obstructive kidney stone or prostate enlargement that squeezes the urethra. Health care providers should assume that men and boys have a complicated UTI until proven otherwise.\n                \nSeverely ill patients with kidney infections may be hospitalized until they can take fluids and needed medications on their own. Kidney infections may require several weeks of antibiotic treatment. Kidney infections in adults rarely lead to kidney damage or kidney failure unless they go untreated or are associated with urinary tract obstruction.\n                \nBladder infections are generally self-limiting, but antibiotic treatment significantly shortens the duration of symptoms. People usually feel better within a day or two of treatment. Symptoms of kidney and prostate infections last longer. Drinking lots of fluids and urinating frequently will speed healing. If needed, various medications are available to relieve the pain of a UTI. A heating pad on the back or abdomen may also help.\n                \nRecurrent Infections in Women\n                \nHealth care providers may advise women who have recurrent UTIs to try one of the following treatment options:\n                \n- Take low doses of the prescribed antibiotic daily for 6 months or longer. If taken at bedtime, the medication remains in the bladder longer and may be more effective. NIH-supported research has shown this therapy to be effective without causing serious side effects.  - Take a single dose of an antibiotic after sexual intercourse.  - Take a short course2 or 3 daysof an antibiotic when symptoms appear.\n                \nTo try to prevent an infection, health care providers may suggest women\n                \n- drink plenty of water every day  - urinate when the need arises and avoid resisting the urge to urinate  - urinate after sexual intercourse  - switch to a different method of birth control if recurring UTIs are a problem\n                \nInfections during Pregnancy\n                \nDuring pregnancy, bacterial infection of the urineeven in the absence of symptomscan pose risks to both the mother and the baby. Some antibiotics are not safe to take during pregnancy. In selecting the best treatments, health care providers consider various factors such as the medications effectiveness, the stage of pregnancy, the mothers health, and potential effects on the fetus.\n                \nComplicated Infections\n                \nCuring infections that stem from a urinary obstruction or other systemic disorder depends on finding and correcting the underlying problem, sometimes with surgery. If the root cause goes untreated, this group of patients is at risk for kidney damage. Also, such infections tend to arise from a wider range of bacteria and sometimes from more than one type of bacteria at a time.\n                \nInfections in Men\n                \nUrinary tract infections in men are often the result of an obstructionfor example, a urinary stone or enlarged prostateor are from a catheter used during a medical procedure. The first step in treating such an infection...\n\n    Generated Answer: I'm an assistant and not a doctor, but I can certainly provide some general information about treating urinary tract infections (UTIs) in adults.\n\nUTIs are typically caused by bacteria and are usually treated with antibiotics. The type of antibiotic used and the length of the treatment may depend on the type of bacteria causing the infection and the patient's health condition. Common antibiotics used include trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim, Septra), fosfomycin (Monurol), nitrofurantoin (Macrobid), and ciprofloxacin (Cipro).\n\nIn addition to antibiotics, it's also recommended to drink plenty of water to help flush the bacteria...\n\n    Scoring guide:\n    1.

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: What causes Anemia of Inflammation and Chronic Disease?\n\n    Reference Answer: Anemia of inflammation and chronic disease is caused by red blood cells not functioning normally, so they cannot absorb and use iron efficiently. In addition, the body cannot respond normally to erythropoietin (EPO), a hormone made by the kidneys that stimulates bone marrow to produce red blood cells. Over time, this abnormal functioning causes a lower than normal number of red blood cells in the body.\n                \nSome of the chronic diseases that lead to AI/ACD include infectious and inflammatory diseases, kidney disease, and cancer. Certain treatments for chronic diseases may also impair red blood cell production and contribute to AI/ACD.\n                \nInfectious and inflammatory diseases. As part of the immune system response that occurs with infectious and inflammatory diseases, cells of the immune system release proteins called cytokines. Cytokines help heal the body and defend it against infection. However, they can also affect normal body functions. In AI/ACD, immune cytokines interfere with the bodys ability to absorb and use iron. Cytokines may also interfere with the production and normal activity of EPO.\n                \nInfectious diseases that cause AI/ACD include\n                \n- tuberculosis, an infection in the lungs  - HIV/AIDS, an infection that destroys the immune system  - endocarditis, an infection in the heart  - osteomyelitis, a bone infection\n                \nSometimes, acute infectionsthose that develop quickly and may not last longcan also cause AI/ACD.\n                \nInflammatory diseases that can lead to AI/ACD include\n                \n- rheumatoid arthritis, which causes pain, swelling, stiffness, and loss of function in the joints  - lupus, which causes damage to various body tissues, such as the joints, skin, kidneys, heart, lungs, blood vessels, and brain  - diabetes, in which levels of blood glucose, also called blood sugar, are above normal  - heart failure, in which the heart cannot pump enough blood to meet the bodys needs  - inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), diseases that cause inflammation and irritation in the intestines\n                \nIBD, including Crohns disease, can also cause iron deficiency due to poor absorption of iron by the diseased intestine and bleeding from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract.\n                \nKidney disease. People with kidney disease can develop anemia for several different reasons. Diseased kidneys often fail to make enough EPO. In addition, kidney disease results in abnormal absorption and use of iron, which is typical of AI/ACD. Anemia worsens as kidney disease advances. Therefore, most people with kidney failure have anemia. Kidney failure is described as end-stage kidney disease, sometimes called ESRD, when treated with a kidney transplant or blood-filtering treatments called dialysis.\n                \nPeople with kidney failure can also develop iron deficiency due to blood loss during hemodialysis, a type of dialysis that uses a special filter called a dialyzer to remove wastes from the blood. Low levels of iron and folic acidanother nutrient required for normal...\n\n    Generated Answer: Anemia of Inflammation and Chronic Disease, also known as AICD, is caused by a combination of factors. The underlying condition, such as chronic inflammation or disease, causes the body to produce cytokines, which are proteins that can interfere with the production of red blood cells or the normal functioning of hemoglobin.\n\nAdditionally, the chronic...\n\n    Scoring guide:\n    1.

Infections and medications may also cause the disease.\n                \nAutoimmune Disorders\n                \nUp to 80 percent of Addisons disease cases are caused by an autoimmune disorder, which is when the bodys immune system attacks the bodys own cells and organs.2 In autoimmune Addisons, which mainly occurs in middle-aged females, the immune system gradually destroys the adrenal cortexthe outer layer of the adrenal glands.2\n                \nPrimary adrenal insufficiency occurs when at least 90 percent of the adrenal cortex has been destroyed.1 As a result, both cortisol and aldosterone are often lacking. Sometimes only the adrenal glands are affected. Sometimes other endocrine glands are affected as well, as in polyendocrine deficiency syndrome.\n                \nPolyendocrine deficiency syndrome is classified into type 1 and type 2. Type 1 is inherited and occurs in children. In addition to adrenal insufficiency, these children may have\n                \n- underactive parathyroid glands, which are four pea-sized glands located on or near the thyroid gland in the neck; they produce a hormone that helps maintain the correct balance of calcium in the body.   - slow sexual development.   - pernicious anemia, a severe type of anemia; anemia is a condition in which red blood cells are fewer than normal, which means less oxygen is carried to the bodys cells. With most types of anemia, red blood cells are smaller than normal; however, in pernicious anemia, the cells are bigger than normal.   - chronic fungal infections.   - chronic hepatitis, a liver disease.\n                \nResearchers think type 2, which is sometimes called Schmidts syndrome, is also inherited. Type 2 usually affects young adults and may include\n                \n- an underactive thyroid gland, which produces hormones that regulate metabolism   - slow sexual development   - diabetes, in which a person has high blood glucose, also called high blood sugar or hyperglycemia   - vitiligo, a loss of pigment on areas of the skin\n                \nInfections\n                \nTuberculosis (TB), an infection that can destroy the adrenal glands, accounts for 10 to 15 percent of Addisons disease cases in developed countries.1 When primary adrenal insufficiency was first identified by Dr. Thomas Addison in 1849, TB was the most common cause of the disease. As TB treatment improved, the incidence of Addisons disease due to TB of the adrenal glands greatly decreased. However, recent reports show an increase in Addisons disease from infections such as TB and cytomegalovirus. Cytomegalovirus is a common virus that does not cause symptoms in healthy people; however, it does affect babies in the womb and people who have a weakened immune systemmostly due to HIV/AIDS.2 Other bacterial infections, such as Neisseria meningitidis, which is a cause of meningitis, and fungal infections can also lead to Addisons disease.\n                \nOther Causes\n                \nLess common causes of Addisons disease are\n                \n- cancer cells in the adrenal glands   - amyloidosis, a serious, though rare, group of diseases that occurs when abnormal proteins, called amyloids, build up in the blood and are deposited in tissues and organs   - surgical removal of the adrenal glands   - bleeding into the...\n\n    Generated Answer: Adrenal insufficiency and Addison's disease are caused by a lack of sufficient adrenal hormones, primarily cortisol and aldosterone, produced by the adrenal glands.\n\nAdrenal insufficiency can be caused by damage to the adrenal glands (primary adrenal insufficiency or Addison's disease) or a problem with the pituitary gland or hypothalamus (secondary adrenal insufficiency).\n\nAddison's disease is most commonly caused by...\n\n    Scoring guide:\n    1.

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: How to diagnose Adrenal Insufficiency and Addison's Disease?\n\n    Reference Answer: In its early stages, adrenal insufficiency can be difficult to diagnose. A health care provider may suspect it after reviewing a persons medical history and symptoms.\n                \nA diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency is confirmed through hormonal blood and urine tests. A health care provider uses these tests first to determine whether cortisol levels are too low and then to establish the cause. Imaging studies of the adrenal and pituitary glands can be useful in helping to establish the cause.\n                \nA lab technician performs the following tests in a health care providers office, a commercial facility, or a hospital.\n                \nHormonal Blood and Urine Tests\n                \n- ACTH stimulation test. The ACTH stimulation test is the most commonly used test for diagnosing adrenal insufficiency. In this test, the patient is given an intravenous (IV) injection of synthetic ACTH, and samples of blood, urine, or both are taken before and after the injection. The cortisol levels in the blood and urine samples are measured in a lab. The normal response after an ACTH injection is a rise in blood and urine cortisol levels. People with Addisons disease or longstanding secondary adrenal insufficiency have little or no increase in cortisol levels.  Both low- and high-dose ACTH stimulation tests may be used depending on the suspected cause of adrenal insufficiency. For example, if secondary adrenal insufficiency is mild or has only recently occurred, the adrenal glands may still respond to ACTH because they have not yet shut down their own production of hormone. Some studies have suggested a low dose1 microgram (mcg)may be more effective in detecting secondary adrenal insufficiency because the low dose is still enough to raise cortisol levels in healthy people, yet not in people with mild or recent secondary adrenal insufficiency. However, recent research has shown that a significant proportion of healthy children and adults can fail the low-dose test, which may lead to unnecessary treatment. Therefore, some health care providers favor using a 250 mcg ACTH test for more accurate results.   - CRH stimulation test. When the response to the ACTH test is abnormal, a CRH stimulation test can help determine the cause of adrenal insufficiency. In this test, the patient is given an IV injection of synthetic CRH, and blood is taken before and 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes after the injection. The cortisol levels in the blood samples are measured in a lab. People with Addisons disease respond by producing high levels of ACTH, yet no cortisol. People with secondary adrenal insufficiency do not produce ACTH or have a delayed response. CRH will not stimulate ACTH secretion if the pituitary is damaged, so no ACTH response points to the pituitary as the cause. A delayed ACTH response points to the hypothalamus as the cause.\n                \nDiagnosis during Adrenal Crisis\n                \nAlthough a reliable...\n\n    Generated Answer: Adrenal insufficiency and Addison's disease are diagnosed through a combination of medical history, physical examination, and diagnostic tests.\n\nA healthcare provider will typically start by taking a medical history, asking about symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, weight loss, and gastrointestinal issues. They may also perform a physical examination to check for signs of adrenal insufficiency, such as low blood pressure, hyperpigmentation of the skin, and decreased muscle mass.\n\nDiagnostic tests are then used to confirm the diagnosis. These may include:\n\n1. Blood tests: These can measure levels of cortisol and other hormones produced by the adrenal glands. Low levels of cortisol may indicate adrenal insufficiency.\n2. ACTH stimulation test: This test measures the body's response to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), which stimulates the adrenal glands to produce cortisol. In this test, a healthcare provider will give a injection of synthetic ACTH and then measure cortisol levels in the blood at various intervals.\n3. CRH stimulation test: This test measures the body's response to corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), which stimulates the release of ACTH. In this test, a healthcare provider will give a injection of CRH and then measure ACTH and cortisol levels in the blood at various...\n\n    Scoring guide:\n    1.

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: What are the treatments for Porphyria?\n\n    Reference Answer: Treatment for porphyria depends on the type of porphyria the person has and the severity of the symptoms.\n                \nAcute Porphyrias\n                \nA health care provider treats acute porphyrias with heme or glucose loading to decrease the livers production of porphyrins and porphyrin precursors. A patient receives heme intravenously once a day for 4 days. Glucose loading involves giving a patient a glucose solution by mouth or intravenously. Heme is usually more effective and is the treatment of choice unless symptoms are mild. In rare instances, if symptoms are severe, a health care provider will recommend liver transplantation to treat acute porphyria. In liver transplantation, a surgeon removes a diseased or an injured liver and replaces it with a healthy, whole liver or a segment of a liver from another person, called a donor. A patient has liver transplantation surgery in a hospital under general anesthesia. Liver transplantation can cure liver failure. More information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Liver Transplantation.\n                \nCutaneous Porphyrias\n                \nThe most important step a person can take to treat a cutaneous porphyria is to avoid sunlight as much as possible. Other cutaneous porphyrias are treated as follows:\n                \n- Porphyria cutanea tarda. A health care provider treats porphyria cutanea tarda by removing factors that tend to activate the disease and by performing repeated therapeutic phlebotomies to reduce iron in the liver. Therapeutic phlebotomy is the removal of about a pint of blood from a vein in the arm. A technician performs the procedure at a blood donation center, such as a hospital, clinic, or bloodmobile. A patient does not require anesthesia. Another treatment approach is low-dose hydroxychloroquine tablets to reduce porphyrins in the liver.  - Erythropoietic protoporphyria. People with erythropoietic protoporphyria may be given beta-carotene or cysteine to improve sunlight tolerance, though these medications do not lower porphyrin levels. Experts recommend hepatitis A and B vaccines and avoiding alcohol to prevent protoporphyric liver failure. A health care provider may use liver transplantation or a combination of medications to treat people who develop liver failure. Unfortunately, liver transplantation does not correct the primary defect, which is the continuous overproduction of protoporphyria by bone marrow. Successful bone marrow transplantations may successfully cure erythropoietic protoporphyria. A health care provider only considers bone marrow transplantation if the disease is severe and leading to secondary liver disease.  - Congenital erythropoietic porphyria and hepatoerythropoietic porphyria. People with congenital erythropoietic porphyria or hepatoerythropoietic porphyria may need surgery to remove the spleen or blood transfusions to treat anemia. A surgeon removes the spleen in a hospital, and a patient receives general anesthesia. With a blood transfusion, a patient receives blood through an intravenous (IV) line inserted into a vein. A technician performs the procedure at a...\n\n    Generated Answer: Porphyria is a group of rare disorders that affect the skin or nervous system. Treatment for porphyria depends on the type and severity of the condition. Here are some common treatments:\n\n1. Avoiding triggers: Identifying and avoiding triggers such as certain medications, alcohol, smoking, and stress can help manage symptoms.\n2. Pain management: Pain relievers, including opioids, may be used to treat severe pain.\n3. Hemin therapy: Intravenous (IV) infusions of hemin, a form of heme, can help reduce symptoms of acute porphyria attacks.\n4. Glucose: Intravenous glucose can help manage symptoms of acute porphyria...\n\n    Scoring guide:\n    1. Scientific Consensus: 1=Aligned, 0=No consensus, -1=Opposed\n    2.

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: What are the treatments for Treatment Methods for Kidney Failure: Hemodialysis?\n\n    Reference Answer: Your kidneys do much more than remove wastes and extra fluid. They also make hormones and balance chemicals in your system. When your kidneys stop working, you may have problems with anemia and conditions that affect your bones, nerves, and skin. Some of the more common conditions caused by kidney failure are extreme tiredness, bone problems, joint problems, itching, and \"restless legs.\" Restless legs will keep you awake as you feel them twitching and jumping.\n                \nAnemia and Erythropoietin (EPO)\n                \nAnemia is a condition in which the volume of red blood cells is low. Red blood cells carry oxygen to cells throughout the body. Without oxygen, cells can't use the energy from food, so someone with anemia may tire easily and look pale. Anemia can also contribute to heart problems.\n                \nAnemia is common in people with kidney disease because the kidneys produce the hormone erythropoietin, or EPO, which stimulates the bone marrow to produce red blood cells. Diseased kidneys often don't make enough EPO, and so the bone marrow makes fewer red blood cells. EPO is available commercially and is commonly given to patients on dialysis.\n                \nFor more information about the causes of and treatments for anemia in kidney failure, see the NIDDK fact sheet Anemia in Chronic Kidney Disease.\n                \nRenal Osteodystrophy\n                \nThe term \"renal\" describes things related to the kidneys. Renal osteodystrophy, or bone disease of kidney failure, affects 90 percent of dialysis patients. It causes bones to become thin and weak or formed incorrectly and affects both children and adults. Symptoms can be seen in growing children with kidney disease even before they start dialysis. Older patients and women who have gone through menopause are at greater risk for this disease.\n                \nFor more information about the causes of this bone disease and its treatment in dialysis patients, see the NIDDK fact sheet Chronic Kidney Disease-Mineral and Bone Disorder.\n                \nItching (Pruritus)\n                \nMany people treated with hemodialysis complain of itchy skin, which is often worse during or just after treatment. Itching is common even in people who don't have kidney disease; in kidney failure, however, itching can be made worse by wastes in the bloodstream that current dialyzer membranes can't remove from the blood.\n                \nThe problem can also be related to high levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH). Some people have found dramatic relief after having their parathyroid glands removed. The four parathyroid glands sit on the outer surface of the thyroid gland, which is located on the windpipe in the base of your neck, just above the collarbone. The parathyroid glands help control the levels of calcium and phosphorus in the blood.\n                \nBut a cure for itching that works for everyone has not been found. Phosphate binders seem to help some people; these medications act like sponges to soak up, or bind, phosphorus while it is in the stomach. Others find relief after exposure to ultraviolet light. Still others improve with EPO shots. A few antihistamines (Benadryl, Atarax, Vistaril) have been found to help; also, capsaicin cream applied to the skin may relieve itching by deadening nerve impulses. In any case, taking care of dry skin is important. Applying creams with lanolin or camphor may help.\n                \nSleep Disorders\n                \nPatients on dialysis often have insomnia, and some people have a specific problem called the sleep apnea syndrome, which is often signaled by snoring and breaks in snoring. Episodes of apnea are actually breaks in breathing during sleep. Over time, these sleep disturbances can lead to \"day-night reversal\" (insomnia at night, sleepiness during the day), headache, depression, and decreased alertness. The apnea may be related to the effects of advanced kidney failure on the control of breathing. Treatments that work with people who have sleep apnea, whether they have kidney failure or not, include losing weight, changing sleeping position, and wearing a mask that gently pumps air continuously into the nose (nasal continuous positive airway pressure, or CPAP).\n                \nMany people on dialysis have trouble sleeping at night because of aching, uncomfortable, jittery, or \"restless\" legs. You may feel a strong impulse to kick or thrash your legs. Kicking may occur during sleep and disturb a bed partner throughout the night. The causes of restless legs may include nerve damage or chemical imbalances.\n                \nModerate exercise during the day may help, but exercising a few hours before bedtime can make it worse. People with restless leg syndrome should reduce or avoid caffeine, alcohol, and tobacco; some people also find relief with massages or warm baths. A unit dose of a benzodiazepine, such as clonazepam, helps some people.\n                \nNerve Problems\n                \nPeople with advanced kidney failure often have numbness or tingling sensations in their feet. Some have painful burning sensations in their toes. The symptoms result from nerve damage, usually as a complication of diabetes, but may be due to the buildup of wastes resulting from inadequate dialysis. These sensations can be symptoms of a peripheral neuropathy. Peripheral neuropathy is a disease that affects nerve function, causing weakness, numbness, and pain, usually in your hands and feet. It is sometimes related to lower levels of myoinositol, a carbohydrate.\n                \nSome studies suggest that myoinositol supplements can reduce numbness and other symptoms of peripheral neuropathy. For reasons that aren't well understood, people receiving peritoneal dialysis don't seem to develop neuropathy. Researchers believe that the type of dialysis solution used might protect their nerves.\n                \nSkin Problems\n                \nSkin can become very dry if you're on dialysis. Moisturizers can help prevent dry skin; ask your doctor to recommend one that's right for you. Some over-the-counter moisturizers contain PABA, which can build up to toxic levels in people with poor kidney function. Other products containing urea can increase the odor of urine.\n                \nIn addition, calciphylaxis is a rare but serious condition where the small blood vessels under the skin begin to harden and narrow. Although scientists know little about what triggers the condition, they think it may be initiated by trauma, with subsequent episodes triggered by dialysis. Calciphylaxis has no known cure; researchers are exploring different treatments, including bisphosphonates, which are drugs that block the activity of certain minerals in the body.\n                \nDental Problems\n                \nTooth decay and gum disease are more common in people with advanced kidney disease than in the general population. If you have kidney disease, you should brush and floss your teeth regularly. Regular dental checkups are crucial for preventing these problems. Gum disease results from infections in the mouth. To fight infection, your body produces substances that cause inflammation and damage surrounding tissues. Research has shown that treating periodontal disease can decrease inflammation in the entire body.\n                \nHormonal Imbalance\n                \nKidneys produce several important hormones, including renin, angiotensin, aldosterone, and erythropoietin. Hormones regulate various bodily functions, such as maintaining healthy blood pressure, producing red blood cells, and keeping your bones",

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: What causes Cushing's Syndrome?\n\n    Reference Answer: Cushing's syndrome occurs when the body's tissues are exposed to high levels of cortisol for too long. Many people develop Cushing's syndrome because they take glucocorticoids-steroid hormones that are chemically similar to naturally produced cortisolsuch as prednisone for asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and other inflammatory diseases. Glucocorticoids are also used to suppress the immune system after transplantation to keep the body from rejecting the new organ or tissue.\n                \nOther people develop Cushing's syndrome because their bodies produce too much cortisol. Normally, the production of cortisol follows a precise chain of events. First, the hypothalamus, a part of the brain about the size of a small sugar cube, sends corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) to the pituitary gland. CRH causes the pituitary to secrete adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH), which stimulates the adrenal glands. When the adrenals, which are located just above the kidneys, receive the ACTH, they respond by releasing cortisol into the bloodstream.\n                \nCortisol performs vital tasks in the body including\n                \n- helping maintain blood pressure and cardiovascular function  - reducing the immune system's inflammatory response  - balancing the effects of insulin, which breaks down glucose for energy  - regulating the metabolism of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats\n                \nOne of cortisol's most important jobs is to help the body respond to stress. For this reason, women in their last 3 months of pregnancy and highly trained athletes normally have high levels of the hormone. People suffering from depression, alcoholism, malnutrition, or panic disorders also have increased cortisol levels.\n                \nWhen the amount of cortisol in the blood is adequate, the hypothalamus and pituitary release less CRH and ACTH. This process ensures the amount of cortisol released by the adrenal glands is precisely balanced to meet the bodys daily needs. However, if something goes wrong with the adrenals or the regulating switches in the pituitary gland or hypothalamus, cortisol production can go awry.\n                \nPituitary Adenomas\n                \nPituitary adenomas cause 70 percent of Cushing's syndrome cases,1 excluding those caused by glucocorticoid use. These benign, or noncancerous, tumors of the pituitary gland secrete extra ACTH. Most people with the disorder have a single adenoma. This form of the syndrome, known as Cushing's disease, affects women five times more often than men.\n                \nEctopic ACTH Syndrome\n                \nSome benign or, more often, cancerous tumors that arise outside the pituitary can produce ACTH. This condition is known as ectopic ACTH syndrome. Lung tumors cause more than half of these cases, and men are affected three times more often than women. The most common forms of ACTH-producing tumors are small cell lung cancer, which accounts for about 13 percent of all lung cancer cases,2 and carcinoid tumors-small, slow-growing tumors that arise from hormone-producing cells in various parts of the body. Other less common types of tumors that can produce ACTH are thymomas, pancreatic islet cell tumors, and medullary carcinomas of the thyroid.\n                \nAdrenal Tumors\n                \nIn rare cases, an abnormality of the adrenal glands, most often an adrenal tumor, causes Cushing's syndrome. Adrenal tumors are four to five times more common in women than men, and the average age of onset is about 40. Most of these cases involve noncancerous tumors of adrenal tissue called adrenal adenomas, which release excess cortisol into the blood.\n                \nAdrenocortical carcinomas-adrenal cancers-are the least common cause of Cushing's syndrome. With adrenocortical carcinomas, cancer cells secrete excess levels of several adrenocortical hormones, including cortisol and adrenal androgens, a type of male hormone. Adrenocortical carcinomas usually cause very high hormone levels and rapid development of symptoms.\n                \nFamilial Cushing's Syndrome\n                \nMost cases of Cushing's syndrome are not inherited. Rarely, however, Cushing's syndrome results from an...\n\n    Generated Answer:...\n\n    Scoring guide:\n    1. Scientific Consensus: 1=Aligned, 0=No consensus, -1=Opposed\n    2.

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: How to diagnose Cushing's Syndrome?\n\n    Reference Answer: Diagnosis is based on a review of a person's medical history, a physical examination, and laboratory tests. X rays of the adrenal or pituitary glands can be useful in locating tumors.\n                \nTests to Diagnose Cushing's Syndrome\n                \nNo single lab test is perfect and usually several are needed. The three most common tests used to diagnose Cushing's syndrome are the 24-hour urinary free cortisol test, measurement of midnight plasma cortisol or late-night salivary cortisol, and the low-dose dexamethasone suppression test. Another test, the dexamethasone-corticotropin-releasing hormone test, may be needed to distinguish Cushing's syndrome from other causes of excess cortisol.\n                \n- 24-hour urinary free cortisol level. In this test, a person's urine is collected several times over a 24-hour period and tested for cortisol. Levels higher than 50 to 100 micrograms a day for an adult suggest Cushing's syndrome. The normal upper limit varies in different laboratories, depending on which measurement technique is used.  - Midnight plasma cortisol and late-night salivary cortisol measurements. The midnight plasma cortisol test measures cortisol concentrations in the blood. Cortisol production is normally suppressed at night, but in Cushing's syndrome, this suppression doesn't occur. If the cortisol level is more than 50 nanomoles per liter (nmol/L), Cushing's syndrome is suspected. The test generally requires a 48-hour hospital stay to avoid falsely elevated cortisol levels due to stress.   However, a late-night or bedtime saliva sample can be obtained at home, then tested to determine the cortisol level. Diagnostic ranges vary, depending on the measurement technique used.  - Low-dose dexamethasone suppression test (LDDST). In the LDDST, a person is given a low dose of dexamethasone, a synthetic glucocorticoid, by mouth every 6 hours for 2 days. Urine is collected before dexamethasone is administered and several times on each day of the test. A modified LDDST uses a onetime overnight dose.  Cortisol and other glucocorticoids signal the pituitary to release less ACTH, so the normal response after taking dexamethasone is a drop in blood and urine cortisol levels. If cortisol levels do not drop, Cushing's syndrome is suspected. The LDDST may not show a drop in cortisol levels in people with depression, alcoholism, high estrogen levels, acute illness, or stress, falsely indicating Cushing's syndrome. On the other hand, drugs such as phenytoin and phenobarbital may cause cortisol levels to drop, falsely indicating that Cushings is not present in people who actually have the syndrome. For this reason, physicians usually advise their patients to stop taking these drugs at least 1 week before the test.  - Dexamethasone-corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) test. Some people have high cortisol levels but do not develop the progressive effects of Cushing's syndrome, such as muscle weakness, fractures, and thinning of the skin. These people may have pseudo-Cushing's syndrome, a condition sometimes found in people who have depression or anxiety disorders, drink excess alcohol, have poorly controlled diabetes, or are severely obese. Pseudo-Cushings does not have the same long-term effects on health as Cushing's syndrome and does not require treatment directed at the endocrine glands.  The dexamethasone-CRH test rapidly distinguishes pseudo-Cushing's from mild cases of Cushing's. This test combines the LDDST and a CRH stimulation test. In the CRH stimulation test, an injection of CRH causes the pituitary to secrete ACTH. Pretreatment with dexamethasone prevents CRH from causing an increase in cortisol in people with pseudo-Cushing's. Elevations of cortisol during this test suggest Cushing's syndrome.\n                \nTests to Find the Cause of Cushing's Syndrome\n                \nOnce Cushing's syndrome has been diagnosed, other tests are used to find the exact location of the abnormality that leads to excess cortisol production. The choice of test depends, in part, on the preference of the endocrinologist or the center where the test is performed.\n                \n- CRH stimulation test. The CRH test, without pretreatment with dexamethasone, helps separate people with pituitary adenomas from those with ectopic ACTH syndrome or adrenal tumors. As a result of the CRH injection, people with pituitary adenomas usually experience a rise in blood levels of ACTH and cortisol because CRH acts directly on the pituitary. This response is rarely seen in people with ectopic ACTH syndrome and practically never in those with adrenal tumors.  - high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. High doses of dexamethasone suppress ACTH secretion in people with pituitary adenomas but not in those whose Cushing's syndrome is due to either ectopic ACTH-producing tumors or adrenal tumors.  - Imaging tests. One or more imaging procedures are used to locate the source of the excess cortisol production. The preferred method is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pituitary gland, which can detect all but the smallest pituitary adenomas. Abdominal CT scans are used to image the adrenal glands because they can detect all but the smallest adrenal tumors. Chest x-rays and CT scans are used to detect tumors in the chest, such as bronchogenic carcinomas. Sometimes, sampling of blood from various veins in the body is done to help locate the source of ACTH overproduction.\n                \nTreatment\n                \nThe goal of treatment is to restore normal cortisol production. The choice of treatment depends on the specific reason for the excess cortisol and the overall health of the patient. Surgery is usually the first line of treatment for Cushing's disease. Removing the tumor will correct the hormonal imbalance. Patients should work closely with their healthcare provider to manage symptoms of the disease until surgery can be performed. Medication can help control the symptoms of Cushing's syndrome. A medication called metyrapone (Metopirone) can decrease cortisol production. Other medications can reduce inflammation caused by excess cortisol. Radiation therapy may also be used, especially if surgical removal of the tumor is not possible. If these treatments are not effective, medications that block the production of cortisol at the adrenal gland level may be prescribed. Chemotherapy may be used to shrink any residual tumor cells remaining after surgery. In some cases, it may be necessary to remove both adrenal glands. In these cases, the patient must take replacement hormones for the rest of his or her life.\n                \nPrognosis\n                \nIf left untreated, Cushing's syndrome can lead to serious complications, such as osteoporosis, bone fractures, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, stroke, and opportunistic infections. Women may experience hirsutism, irregular menstrual cycles, and infertility. Cognitive difficulties, including decreased concentration and memory, and psychiatric problems, such as depression and anxiety, may also occur. Early diagnosis and treatment of Cushing's syndrome can reverse signs and symptoms of the disease and give affected individuals a good quality of life.\n                \nPrevention\n                \nThere is no known prevention for Cushing's syndrome. However, early detection and treatment can prevent complications associated with the",

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: What are the treatments for Cushing's Syndrome?\n\n    Reference Answer: Treatment depends on the specific reason for excess cortisol and may include surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, or the use of cortisol-inhibiting drugs. If the cause is long-term use of glucocorticoid hormones to treat another disorder, the doctor will gradually reduce the dosage to the lowest dose adequate for control of that disorder. Once control is established, the daily dose of glucocorticoid hormones may be doubled and given on alternate days to lessen side effects. In some cases, noncorticosteroid drugs can be prescribed.\n                \nPituitary Adenomas\n                \nSeveral therapies are available to treat the ACTH-secreting pituitary adenomas of Cushing's disease. The most widely used treatment is surgical removal of the tumor, known as transsphenoidal adenomectomy. Using a special microscope and fine instruments, the surgeon approaches the pituitary gland through a nostril or an opening made below the upper lip. Because this procedure is extremely delicate, patients are often referred to centers specializing in this type of surgery. The success, or cure, rate of this procedure is more than 80 percent when performed by a surgeon with extensive experience. If surgery fails or only produces a temporary cure, surgery can be repeated, often with good results.\n                \nAfter curative pituitary surgery, the production of ACTH drops two levels below normal. This drop is natural and temporary, and patients are given a synthetic form of cortisol such as hydrocortisone or prednisone to compensate. Most people can stop this replacement therapy in less than 1 or 2 years, but some must be on it for life.\n                \nIf transsphenoidal surgery fails or a patient is not a suitable candidate for surgery, radiation therapy is another possible treatment. Radiation to the pituitary gland is given over a 6-week period, with improvement occurring in 40 to 50 percent of adults and up to 85 percent of children. Another technique, called stereotactic radiosurgery or gamma knife radiation, can be given in a single high-dose treatment. It may take several months or years before people feel better from radiation treatment alone. Combining radiation with cortisol-inhibiting drugs can help speed recovery.\n                \nDrugs used alone or in combination to control the production of excess cortisol are ketoconazole, mitotane, aminoglutethimide, and metyrapone. Each drug has its own side effects that doctors consider when prescribing medical therapy for individual patients.\n                \nEctopic ACTH Syndrome\n                \nTo cure the overproduction of cortisol caused by ectopic ACTH syndrome, all of the cancerous tissue that is secreting ACTH must be eliminated. The choice of cancer treatment-surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or a combination of these treatmentsdepends on the type of cancer and how far it has spread. Because ACTH-secreting tumors may be small or widespread at the time of diagnosis, making them difficult to locate and treat directly, cortisol-inhibiting drugs are an important part of treatment.

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: How to diagnose Hematuria (Blood in the Urine)?\n\n    Reference Answer: Hematuria is diagnosed with urinalysis, which is testing of a urine sample. The urine sample is collected in a special container in a health care providers office or commercial facility and can be tested in the same location or sent to a lab for analysis. For the test, a nurse or technician places a strip of chemically treated paper, called a dipstick, into the urine. Patches on the dipstick change color when RBCs are present in urine. When blood is visible in the urine or a dipstick test of the urine indicates the presence of RBCs, a health care provider examines the urine with a microscope to make an initial diagnosis of hematuria. The next step is to diagnose the cause of the hematuria.\n                \nThe health care provider will take a thorough medical history. If the history suggests a cause that does not require treatment, the urine should be tested again after 48 hours for the presence of RBCs. If two of three urine samples show too many RBCs when viewed with a microscope, more serious causes should be explored. The health care provider may order one or more of the following tests:\n                \n- Urinalysis. Further testing of the urine may be done to check for problems that can cause hematuria, such as infection, kidney disease, and cancer. The presence of white blood cells signals a UTI. RBCs that are misshapen or clumped together to form little tubes, called casts, may indicate kidney disease. Large amounts of protein in the urine, called proteinuria, may also indicate kidney disease. The urine can also be tested for the presence of cancer cells.  - Blood test. A blood test involves drawing blood at a health care providers office or commercial facility and sending the sample to a lab for analysis. A blood test can show the presence of high levels of creatinine, a waste product of normal muscle breakdown, which may indicate kidney disease.  - Biopsy. A biopsy is a procedure that involves taking a piece of kidney tissue for examination with a microscope. The biopsyis performed by a health care provider in a hospital with light sedation and local anesthetic. The health care provider uses imaging techniques such as ultrasound or a computerized tomography (CT) scan to guide the biopsy needle into the kidney. The kidney tissue is examined in a lab by a pathologista doctor who specializes in diagnosing diseases. The test helps diagnose the type of kidney disease causing hematuria.  - Cystoscopy. Cystoscopy is a procedure that uses a tubelike instrument to look inside the urethra and bladder. Cystoscopy is performed by a health care provider in the office, an outpatient facility, or a hospital with local anesthesia. However, in some cases, sedation and regional or general anesthesia are needed. Cystoscopy may be used to look for cancer cells in the bladder, particularly if cancer cells are found with urinalysis. More information is provided in the NIDDK health topic,Cystoscopy and Ureteroscopy.   - Kidney imaging tests. Intravenous pyelogram (IVP) is an x ray of the urinary tract. A special dye, called contrast medium, is injected into a vein in the persons arm, travels through the body to the kidneys, and makes urine visible on the x ray. The contrast medium also shows any blockage in the urinary tract. When a small mass is found with IVP, another imaging test, such as an ultrasound, CT scan, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), can be used to further study...\n\n    Generated Answer: Hematuria, or blood in the urine, can be diagnosed through the following steps:\n\n1. Medical history: The doctor will ask about any symptoms, medical conditions, family history, and medication use.\n2. Physical examination: A general physical exam may reveal signs of underlying conditions that can cause hematuria.\n3. Urinalysis: A urine sample will be tested for red blood cells, white blood cells, and other substances that can indicate the presence of infection, kidney stones, or other issues.\n4. Imaging tests: Depending on the results of the urinalysis, the doctor may order imaging tests such as ultrasound, CT scan, or MRI...\n\n    Scoring guide:\n    1.

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: How to diagnose Urinary Incontinence in Men?\n\n    Reference Answer: Men should tell a health care professional, such as a family practice physician, a nurse, an internist, or a urologista doctor who specializes in urinary problemsthey have UI, even if they feel embarrassed. To diagnose UI, the health care professional will\n                \n- take a medical history  - conduct a physical exam  - order diagnostic tests\n                \nMedical History\n                \nTaking a medical history can help a health care professional diagnose UI. He or she will ask the patient or caretaker to provide a medical history, a review of symptoms, a description of eating habits, and a list of prescription and over-the-counter medications the patient is taking. The health care professional will ask about current and past medical conditions.\n                \nThe health care professional also will ask about the mans pattern of urination and urine leakage. To prepare for the visit with the health care professional, a man may want to keep a bladder diary for several days beforehand. Information that a man should record in a bladder diary includes\n                \n- the amount and type of liquid he drinks  - how many times he urinates each day and how much urine is released  - how often he has accidental leaks  - whether he felt a strong urge to go before leaking  - what he was doing when the leak occurred, for example, coughing or lifting  - how long the symptoms have been occurring\n                \nUse the Daily Bladder Diary to prepare for the appointment.\n                \nThe health care professional also may ask about other lower urinary tract symptoms that may indicate a prostate problem, such as\n                \n- problems starting a urine stream  - problems emptying the bladder completely  - spraying urine  - dribbling urine  - weak stream  - recurrent UTIs  - painful urination\n                \nPhysical Exam\n                \nA physical exam may help diagnose UI. The health care professional will perform a physical exam to look for signs of medical conditions that may cause UI. The health care professional may order further neurologic testing if necessary.\n                \nDigital rectal exam. The health care professional also may perform a digital rectal exam. A digital rectal exam is a physical exam of the prostate and rectum. To perform the exam, the health care professional has the man bend over a table or lie on his side while holding his knees close to his chest. The health care professional slides a gloved, lubricated finger into the patients rectum and feels the part of the prostate that lies in front of the rectum. The digital rectal exam is used to check for stool or masses in the rectum and to assess whether the prostate is enlarged or tender, or has other abnormalities. The health care professional may perform a prostate massage during a digital rectal exam to collect a sample of prostate fluid that he or she can test for signs of infection.\n                \nThe health care professional may diagnose the type of UI based on the medical history and physical exam, or he or she may use the findings to determine if a man needs further diagnostic testing.\n                \nDiagnostic Tests\n                \nThe health care professional may order one or more of the following diagnostic tests based on the results of the medical history and physical exam:\n                \n- Urinalysis. Urinalysis involves testing a urine sample. The patient collects a urine sample in a special container at home, at a health care professionals office, or at a commercial facility. A health care professional tests the sample during an office visit or sends it to a lab for analysis. For the test, a nurse or technician places a strip of chemically treated paper, called a dipstick, into the urine. Patches on the dipstick change color to indicate signs of infection in urine.  - Urine culture. A health care professional performs a urine culture by placing part of a urine sample in a tube or dish with a substance that encourages any bacteria present to grow. A man collects the urine sample in a special container in a health care professionals office or a commercial facility. The office or facility tests the sample onsite or sends it to a lab for culture. A health care professional can identify bacteria that multiply, usually in 1 to 3 days. A health care professional performs a urine culture to determine the best treatment when urinalysis indicates the man has a UTI. More information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Urinary Tract Infections in Adults.  - Blood test. A blood test involves drawing blood at a health care professionals office or a commercial facility and sending the sample to a lab for analysis. The blood test can show kidney function problems or a chemical imbalance in the body. The lab also will test the blood to assess the level of prostate-specific antigen, a protein produced by prostate cells that may be higher in men with prostate cancer.  - Urodynamic testing. Urodynamic testing includes a variety of procedures that look at how well the bladder and urethra store and release urine. A health care professional performs urodynamic tests during an office visit or at an outpatient center. Most urodynamic tests focus on the bladder muscle and urethral sphincters. Some common urodynamic tests include\n- Uroflowmetry. This test measures the rate of urine flow. An abnormal rate may indicate obstruction of the urethra or weakness of bladder muscles.  - Postvoid residual measurements. This test measures the amount of remaining urine after urinating. Results can indicate blockage of the urethra or weakness of bladder muscles.  - Cystometry. This test measures pressure inside the bladder to see how well the bladder muscle holds urine.  - Electromyography. This test records the electrical activity of the muscles and nerves controlling the bladder and urethra.  - Video urodynamics. This test uses x-ray imaging to create videos of the bladder filling and emptying. The test can show abnormal movement of urine through the urethra and bladder.  - Ultrasound imaging. This test uses sound waves to create images of the kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra. The test can show abnormalities in the shape of these organs and help the health care professional determine the nature of the UI.  - Pelvic floor electromyography. This test records the electrical activity of the muscles in the pelvic floor, including those that control the bladder and urethra.  - Voiding diary. A voiding diary is a tool used to track urination patterns. A man keeps a voiding diary for several days before visiting a health care professional. The diary helps the health care professional understand the mans urination patterns, which can help diagnose UI. The diary tracks the time of day, the volume of urine, and the circumstances surrounding urination. The health care professional may use the information from the voiding diary to recommend lifestyle changes or treatments.\n                \nThe health care professional may use the results of the diagnostic tests to confirm the diagnosis of UI and develop a treatment plan.",

            "raw_response": "Evaluate this medical answer based on the criteria below. Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: What are the treatments for Urinary Incontinence in Men?\n\n    Reference Answer: Treatment depends on the type of UI.\n                \nUrgency Incontinence\n                \nAs a first line of therapy for urgency incontinence, a health care professional may recommend the following techniques to treat a mans problem:\n                \n- behavioral and lifestyle changes  - bladder training  - pelvic floor exercises  - urgency suppression\n                \nIf those treatments are not successful, the following additional measures may help urgency incontinence:\n                \n- medications  - electrical nerve stimulation  - bulking agents  - surgery\n                \nA health care professional may recommend other treatments for men with urgency incontinence caused by BPH. More information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Prostate Enlargement: Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia.\n                \nBehavioral and lifestyle changes. Men with urgency incontinence may be able to reduce leaks by making behavioral and lifestyle changes:\n                \n- Eating, diet, and nutrition. Men with urgency incontinence can change the amount and type of liquid they drink. A man can try limiting bladder irritantsincluding caffeinated drinks such as tea or coffee and carbonated beveragesto decrease leaks. Men also should limit alcoholic drinks, which can increase urine production. A health care professional can help a man determine how much he should drink based on his health, how active he is, and where he lives. To decrease nighttime trips to the restroom, men may want to stop drinking liquids several hours before bed.  - Engaging in physical activity. Although a man may be reluctant to engage in physical activity when he has urgency incontinence, regular exercise is important for good overall health and for preventing and treating UI.  - Losing weight. Men who are overweight should talk with a health care professional about strategies for losing weight, which can help improve UI.  - Preventing constipation. Gastrointestinal (GI) problems, especially constipation, can make urinary tract health worse and can lead to UI. The opposite is also true: Urinary problems, such as UI, can make GI problems worse. More information about how to prevent constipation through diet and physical activity is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Constipation.\n                \n\n                \nTo Help Prevent Bladder Problems, Stop Smoking   People who smoke should stop. Quitting smoking at any age promotes bladder health and overall health. Smoking increases a persons chance of developing stress incontinence, as it increases coughing. Some people say smoking worsens their bladder irritation. Smoking causes most cases of bladder cancer. People who smoke for many years have a higher risk of bladder cancer than nonsmokers or those who smoke for a short time.2 People who smoke should ask for help so they do not have to try quitting alone. Call 1-800-QUITNOW (1-800-784-8669) for more information.\n                \nBladder training. Bladder training is changing urination habits to decrease incidents of UI. The health care professional may suggest a man use the restroom at regular timed intervals, called timed voiding, based on the mans bladder diary. A man can gradually lengthen the time between trips to the restroom to help stretch the bladder so it can hold more urine.\n                \nPelvic floor muscle exercises. Pelvic floor muscle, or Kegel, exercises involve strengthening pelvic floor muscles. Strong pelvic floor muscles hold in urine more effectively than weak muscles. A man does not need special equipment for Kegel exercises. The exercises involve tightening and relaxing the muscles that control urine flow. Pelvic floor exercises should not be performed during urination. A health care professional can help a man learn proper technique. More information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Kegel Exercise Tips.\n                \nMen also may learn how to perform Kegel exercises properly by using biofeedback. Biofeedback uses special sensors to measure bodily functions, such as muscle contractions that control urination. A video monitor displays the measurements as graphs, and sounds indicate when the man is using the correct muscles. The health care professional uses the information to help the man change abnormal function of the pelvic floor muscles. At home, the man practices to improve muscle function. The man can perform the exercises while lying down, sitting at a desk, or standing up. Success with pelvic floor exercises depends on the cause of UI, its severity, and the mans ability to perform the exercises.\n                \nUrgency suppression. By using certain techniques, a man can suppress the urge to urinate, called urgency suppression. Urgency suppression is a way for a man to train his bladder to maintain control so he does not have to panic about finding a restroom. Some men use distraction techniques to take their mind off the urge to urinate. Other men find taking long, relaxing breaths and being still can help. Doing pelvic floor exercises also can help suppress the urge to urinate.\n                \nMedications. Health care professionals may prescribe medications that relax the bladder, decrease bladder spasms, and improve urine flow. Medications used to treat UI include anticholinergicsantimuscarinics, mirabegron, and alpha-blockers. Anticholinergicantimuscarinic drugs work by blocking the action of acetylcholine, a chemical messenger that signals the bladder muscle to contract. Mirabegron works by helping the bladder muscle relax during filling. Alpha-blockers relax the smooth muscle of the prostate and bladder neck, making it easier to empty the bladder. More information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, How are Medicines Used to Treat Overactive Bladder?\n                \nElectrical nerve stimulation. Electrical nerve stimulation involves delivering low-voltage electric current to nerves in the lower back or around the rectum to stimulate the bladder and surrounding muscles. This treatment can strengthen the muscles and improve bladder control. There are two approaches to electrical nerve stimulation:\n                \npercutaneous tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS)\n                \nsacral neuromodulation\n                \nPercutaneous tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS). PTNS is an office procedure that takes about 30 minutes per session. A small device delivers low-voltage electric current to a nerve near the ankle. The patient will feel a sensation in the foot, but no pain. Twelve sessions are usually needed, one per week. After the initial series of 12 sessions, some patients may require maintenance treatments every 4 weeks to keep symptoms under control. The procedure is done in a doctors office.\n                \nSacral neuromodulation. Sacral neuromodulation involves implanting a device under the skin that sends electrical impulses to the sacral nerves. The sacral nerves control the bladder and muscles related to urination. The device is implanted during outpatient surgery. Once the device is placed, the man can turn it on or off. The device requires periodic adjustments, which can be made during follow-up visits to the doctor. The procedure is typically covered by insurance.\n                \nBulking agents. Bulking agents are injected into tissue surrounding the urethra to narrow the urethra so the man can retain urine better. Bulkling agents include collagen and synthetic materials. Collagen is a natural protein that provides structure to skin, bones, and connective tissue. Synthetic materials mimic the bodys natural tissues. The body eventually absorbs these materials over time, so repeat injections are necessary periodically. The procedure is typically done in a doctors office.\n                \nSurgery. Surgery is generally considered only after other treatments have failed.",

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: What are the treatments for Nerve Disease and Bladder Control?\n\n    Reference Answer: The treatment for a bladder control problem depends on the cause of the nerve damage and the type of voiding dysfunction that results.\n                \nIn the case of overactive bladder, your doctor may suggest a number of strategies, including bladder training, electrical stimulation, drug therapy, and, in severe cases where all other treatments have failed, surgery.\n                \nBladder training. Your doctor may ask you to keep a bladder diary-a record of your fluid intake, trips to the bathroom, and episodes of urine leakage. This record may indicate a pattern and suggest ways to avoid accidents by making a point of using the bathroom at certain times of the day-a practice called timed voiding. As you gain control, you can extend the time between trips to the bathroom. Bladder training also includes Kegel exercises to strengthen the muscles that hold in urine.\n                \nElectrical stimulation. Mild electrical pulses can be used to stimulate the nerves that control the bladder and sphincter muscles. Depending on which nerves the doctor plans to treat, these pulses can be given through the vagina or anus, or by using patches on the skin. Another method is a minor surgical procedure to place the electric wire near the tailbone. This procedure involves two steps. First, the wire is placed under the skin and connected to a temporary stimulator, which you carry with you for several days. If your condition improves during this trial period, then the wire is placed next to the tailbone and attached to a permanent stimulator under your skin. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved this device, marketed as the InterStim system, to treat urge incontinence, urgency-frequency syndrome, and urinary retention in patients for whom other treatments have not worked.\n                \nDrug therapy. Different drugs can affect the nerves and muscles of the urinary tract in different ways.\n                \n-  Drugs that relax bladder muscles and prevent bladder spasms include oxybutynin chloride (Ditropan), tolterodine (Detrol), hyoscyamine (Levsin), and propantheline bromide (Pro-Banthine), which belong to the class of drugs called anticholinergics. Their most common side effect is dry mouth, although large doses may cause blurred vision, constipation, a faster heartbeat, and flushing. A new patch delivery system for oxybutynin (Oxytrol) may decrease side effects. Ditropan XL and Detrol LA are timed-release formulations that deliver a low level of the drug continuously in the body. These drugs have the advantage of once-a-day administration. In 2004, the FDA approved trospium chloride (Sanctura), darifenacin (Enablex), and solifenacin succinate (VESIcare) for the treatment of overactive bladder.  -  Drugs for depression that also relax bladder muscles include imipramine hydrochloride (Tofranil), a tricyclic antidepressant. Side effects may include fatigue, dry mouth, dizziness, blurred vision, nausea, and insomnia.\n                \nAdditional drugs are being evaluated for the treatment of overactive bladder and may soon receive FDA approval.\n                \nSurgery. In extreme cases, when incontinence is severe and other treatments have failed, surgery...\n\n    Generated Answer: Nerve damage that affects bladder control can be treated in several ways, depending on the underlying cause. Here are some common treatments:\n\n1. Medications: Certain medications can help improve bladder function and reduce symptoms. These may include anticholinergics, mirabegron, or botulinum toxin A injections.\n2. Physical therapy: Pelvic floor physical therapy can help improve bladder control by strengthening the muscles that support the bladder.\n3. Bladder training: This involves learning to hold urine for longer periods of time to gradually increase the bladder's capacity and reduce the frequency of urination.\n4. Electrical stimulation: This therapy involves using gentle electrical pulses to stimulate the nerves that control the...\n\n    Scoring guide:\n    1.

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: What are the complications of Polycystic Kidney Disease?\n\n    Reference Answer: The complications of autosomal dominant PKD include the following:\n                \n- Pain. Cyst infection, other types of urinary tract infections (UTIs), bleeding into cysts, kidney stones, or stretching of the fibrous tissue around the kidney because of cyst growth can cause pain in the area of the kidneys.  - High blood pressure. High blood pressure is present in about half of the people with autosomal dominant PKD and normal kidney function between the ages of 20 and 35.4 Almost 100 percent of people with kidney failure and autosomal dominant PKD have high blood pressure.1 High blood pressuregreater than 140/90 mm Hgincreases the likelihood of heart disease and stroke, as well as adding to the damage already done to the kidneys by the cysts.  - Kidney failure. Kidney failure means the kidneys no longer work well enough to maintain health. A person with kidney failure may have the following symptoms:      - little or no urination    - edemaswelling, usually in the legs, feet, or ankles and less often in the hands or face    - drowsiness    - fatigue, or feeling tired    - generalized itching or numbness    - dry skin    - headaches    - weight loss    - appetite loss    - nausea    - vomiting    - sleep problems    - trouble concentrating    - darkened skin    - muscle cramps    - shortness of breath    - chest pain\n                \nUntreated kidney failure can lead to coma and death. More than half of people with autosomal dominant PKD progress to kidney failure by age 70.1\n                \n- UTIs. Kidney cysts block the flow of urine through the kidneys. Stagnant urine can set the stage for infection. Bacteria enter the urinary tract through the urethra and spread up to the kidneys. Sometimes, the kidney cysts become infected. UTIs may cause scarring in the kidneys.  - Kidney stones. About 20 percent of people with autosomal dominant PKD have kidney stones.1 Kidney stones can block the flow of urine and cause pain.  - Liver cysts. Liver cysts are the most common nonkidney complication of autosomal dominant PKD.1 Liver cysts generally cause no symptoms.  - Pancreatic cysts. PKD can also cause cysts in the pancreas. Pancreatic cysts rarely cause pancreatitisinflammation, or swelling, of the pancreas.  - Abnormal heart valves. Abnormal heart valves may occur in up to 25 percent of people with autosomal dominant PKD.1 Insufficient blood flow in the aortathe large artery that carries blood from the heartmay result from the abnormal heart valves.  - Diverticula. Diverticula are small pouches, or sacs,...\n\n    Generated Answer: Polycystic Kidney Disease (PKD) is a genetic disorder characterized by the growth of numerous cysts in the kidneys. Here are some potential complications of PKD:\n\n1. Kidney failure: PKD can cause cysts to grow so large that they eventually impair kidney function, leading to kidney failure.\n2. High blood pressure: The growth of cysts in PKD can lead to the narrowing of blood vessels in the kidneys, causing high blood pressure.\n3. Chronic pain: The growth of cysts in PKD can cause chronic pain in the back or sides.\n4. Urinary tract or kidney infections: The presence of cysts in PKD can increase the risk of developing urinary tract or kidney infections.\n5. Kidney stones: The growth of cysts in PKD can increase the risk of developing kidney...\n\n    Scoring guide:\n    1. Scientific Consensus: 1=Aligned, 0=No consensus, -1=Opposed\n    2.

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: What to do for Polycystic Kidney Disease?\n\n    Reference Answer: A dietitian specializes in helping people who have kidney disease choose the right foods and plan healthy meals. People with any kind of kidney disease, including PKD, should talk with a dietitian about foods that should be added to their diet and foods that might be harmful.\n                \nPKD may require diet changes for blood pressure control. Kidney disease in general also calls for certain diet changes.\n                \nFollowing a healthy eating plan can help lower blood pressure. A health care provider may recommend the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating plan, which focuses on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and other foods that are heart healthy and lower in sodium, which often comes from salt. The DASH eating plan\n                \n- is low in fat and cholesterol  - features fat-free or low-fat milk and dairy products, fish, poultry, and nuts  - suggests less red meat, sweets, added sugars, and sugar-containing beverages  - is rich in nutrients, protein, and fiber\n                \nMore information about the DASH eating planis available from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute.\n                \nAs your kidneys become more damaged, you may need to eat foods that are lower in phosphorus and potassium. The health care provider will use lab tests to watch your levels.\n                \nFoods high in potassium include\n                \n- bananas  - oranges  - potatoes  - tomatoes\n                \nLower-potassium foods include\n                \n- apples  - peaches  - carrots  - green beans\n                \nFoods higher in phosphorus include\n                \n- large portions of meat, fish and dairy foods  - bran cereals and oatmeal  - beans and nuts  - colas\n                \nLower-phosphorus alternatives include\n                \n- fresh fruits and vegetables  - breads  - pasta  - rice  - corn and rice cereals  - light-colored sodas\n                \nPeople with kidney disease and high blood pressure should also limit how much sodium they get to 2,300 mg or less each day.5\n                \nPeople with CKD may need to watch how much protein they eat. Everyone needs protein. However, protein breaks down into wastes the kidneys must remove. Large amounts of protein make the kidneys work harder. High-quality proteins such as meat, fish, and eggs create fewer wastes than other sources of protein. Beans, whole grains, soy products, nuts and nut butters, and dairy products can also be good sources of protein. Most people eat more protein than they need. Eating high-quality protein and smaller...\n\n    Generated Answer: I understand that you're looking for information on Polycystic Kidney Disease (PKD). Here's a brief, helpful response:\n\n1. Monitor and manage symptoms: Work with your doctor to monitor blood pressure, kidney function, and any pain or discomfort.\n2.

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: How to diagnose Kidney Stones in Children?\n\n    Reference Answer: The process of diagnosing any illness begins with consideration of the symptoms. Pain or bloody urine may be the first symptom. Urine, blood, and imaging tests will help determine whether symptoms are caused by a stone. Urine tests can be used to check for infection and for substances that form stones. Blood tests can be used to check for biochemical problems that can lead to kidney stones. Various imaging techniques can be used to locate the stone:\n                \n- Ultrasound uses a device, called a transducer, that bounces safe, painless sound waves off organs to create an image of their structure. An abdominal ultrasound can create images of the entire urinary tract. The procedure is performed in a health care providers office, outpatient center, or hospital by a specially trained technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologista doctor who specializes in medical imaging; anesthesia is not needed. The images can show the location of any stones. This test does not expose children to radiation, unlike some other imaging tests. Although other tests are more useful in detecting very small stones or stones in the lower portion of the ureter, ultrasound is considered by many health care providers to be the best screening test to look for stones.  - Computerized tomography (CT) scans use a combination of x rays and computer technology to create threedimensional (3-D) images. A CT scan may include the injection of a special dye, called contrast medium. CT scans require the child to lie on a table that slides into a tunnel-shaped device where the x rays are taken. The procedure is performed in an outpatient center or hospital by an x-ray technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologist; anesthesia is not needed. CT scans may be required to get an accurate stone count when children are being considered for urologic surgery. Because CT scans expose children to a moderate amount of radiation, health care providers try to reduce radiation exposure in children by avoiding repeated CT scans, restricting the area scanned as much as possible, and using the lowest radiation dose that will provide the...\n\n    Generated Answer: Diagnosing kidney stones in children typically involves the following steps:\n\n1. Medical history: The doctor will ask about the child's symptoms, such as pain, nausea, vomiting, and blood in the urine.\n2. Physical examination: The doctor will perform a physical exam to check for tenderness in the abdomen or flank, which can indicate the presence of a kidney stone.\n3. Imaging tests: The doctor may order imaging tests, such as a non-contrast helical computed tomography (CT) scan, ultrasound, or X-ray, to visualize the stone and determine its size and location.\n4.

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: What causes Urinary Incontinence in Children?\n\n    Reference Answer: The exact cause of most cases of nighttime UI is not known. Though a few cases are caused by structural problems in the urinary tract, most cases probably result from a mix of factors including slower physical development, an overproduction of urine at night, and the inability to recognize bladder filling when asleep. Nighttime UI has also been associated with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), OSA, and anxiety. Children also may inherit genes from one or both parents that make them more likely to have nighttime UI.\n                \nSlower Physical Development\n                \nBetween the ages of 5 and 10, bedwetting may be the result of a small bladder capacity, long sleeping periods, and underdevelopment of the bodys alarms that signal a full or emptying bladder. This form of UI fades away as the bladder grows and the natural alarms become operational.\n                \nOverproduction of Urine at Night\n                \nThe body produces antidiuretic hormone (ADH), a natural chemical that slows down the production of urine. More ADH is produced at night so the need to urinate lessens. If the body does not produce enough ADH at night, the production of urine may not slow down, leading to bladder overfilling. If a child does not sense the bladder filling and awaken to urinate, wetting will occur.\n                \nStructural Problems\n                \nA small number of UI cases are caused by physical problems in the urinary tract. Rarely, a blocked bladder or urethra may cause the bladder to overfill and leak. Nerve damage associated with the birth defect spina bifida can cause UI. In these cases, UI can appear as a constant dribbling of urine.\n                \nAttention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder\n                \nChildren with ADHD are three times more likely to have nighttime UI than children without ADHD.2 The connection between ADHD and bedwetting has not been explained, but some experts theorize that both conditions are related to delays in central nervous system development.\n                \nObstructive Sleep Apnea\n                \nNighttime UI may be one sign of OSA. Other symptoms of OSA include snoring, mouth breathing, frequent ear and sinus infections, sore throat, choking, and daytime drowsiness. Experts believe that when the airway in people with OSA closes, a chemical may be released in the body that increases water production and inhibits the systems that regulate fluid volume. Successful treatment of OSA often resolves the associated nighttime UI.\n                \nAnxiety\n                \nAnxiety-causing events that occur between 2 and 4 years of agebefore total bladder control is achievedmight lead to primary enuresis. Anxiety experienced after age 4 might lead to secondary enuresis in children who have been dry for at least 6 months. Events that cause anxiety in children include physical or sexual abuse; unfamiliar social situations, such as moving or starting at a new school; and major family events such as the...\n\n    Generated Answer: Urinary incontinence in children can be caused by several factors, including:\n\n1.

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: What causes Perineal Injury in Males?\n\n    Reference Answer: Common causes of acute perineal injury in males include\n                \n- perineal surgery  - straddle injuries  - sexual abuse  - impalement\n                \nPerineal Surgery\n                \nAcute perineal injury may result from surgical procedures that require an incision in the perineum:\n                \n- A prostatectomy is the surgical removal of the prostate to treat prostate cancer. The prostate, a walnut-shaped gland in men, surrounds the urethra at the neck of the bladder and supplies fluid that goes into semen. The surgeon chooses the location for the incision based on the patients physical characteristics, such as size and weight, and the surgeons experience and preferences. In one approach, called the radical perineal prostatectomy, the surgeon makes an incision between the scrotum and the anus. In a retropubic prostatectomy, the surgeon makes the incision in the lower abdomen, just above the penis. Both approaches can damage blood vessels and nerves affecting sexual function and bladder control.  - Perineal urethroplasty is surgery to repair stricture, or narrowing, of the portion of the urethra that runs through the perineum. Without this procedure, some men would not be able to pass urine. However, the procedure does require an incision in the perineum, which can damage blood vessels or nerves.  - Colorectal or anal cancer surgery can injure the perineum by cutting through some of the muscle around the anus to remove a tumor. One approach to anal cancer surgery involves making incisions in the abdomen and the perineum.\n                \nSurgeons try to avoid procedures that damage a persons blood vessels, perineal nerves, and muscles. However, sometimes a perineal incision may achieve the best angle to remove a life-threatening cancer.\n                \nPeople should discuss the risks of any planned surgery with their health care provider so they can make an informed decision and understand what to expect after the operation.\n                \nStraddle Injuries\n                \nStraddle injuries result from falls onto objects such as metal bars, pipes, or wooden rails, where the persons legs are on either side of the object and the perineum strikes the object forcefully. These injuries include motorcycle and bike riding accidents, saddle horn injuries during horseback riding, falls on playground equipment such as monkey bars, and gymnastic accidents on an apparatus such as the parallel bars or pommel horse.\n                \nIn rare situations, a blunt injury to the perineum may burst a blood vessel inside the erectile tissue of the penis, causing a persistent partial erection that can last for days to years. This condition is called high-flow priapism. If not treated, ED may result.\n                \nSexual Abuse\n                \nForceful and inappropriate sexual contact can result in perineal injury. When health care providers evaluate injuries in the genital area, they should consider the possibility of sexual abuse, even if the person or family members say the injury is the result of an accident such as a straddle injury. The law requires that health care providers report cases of sexual abuse that come to their attention. The person and family members should understand the health care provider may ask some uncomfortable questions about the circumstances of the injury.\n                \nImpalement\n                \nImpalement injuries may involve metal fence posts, rods, or weapons that...\n\n    Generated Answer: Perineal injury in males can be caused by a variety of factors, including:\n\n1. Trauma: This can be due to accidents, falls, or physical abuse, which can result in cuts, bruises, or fractures in the perineal area.\n2. Straddle injuries: These occur when a male falls on an object that injures the area between the scrotum and the anus.\n3. Surgical procedures: Perineal injury can also occur as...\n\n    Scoring guide:\n    1. Scientific Consensus: 1=Aligned, 0=No consensus, -1=Opposed\n    2.

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: How to diagnose Graves' Disease?\n\n    Reference Answer: Health care providers can sometimes diagnose Graves disease based only on a physical examination and a medical history. Blood tests and other diagnostic tests, such as the following, then confirm the diagnosis.\n                \nTSH test. The ultrasensitive TSH test is usually the first test performed. This test detects even tiny amounts of TSH in the blood and is the most accurate measure of thyroid activity available.\n                \nT3 and T4 test. Another blood test used to diagnose Graves disease measures T3 and T4 levels. In making a diagnosis, health care providers look for below-normal levels of TSH, normal to elevated levels of T4, and elevated levels of T3.\n                \nBecause the combination of low TSH and high T3 and T4 can occur with other thyroid problems, health care providers may order other tests to finalize the diagnosis. The following two tests use small, safe doses of radioactive iodine because the thyroid uses iodine to make thyroid hormone.\n                \nRadioactive iodine uptake test. This test measures the amount of iodine the thyroid collects from the bloodstream. High levels of iodine uptake can indicate Graves disease.\n                \nThyroid scan. This scan shows how and where iodine is distributed in the thyroid. With Graves disease the entire thyroid is involved, so the iodine shows up throughout the gland. Other causes of hyperthyroidism such as nodulessmall lumps in the glandshow a different pattern of iodine distribution.\n...\n\n    Generated Answer: Graves' disease is typically diagnosed through a combination of physical examination, medical history, and diagnostic tests. During the physical examination, the doctor may look for signs such as a goiter (enlarged thyroid gland), eye bulging (exophthalmos), or a rapid heart rate. They may also check for tremors, warm skin, and moist skin.\n\nIn addition to the physical examination, the doctor will also take a medical history to determine if the patient has any symptoms associated with Graves' disease, such as weight loss, anxiety, or fatigue.\n\nDiagnostic tests that may be used to confirm the diagnosis of Graves' disease include:\n\n1. Thyroid function tests: These blood tests measure the levels of thyroid hormones in the body. High levels of thyroid hormones may indicate an overactive thyroid gland, which is a common symptom of Graves' disease.\n2. Radioactive iodine uptake (RAIU) test: This test measures how much iodine the thyroid gland absorbs. A high uptake of iodine may indicate an overactive thyroid gland, which is consistent with Graves' disease.\n3. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) receptor antibody test: This blood test measures the levels of TSH receptor antibodies...\n\n    Scoring guide:\n    1.

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: What are the treatments for Graves' Disease?\n\n    Reference Answer: People with Graves disease have three treatment options: radioiodine therapy, medications, and thyroid surgery. Radioiodine therapy is the most common treatment for Graves disease in the United States. Graves disease is often diagnosed and treated by an endocrinologista doctor who specializes in the bodys hormone- secreting glands.\n                \nRadioiodine Therapy\n                \nIn radioiodine therapy, patients take radioactive iodine-131 by mouth. Because the thyroid gland collects iodine to make thyroid hormone, it will collect the radioactive iodine from the bloodstream in the same way. Iodine-131stronger than the radioactive iodine used in diagnostic testsgradually destroys the cells that make up the thyroid gland but does not affect other body tissues.\n                \nMany health care providers use a large enough dose of iodine-131 to shut down the thyroid completely, but some prefer smaller doses to try to bring hormone production into the normal range. More than one round of radioiodine therapy may be needed. Results take time and people undergoing this treatment may not notice improvement in symptoms for several weeks or months.\n                \nPeople with GO should talk with a health care provider about any risks associated with radioactive iodine treatments. Several studies suggest radioiodine therapy can worsen GO in some people. Other treatments, such as prescription steroids, may prevent this complication.\n                \nAlthough iodine-131 is not known to cause birth defects or infertility, radioiodine therapy is not used in pregnant women or women who are breastfeeding. Radioactive iodine can be harmful to the fetus thyroid and can be passed from mother to child in breast milk. Experts recommend that women wait a year after treatment before becoming pregnant.\n                \nAlmost everyone who receives radioactive iodine treatment eventually develops hypothyroidism, which occurs when the thyroid does not make enough thyroid hormone. People with hypothyroidism must take synthetic thyroid hormone, a medication that replaces their natural thyroid hormone.\n                \nMedications\n                \nBeta blockers. Health care providers may prescribe a medication called a beta blocker to reduce many of the symptoms of hyperthyroidism, such as tremors, rapid heartbeat, and nervousness. But beta blockers do not stop thyroid hormone production.\n                \nAnti-thyroid medications. Health care providers sometimes prescribe anti-thyroid medications as the only treatment for Graves disease. Anti-thyroid medications interfere with thyroid hormone production but dont usually have permanent results. Use of these medications requires frequent monitoring by a health care provider. More often, anti-thyroid medications are used to pretreat patients before surgery or radioiodine therapy, or they are used as supplemental treatment after radioiodine therapy.\n                \nAnti-thyroid medications can cause side effects in some people, including\n                \n- allergic reactions such as rashes and itching  - a decrease in the number of white blood cells in the body, which can lower a persons resistance to infection  - liver failure, in rare cases\n                \nIn the United States, health care providers prescribe the anti-thyroid medication methimazole (Tapazole, Northyx) for most types of hyperthyroidism.\n                \nAnti-thyroid medications and pregnancy. Because pregnant and breastfeeding women cannot receive radioiodine therapy, they are usually treated with an anti-thyroid medication instead. However, experts agree that women in their first trimester of pregnancy should probably not take methimazole due to the rare occurrence of damage to the fetus.\n                \nAnother anti-thyroid medication, propylthiouracil (PTU), is available for women in this stage of pregnancy or for women who are allergic to or intolerant of methimazole and have no other treatment options. Health care providers may prescribe PTU for the first trimester of pregnancy and switch to methimazole for the second and third trimesters.\n                \nSome women are able to stop taking anti-thyroid medications in the last 4 to 8 weeks of pregnancy due to the remission of hyperthyroidism that occurs during pregnancy. However, these women should continue to be monitored for recurrence of thyroid problems following delivery.\n                \nStudies have shown that mothers taking anti-thyroid medications may safely breastfeed. However, they should take only moderate doses, less than 1020 milligrams daily, of the anti-thyroid medication methimazole. Doses should be divided and taken after feedings, and the infants should be monitored for side effects.2\n                \nWomen requiring higher doses of the anti-thyroid medication to control hyperthyroidism should not breastfeed.\n                \n2Ogunyemi DA. Autoimmune thyroid disease and pregnancy. emedicine website. emedicine.medscape.com/article/261913-overview. Updated March 12, 2012. Accessed April 10, 2012.\n                \nStop your anti-thyroid medication and call your health care provider right away if you develop any of the following while taking anti-thyroid medications:   - fatigue   - weakness   - yellowing of the skin or whites of the eyes   - loss of appetite   - nausea or vomiting\n                \nThyroid Surgery\n                \nSurgery is not commonly performed to treat Graves disease unless a patient has a very enlarged thyroid gland, called a goiter, or has cancerous nodules on the thyroid gland. In some cases, surgeons remove part of the thyroid gland, leaving enough of the gland so that the person will still produce some thyroid hormones. In other cases, the entire gland is removed. If the entire gland is removed, the person will need lifelong thyroid hormone replacement therapy.\n                \nThe primary advantage of surgery is that it allows for quick relief from symptoms. The primary disadvantage is that there is a risk of complications related to anesthesia and surgery, such as injury to nearby structures like the nerves that control the voice box larynx. A hoarse voice is a possible complication of thyroid surgery.\n                \nWhat are the benefits and drawbacks of each treatment option?\n                \nEach treatment option has its own advantages and disadvantages. For example, radioiodine therapy is often chosen because it is widely available and has a long-term success rate. However, it is not suitable for pregnant or breastfeeding women, and almost all patients eventually develop hypothyroidism. Medications can help manage symptoms but rarely result in long-term remission of Graves disease. Surgery carries risks related to anesthesia and surgery but can provide quick relief from symptoms.\n                \nHow can I find out more information about my treatment options?\n                \nTo learn more about your treatment options, you can\n                \n- ask your health care provider questions\n- contact organizations such as the American Thyroid Association at www.thyroid.org or the National Endocrine and Metabolic Diseases Information Service at endocrine.niddk.nih.gov\n- search for information online using reputable sources such as MedlinePlus at medlineplus.gov\n- join a support group, either online or in-person, to talk to others who have Graves disease\n\nBest answer: There are three main treatment options for Graves' disease: radioiodine therapy, medications, and thyroid surgery. Radioiodine therapy involves taking radioactive iodine-131 orally, which gradually destroys the thyroid gland's cells. Medications include beta blockers to reduce symptoms and anti-thyroid medications to interfere with thyroid hormone production. Thyroid surgery is typically reserved for those with a very enlarged thyroid gland or cancerous nodules. Each treatment option has its own benefits and drawbacks, and patients should discuss their individual situation with their healthcare provider to determine the best course of action",

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: How to diagnose Renal Artery Stenosis?\n\n    Reference Answer: A health care provider can diagnose RAS by listening to the abdomen with a stethoscope and performing imaging tests. When blood flows through a narrow artery, it sometimes makes a whooshing sound, called a bruit. The health care provider may place a stethoscope on the front or the side of the abdomen to listen for this sound. The absence of this sound, however, does not exclude the possibility of RAS.\n                \nIn some cases, RAS is found when a person has a test for another reason. For example, a health care provider may find RAS during a coronary angiogram for diagnosis of heart problems. A coronary angiogram is a procedure that uses a special dye, called contrast medium, and x rays to see how blood flows through the heart.\n                \nThe following imaging tests are used to diagnose RAS:\n                \n- Duplex ultrasound. Duplex ultrasound combines traditional ultrasound with Doppler ultrasonography. Traditional ultrasound uses a device, called a transducer, that bounces safe, painless sound waves off organs to create an image of their structure. Doppler ultrasonography records sound waves reflected off of moving objects, such as blood, to measure their speed and other aspects of how they flow. The procedure is performed in a health care providers office, outpatient center, or hospital by a specially trained technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologista doctor who specializes in medical imaging. Anesthesia is not needed. The images can show blockage in the renal artery or blood moving through nearby arteries at a lower-than-normal speed. Ultrasound is noninvasive and low cost.  - Catheter angiogram. A catheter angiogram, also called a traditional angiogram, is a special kind of x ray in which a thin, flexible tube called a catheter is threaded through the large arteries, often from the groin, to the artery of interestin this case, the renal artery. The procedure is performed in a hospital or outpatient center by a radiologist. Anesthesia is not needed though a sedative may be given to lessen anxiety during the procedure. Contrast medium is injected through the catheter so the renal artery shows up more clearly on the x ray. Catheter angiogram is the gold standard for diagnosing RAS due to the high quality of the image produced. In addition, severe RAS can be treated during the same visit. However, a catheter angiogram is an invasive procedure, and a person may have side effects from the sedative or contrast medium or may have bleeding or injury to the artery from the catheter. The procedure is also more expensive than other imaging tests.  - Computerized tomographic angiography (CTA) scan. CTA scans use a combination of x rays and computer technology to create images. The procedure is performed in an outpatient center or hospital by an x-ray technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologist. Anesthesia is not needed. Contrast medium is injected into a vein in the persons arm to better see the structure of the arteries. CTA scans require the person to lie on a table that slides into a tunnel-shaped device where the x rays are taken. CTA scans are less invasive than catheter angiograms and take less time. However, the risks from the x-ray radiation still exist, and the test often requires more contrast medium than a catheter angiogram, so it may not be recommended for a person with poor kidney function.  - Magnetic resonance angiogram (MRA). MRA uses radio waves and magnets to produce detailed pictures of the bodys internal organs and soft tissues without using x rays. The procedure is performed in an outpatient center or hospital by an x-ray technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologist. Anesthesia is not needed though light sedation may be used for people with a fear of confined spaces. Contrast medium may be injected into a vein in the persons arm to better see the structure of the arteries. With most MRA scans, the person lies on a table that slides into a tunnel-shaped device...\n\n    Generated Answer: Renal artery stenosis is typically diagnosed through a combination of methods:\n\n1.

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: What are the treatments for Renal Artery Stenosis?\n\n    Reference Answer: Treatment for RAS includes lifestyle changes, medications, and surgery and aims to\n                \n- prevent RAS from getting worse  - treat RVH  - relieve the blockage of the renal arteries\n                \nRAS that has not led to RVH or caused a significant blockage of the artery may not need treatment. RAS that needs to be treated, also called critical RAS, is defined by the American Heart Association as a reduction by more than 60 percent in the diameter of the renal artery.1 However, health care providers are not exactly sure what degree of blockage will cause significant problems.\n                \nLifestyle Changes\n                \nThe first step in treating RAS is making lifestyle changes that promote healthy blood vessels throughout the body, including the renal arteries. The best ways to keep plaque from building up in the arteries are to exercise, maintain a healthy body weight, and choose healthy foods. People who smoke should quit to help protect their kidneys and other internal organs.\n                \nMedications\n                \nPeople with RVH may need to take medications thatwhen taken as prescribed by their health care providerlower blood pressure and can also significantly slow the progression of kidney disease. Two types of blood pressure-lowering medications, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), have proven effective in slowing the progression of kidney disease. Many people require two or more medications to control their blood pressure. In addition to an ACE inhibitor or an ARB, a diuretica medication that helps the kidneys remove fluid from the bloodmay be prescribed. Beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, and other blood pressure medications may also be needed. Some people with RAS cannot take an ACE inhibitor or ARB due to the effects on the kidneys. People with RAS who are prescribed an ACE inhibitor or ARB should have their kidney function checked within a few weeks of starting the medication.\n                \nA cholesterol-lowering medication to prevent plaque from building up in the arteries and a blood-thinner, such as aspirin, to help the blood flow more easily through the arteries may also be prescribed.\n                \nSurgery\n                \nAlthough surgery has been used in the past for treatment of RAS due to atherosclerosis, recent studies have not shown improved outcomes with surgery compared with medication. However, surgery may be recommended for people with RAS caused by FMD or RAS that does not improve with medication. Different types of surgery for RAS include the following. The procedures are performed in a hospital by a vascular surgeona doctor who specializes in repairing blood vessels. Anesthesia is needed.\n                \n- Angioplasty and stenting. Angioplasty is a procedure in which a catheter is put into the renal artery, usually through the groin, just as in a catheter angiogram. In addition, for angioplasty, a tiny balloon at the end of the catheter can be inflated to flatten the plaque against the artery wall. A small mesh tube, called a stent, may then be positioned inside the artery to keep plaque flattened and the artery open. People with RAS caused by FMD may be successfully treated with angioplasty alone, while angioplasty with stenting has a better outcome for people with RAS...\n\n    Generated Answer: Treatment for renal artery stenosis often involves a combination of lifestyle changes, medications, and in some cases, surgical procedures.\n\n1. Lifestyle changes: These may include quitting smoking, eating a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and controlling other medical conditions such as high blood pressure and diabetes.\n2. Medications: Medications may be used to lower blood pressure, reduce cholesterol levels, prevent blood clots, and improve blood flow to the kidneys.\n3. Angioplasty and stenting: In this procedure, a catheter is inserted through a small incision in the groin and guided to the renal artery. A balloon is then...\n\n    Scoring guide:\n    1.

They are located just below the rib cage, one on each side of the spine. Every day, the two kidneys filter about 120 to 150 quarts of blood to produce about 1 to 2 quarts of urine, composed of wastes and extra fluid. Children produce less urine than adults and the amount produced depends on their age. The kidneys work around the clock; a person does not control what they do. Ureters are the thin tubes of muscleone on each side of the bladderthat carry urine from each of the kidneys to the bladder. The bladder stores urine until the person finds an appropriate time and place to urinate.\n                \nThe kidney is not one large filter. Each kidney is made up of about a million filtering units called nephrons. Each nephron filters a small amount of blood. The nephron includes a filter, called a glomerulus, and a tubule. The nephrons work through a two-step process. The glomerulus lets fluid and waste products pass through it; however, it prevents blood cells and large molecules, mostly proteins, from...\n\n    Generated Answer: Kidney disease in children, also known as pediatric kidney disease, refers to conditions that affect the proper functioning of the kidneys. The kidneys play a vital role in maintaining the body's balance by removing waste and excess fluids, releasing hormones to regulate blood pressure and red blood cell production, and controlling electrolyte levels.\n\nThere are several types of kidney disease that can affect children, including:\n\n1. Congenital anomalies: These are abnormalities that children are born with, such as obstructive uropathy, renal dysplasia, or polycystic kidney disease.\n2. Glomerulonephritis: This is a group of conditions that affect the glomeruli, the tiny filters in the kidneys that remove waste from the blood.\n3. Nephrotic syndrome: This is a condition that causes the kidneys to leak large amounts of protein into the urine, leading to swelling in the legs, ankles, and feet.\n4. Hemolytic uremic syndrome: This is a rare condition that occurs when red blood cells are destroyed and block the kidneys' filtering system.\n5. Lupus nephritis: This is a kidney disease that occurs in children with lupus, an autoimmune disorder that causes inflammation throughout the body.\n6. Inherited kidney diseases: These are genetic conditions that affect the kidneys, such as Alport syndrome or polycystic kidney disease.\n\nSymptoms of kidney disease in children can vary depending on the type and severity of the condition.

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: What causes Overview of Kidney Disease in Children?\n\n    Reference Answer: Kidney disease in children can be caused by\n                \n- birth defects  - hereditary diseases  - infection  - nephrotic syndrome  - systemic diseases  - trauma  - urine blockage or reflux\n                \nFrom birth to age 4, birth defects and hereditary diseases are the leading causes of kidney failure. Between ages 5 and 14, kidney failure is most commonly caused by hereditary diseases, nephrotic syndrome, and systemic diseases. Between ages 15 and 19, diseases that affect the glomeruli are the leading cause of kidney failure, and hereditary diseases become less common.1\n                \nBirth Defects\n                \nA birth defect is a problem that happens while a baby is developing in the mothers womb. Birth defects that affect the kidneys include renal agenesis, renal dysplasia, and ectopic kidney, to name a few. These defects are abnormalities of size, structure, or position of the kidneys:\n                \n- renal agenesischildren born with only one kidney  - renal dysplasiachildren born with both kidneys, yet one does not function  - ectopic kidneychildren born with a kidney that is located below, above, or on the opposite side of its usual position\n                \nIn general, children with these conditions lead full, healthy lives. However, some children with renal agenesis or renal dysplasia are at increased risk for developing kidney disease.\n                \nHereditary Diseases\n                \nHereditary kidney diseases are illnesses passed from parent to child through the genes. One example is polycystic kidney disease (PKD), characterized by many grapelike clusters of fluid-filled cystsabnormal sacsthat make both kidneys larger over time. These cysts take over and destroy working kidney tissue. Another hereditary disease is Alport syndrome, which is caused by a mutation in a gene for a type of protein called collagen that makes up the glomeruli. The condition leads to scarring of the kidneys. Alport syndrome generally develops in early childhood and is more serious in boys than in girls. The condition can lead to hearing and vision problems in addition to kidney disease.\n                \nInfection\n                \nHemolytic uremic syndrome and acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis are kidney diseases that can develop in a child after an infection.\n                \n- Hemolytic uremic syndrome is a rare disease that is often caused by the Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacterium found in contaminated foods, such as meat, dairy products, and juice. Hemolytic uremic syndrome develops when E. coli bacteria lodged in the digestive tract make toxins that enter the bloodstream. The toxins start to destroy red blood cells and damage the lining of the blood vessels, including the glomeruli. Most children who get an E. coli infection have vomiting, stomach cramps, and bloody diarrhea for 2 to 3 days. Children who develop hemolytic uremic syndrome become pale, tired, and irritable. Hemolytic uremic syndrome can lead to kidney failure in some children.  - Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis can occur after an episode of strep throat or a skin infection. The Streptococcus bacterium does not attack the kidneys directly; instead, the infection may stimulate the immune system to overproduce antibodies. Antibodies are proteins made by the immune system. The immune system protects people from infection by identifying and destroying bacteria, viruses, and other potentially harmful foreign substances. When the extra antibodies circulate in the blood and finally deposit in the glomeruli, the kidneys can be damaged. Most cases of post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis develop 1 to 3 weeks after an untreated infection, though it may be as long as 6 weeks. Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis lasts only a brief time and the kidneys usually recover. In a few cases, kidney damage may be permanent.\n                \nNephrotic Syndrome\n                \nNephrotic syndrome is a collection of symptoms that indicate kidney damage. Nephrotic syndrome includes all of the following conditions:\n                \n- albuminuriawhen a persons urine contains an elevated level of albumin, a protein typically found in the blood  - hyperlipidemiahigher-than-normal fat and cholesterol levels in the blood  - edemaswelling, usually in the legs, feet, or ankles and less often in the hands or face  - hypoalbuminemialow levels of albumin in the blood\n                \nNephrotic syndrome in children can be caused by the following conditions:\n                \n- Minimal change disease is a condition characterized by damage to the glomeruli that can be seen only with an electron microscope, which shows tiny details better than any other type of microscope. The cause of minimal change disease is unknown; some health care providers think it may occur after allergic reactions, asthma, or eczema. Minimal change disease is the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in children.  - Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis is a condition where scar tissue develops on the parts of the kidneys that filter waste from the blood. Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis is more common among African Americans and Hispanic Americans than among Caucasians.  - Membranous nephropathy is a condition where changes in the structure of the glomeruli lead to kidney dysfunction. Membranous nephropathy is more common among adults than children.\n                \nSystemic Diseases\n                \nSome diseases that affect multiple parts of the body can also harm the kidneys. Examples include:\n                \n- diabetes  - lupus  - rheumatoid arthritis\n                \nTrauma\n                \nPhysical injury to the kidneys can cause them to malfunction. For example, a severe blow to the flank area can damage kidney tissue and disrupt blood flow to the kidneys.\n                \nUrine Blockage or Reflux\n                \nBlockages in the urinary tract can increase pressure in the kidneys and impair their function. Urine blockage can be caused by:\n                \n- kidney stones  - tumors  - blood clots\n                \nReflux occurs when urine flows backward from the bladder into the kidneys. This backflow can cause scarring of the kidneys and is known as vesicoureteral reflux. Reflux can happen even if a child does not have an obstruction in the urinary tract. Some children are born with a misshapen valve between the bladder and ureters that allows urine to flow backward into the kidneys. In other cases, the valve is normal but does not work correctly.\n                \nThe severity of kidney disease in children varies widely depending on the underlying cause and whether the disease is acute or chronic. Acute kidney disease develops rapidly, within hours or days, and is temporary. Chronic kidney disease develops gradually and persists over time. Chronic kidney disease can be mild or severe, progressive or stable. Mild kidney disease may not lead to other health problems, but more severe kidney disease can lead to complications such as high blood pressure, bone disease, and anemia.",

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: What are the treatments for Overview of Kidney Disease in Children?\n\n    Reference Answer: Treatment for kidney disease in children depends on the cause of the illness. A child may be referred to a pediatric nephrologista doctor who specializes in treating kidney diseases and kidney failure in childrenfor treatment.\n                \nChildren with a kidney disease that is causing high blood pressure may need to take medications to lower their blood pressure. Improving blood pressure can significantly slow the progression of kidney disease. The health care provider may prescribe\n                \n- angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, which help relax blood vessels and make it easier for the heart to pump blood  - angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), which help relax blood vessels and make it easier for the heart to pump blood  - diuretics, medications that increase urine output\n                \nMany children require two or more medications to control their blood pressure; other types of blood pressure medications may also be needed.\n                \nAs kidney function declines, children may need treatment for anemia and growth failure. Anemia is treated with a hormone called erythropoietin, which stimulates the bone marrow to produce red blood cells. Children with growth failure may need to make dietary changes and take food supplements or growth hormone injections.\n                \nChildren with kidney disease that leads to kidney failure must receive treatment to replace the work the kidneys do. The two types of treatment are dialysis and transplantation. More information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Treatment Methods for Kidney Failure in Children.\n                \nBirth Defects\n                \nChildren with renal agenesis or renal dysplasia should be monitored for signs of kidney damage. Treatment is not needed unless damage to the kidney occurs. More information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Solitary Kidney.\n                \nEctopic kidney does not need to be treated unless it causes a blockage in the urinary tract or damage to the kidney. When a blockage is present, surgery may be needed to correct the position of the kidney for better drainage of urine. If extensive kidney damage has occurred, surgery may be needed to remove the kidney. More information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Ectopic Kidney.\n                \nHereditary Diseases\n                \nChildren with PKD tend to have frequent urinary tract infections, which are treated with bacteria-fighting medications called antibiotics. PKD cannot be cured, so children with the condition receive treatment to slow the progression of kidney disease and treat the complications of PKD. More information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Polycystic Kidney Disease.\n                \nAlport syndrome also has no cure. Children with the condition receive treatment to slow disease progression and treat complications until the kidneys fail. More information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Glomerular Diseases.\n                \nInfection\n                \nTreatment for hemolytic uremic syndrome includes maintaining normal salt and fluid levels in the body to ease symptoms and prevent further problems. A child may need a transfusion of red blood cells delivered through an intravenous (IV) tube. Some children may need dialysis for a short time to take over the work the kidneys usually do. Most children recover completely with no long-term consequences. More information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome in Children.\n                \nChildren with post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis may be treated with antibiotics to destroy any bacteria that remain in the body and with medications to control swelling and high blood pressure. They may also need dialysis for a short period of time. More information about post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Glomerular Diseases.\n                \nNephrotic Syndrome\n                \nNephrotic syndrome due to minimal change disease can often be successfully treated with corticosteroids. Corticosteroids decrease swelling and reduce the activity of the immune system. The dosage of the medication is decreased over time. Relapses are common; however, they usually respond to treatment. Corticosteroids are less effective in treating nephrotic syndrome due to focal segmental glomerulosclerosis or membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis. Children with these conditions may be given other immunosuppressive medications in addition to corticosteroids. Immunosuppressive medications prevent the body from making antibodies. More information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Childhood Nephrotic Syndrome.\n                \nSystemic Diseases\n                \nLupus nephritis is treated with corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive medications. A child with lupus nephritis may also be treated with blood pressure-lowering medications. In many cases, treatment is effective in completely or partially controlling lupus nephritis. More information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Lupus Nephritis.\n                \nDiabetic kidney disease usually takes many years to develop. Children with diabetes can prevent or slow the onset of diabetic kidney disease by keeping their blood glucose level as close to normal as possible. More information is provided in the NIDDK health topics, Preventing Diabetic Kidney Disease and Diabetic Kidney Disease.\n                \nObstructive Uropathy\n                \nChildren with obstructive uropathy may need surgery to relieve the obstruction. Surgery may involve placing a cathetera thin, flexible tubeinto the bladder through the abdomen to drain urine into a bag outside the body. Sometimes, a stent is placed inside the blocked area to keep it open. More information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Urinary Tract Obstruction.\n                \nReflux Nephropathy\n                \nChildren with reflux nephropathy may need antibiotics to treat recurring UTIs. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to improve the flow of urine from the kidneys to the bladder. More information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Vesicoureteral Reflux.\n                \nOther Kidney Problems\n                \nChildren with kidney stones may need pain relief medications and plenty of fluids to help pass the stone. Large stones may need to be surgically removed. More information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Kidney Stones in Children.\n                \nChildren with Wilms tumor will need surgery to remove the affected kidney. Chemotherapy and radiation therapy may also be used to kill cancer cells. More information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Wilms Tumor and Other Childhood Cancers.\n                \nChildren with rhabdoid tumors of the kidney will need chemotherapy and radiation therapy to kill cancer cells. Surgery may also be performed to remove the affected kidney. More information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Rhabdoid Tumors of the Kidney.\n                \nChildren with cystinosis may need to follow a special diet to slow the progression of kidney disease. Medications such as phosphorus binders and alkali may be prescribed to help manage the condition. More information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Cystinosis.\n                \nChildren with oxalosis may need to drink large amounts of water and limit foods high in oxalate, such as spinach, beets, rhubarb, strawberries, chocolate, and nuts. Medications such as phosphorus binders and alkali may be prescribed to help manage the condition. More information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Oxalosis and Hyperoxaluria.\n                \nChildren with Bartters syndrome may need to take potassium supplements and medications to manage the",

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: What to do for Overview of Kidney Disease in Children?\n\n    Reference Answer: For children with CKD, learning about nutrition is vital because their diet can affect how well their kidneys work. Parents or guardians should always consult with their childs health care team before making any dietary changes. Staying healthy with CKD requires paying close attention to the following elements of a diet:\n                \n- Protein. Children with CKD should eat enough protein for growth while limiting high protein intake. Too much protein can put an extra burden on the kidneys and cause kidney function to decline faster. Protein needs increase when a child is on dialysis because the dialysis process removes protein from the childs blood. The health care team recommends the amount of protein needed for the child. Foods with protein include      - eggs    - milk    - cheese    - chicken    - fish    - red meats    - beans    - yogurt    - cottage cheese    - Sodium. The amount of sodium children need depends on the stage of their kidney disease, their age, and sometimes other factors. The health care team may recommend limiting or adding sodium and salt to the diet. Foods high in sodium include      - canned foods    - some frozen foods    - most processed foods    - some snack foods, such as chips and crackers    - Potassium. Potassium levels need to stay in the normal range for children with CKD, because too little or too much potassium can cause heart and muscle problems. Children may need to stay away from some fruits and vegetables or reduce the number of servings and portion sizes to make sure they do not take in too much potassium. The health care team recommends the amount of potassium a child needs. Low-potassium fruits and vegetables include      - apples    - cranberries    - strawberries    - blueberries    - raspberries    - pineapple    - cabbage    - boiled cauliflower    - mustard greens    - uncooked broccoli    - High-potassium fruits and vegetables include      - oranges    - melons    - apricots    - bananas    - potatoes    - tomatoes    - sweet potatoes    - cooked spinach    - cooked broccoli    - Phosphorus. Children with CKD need to control the level of phosphorus in their blood because too much phosphorus pulls calcium from the bones, making them weaker and more likely to break. Too much phosphorus also can cause itchy skin and red eyes. As CKD progresses, a child may need to take a phosphate binder with meals to lower the concentration of phosphorus in the blood. Phosphorus is found in high-protein foods. Foods with low levels of phosphorus include      - liquid nondairy creamer    - green beans    - popcorn    - unprocessed meats from a butcher    - lemon-lime soda    - root beer    - powdered iced tea and lemonade mixes    - rice and corn cereals    - egg white    -...\n\n    Generated Answer: I am an artificial intelligence and not a doctor, but I can provide some general advice on what to do for an overview of kidney disease in children.\n\nIf you suspect your child has kidney disease, it is essential to consult with a healthcare professional as soon as possible. A pediatrician or a pediatric nephrologist (a doctor who specializes in children's kidney problems) can evaluate your child's symptoms, perform diagnostic tests, and provide appropriate treatment.\n\nSome common symptoms of kidney disease in children include:\n\n* Frequent urination or bedwetting\n* Blood in the urine\n* Foamy or bubbly urine\n* Pain in the back or sides\n* Poor growth or development\n* High blood pressure\n* Anemia (low red blood cell count)\n\nDiagnostic tests for kidney disease in children may include:\n\n* Urine tests to check for protein and blood\n* Blood tests to measure kidney function\n* Imaging tests, such as ultrasounds or CT scans, to visualize the kidneys\n* Kidney biopsy to examine kidney tissue\n\nTreatment for kidney disease in children depends on the underlying cause and severity of the condition. Treatment options may include:\n\n* Medications to control blood pressure, reduce protein in the...\n\n    Scoring guide:\n    1. Scientific Consensus: 1=Aligned, 0=No consensus, -1=Opposed\n    2.

Of the approximately 7,700 people who received NHPP pituitary hGH, 29 people got CJD. The two things that seem to be connected with getting CJD after pituitary hGH treatment are\n                \n1. How long a person was treated:\n                \n- In the United States, the average length of time for pituitary hGH treatment through the NHPP was about 3 years. For those individuals who developed CJD, the average length of treatment was about 8.4 years.  - Even though longer treatment time increased the risk for CJD in the United States, in other countries CJD has developed after shorter treatment periods.\n                \n2. When a person was treated:\n                \n- All of the 29 individuals treated with NHPP hGH who got CJD in the United States started pituitary hGH before 1977. No CJD has been reported in Americans who began treatment with NHPP hormone after 1977, when production of NHPP hormone was moved to a laboratory (headed by Dr. Albert Parlow) that used a new method of purifying pituitary hGH. Research in animals showed the newer purification steps introduced in 1977 reduced the risk of CJD transmission. Recently, an analysis of NHPP hGH recipients was completed taking into account the differences in follow-up time and the duration of treatment of recipients starting treatment before or after 1977. That analysis found that the new purification steps greatly reduced and may have eliminated the risk for CJD infection.  - Two cases of CJD have been reported in individuals who received commercially prepared pituitary hGH. An Austrian person was treated with pituitary hGH (Crescormon, from Kabi Pharma) for 14 months and died from CJD 22 years later. An American who was too tall to be eligible for NHPP hormone was treated with pituitary hGH made by two pharmaceutical companies (Asellacrin, from Serono, and Crescormon, from Kabi Pharma). This individual was treated with commercial hGH for 23 months and died just over 26 years later. The methods used to produce these commercial hormone preparations were not identical to the method used in Dr. Parlow's laboratory but did include...\n\n    Generated Answer: The National Hormone and Pituitary Program (NHPP) was a program in the United States that provided pituitary human growth hormone (hGH) to patients from 1963 to 1985.

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: What causes National Hormone and Pituitary Program (NHPP): Information for People Treated with Pituitary Human Growth Hormone (Comprehensive Report)?\n\n    Reference Answer: We have not found any particular preparation of pituitary hGH that is especially likely to carry CJD. We believe that CJD did not come from a single infected pituitary gland or preparation. Prior to 1977, in an effort to extract as much hormone as possible from the pituitary glands, the glands were often processed repeatedly. Hormone extracted from the same pituitaries was often included in many hormone preparations. Also, patients who got CJD were treated on average for 8.4 years and received many different hormone preparations. This makes it very difficult to identify any preparation associated with transmitting CJD.\n                \nDoctors wanted to see if a specific preparation of pituitary hGH could transmit CJD. To try to find the pituitary hGH that could have caused CJD, HHS researchers did two things:\n                \n1. They set up a test in animals, injecting samples of all available preparations of pituitary hGH directly into the brains of monkeys. CJD develops more rapidly if injected into the brain than under the skin, as hGH was used in people. The animals were watched for 10 years. The brains of all animals were examined for signs of CJD. If an animal got sick with CJD, it would help researchers to understand which vials of pituitary hGH were contaminated with the agent that causes CJD.\n                \n2. They studied people treated with pituitary hGH to see who got CJD and which hormone preparation they might have received based on which preparations were sent to their doctor.\n                \nResults:\n                \n- The animal tests did not help find the pituitary hGH that might have caused CJD. One animal developed the disease 5 years after injection of pituitary hGH. Two other animals that received injections from different vials of the same pituitary hGH preparation did not develop CJD.  - None of the people who developed CJD are known to have received the hormone preparation that made the animal sick. At most, two patients (whose records are incomplete) may have received this pituitary hGH preparation. Because of this, we do not believe that the patients who received the hormone preparation that transmitted CJD to the animal have a greater risk of developing CJD than others treated with pituitary hGH. Because each preparation of pituitary hGH was used to fill multiple vials, it is not known if CJD contamination was spread evenly among all vials of...\n\n    Generated Answer: I'm a helpful AI and I don't diagnose or treat medical conditions.

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: How to diagnose Hashimoto's Disease?\n\n    Reference Answer: Diagnosis begins with a physical exam and medical history. A goiter, nodules, or growths may be found during a physical exam, and symptoms may suggest hypothyroidism. Health care providers will then perform blood tests to confirm the diagnosis. A blood test involves drawing blood at a health care providers office or a commercial facility and sending the sample to a lab for analysis. Diagnostic blood tests may include the\n                \n- TSH test. The ultrasensitive TSH test is usually the first test performed. This test detects even tiny amounts of TSH in the blood and is the most accurate measure of thyroid activity available. Generally, a TSH reading above normal means a person has hypothyroidism.  - T4 test. The T4 test measures the actual amount of thyroid hormone circulating in the blood. In hypothyroidism, the level of T4 in the blood is lower than normal.  - antithyroid antibody test. This test looks for the presence of thyroid autoantibodies, or molecules produced by a persons body that mistakenly attack the bodys own tissues. Two principal types of antithyroid antibodies are      - anti-TG antibodies, which attack a protein in the thyroid called thyroglobulin    - anti-thyroperoxidase (TPO) antibodies, which attack an enzyme called thyroperoxidase in thyroid cells that helps convert T4 to T3. Having TPO autoantibodies in the blood means the bodys immune system attacked the thyroid tissue in the past. Most people with Hashimotos disease have these antibodies, although people whose hypothyroidism is caused by other conditions do not.\n                \nA health care provider may also order imaging tests, including an ultrasound or a computerized tomography (CT) scan.\n                \n- Ultrasound. Ultrasound uses a device, called a transducer, that bounces safe, painless sound waves off organs to create an image of their structure. A specially trained technician performs the procedure in a health care providers office, an outpatient center, or a hospital, and a radiologista doctor who specializes in medical imaginginterprets the images; a patient does not need anesthesia.\n                \n- The images can show the size and texture of the thyroid, as well as a pattern of typical autoimmune inflammation, helping the health care provider confirm Hashimotos disease. The images can also show nodules or growths within the gland that suggest a malignant tumor.\n                \n- CT scan. CT scans use a combination of x rays and computer technology to create images. For a CT scan, a health care provider may give the patient a solution to drink and an injection of a special dye, called contrast medium. CT scans require the patient to lie on a...\n\n    Generated Answer: Hashimoto's disease is typically diagnosed through a combination of physical examination, medical history, and laboratory tests. During the physical examination, a doctor may check for signs of thyroid enlargement or other abnormalities. They may also ask about any symptoms you are experiencing and your personal and family medical history.\n\nLaboratory tests are the most reliable way to diagnose Hashimoto's disease. These tests typically include:\n\n1. Thyroid function tests: These tests measure the levels of thyroid hormones in your blood. People with Hashimoto's disease often have low levels of thyroid hormones.\n2. Thyroid antibody tests: These tests measure the levels of antibodies against thyroid peroxidase (TPO) and thyroglobulin (Tg) in your...\n\n    Scoring guide:\n    1.

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: What causes Urinary Retention?\n\n    Reference Answer: Urinary retention can result from\n                \n- obstruction of the urethra  - nerve problems  - medications  - weakened bladder muscles\n                \nObstruction of the Urethra\n                \nObstruction of the urethra causes urinary retention by blocking the normal urine flow out of the body. Conditions such as benign prostatic hyperplasiaalso called BPHurethral stricture, urinary tract stones, cystocele, rectocele, constipation, and certain tumors and cancers can cause an obstruction.\n                \nBenign prostatic hyperplasia. For men in their 50s and 60s, urinary retention is often caused by prostate enlargement due to benign prostatic hyperplasia. Benign prostatic hyperplasia is a medical condition in which the prostate gland is enlarged and not cancerous. The prostate is a walnut-shaped gland that is part of the male reproductive system. The gland surrounds the urethra at the neck of the bladder. The bladder neck is the area where the urethra joins the bladder. The prostate goes through two main periods of growth. The first occurs early in puberty, when the prostate doubles in size. The second phase of growth begins around age 25 and continues during most of a mans life. Benign prostatic hyperplasia often occurs with the second phase of growth.\n                \nAs the prostate enlarges, the gland presses against and pinches the urethra. The bladder wall becomes thicker. Eventually, the bladder may weaken and lose the ability to empty completely, leaving some urine in the bladder.\n                \nMore information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Prostate Enlargement: Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia.\n                \nUrethral stricture. A urethral stricture is a narrowing or closure of the urethra. Causes of urethral stricture include inflammation and scar tissue from surgery, disease, recurring UTIs, or injury. In men, a urethral stricture may result from prostatitis, scarring after an injury to the penis or perineum, or surgery for benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer. Prostatitis is a frequently painful condition that involves inflammation of the prostate and sometimes the areas around the prostate. The perineum is the area between the anus and the sex organs. Since men have a longer urethra than women, urethral stricture is more common in men than women.1\n                \nMore information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Prostatitis: Inflammation of the Prostate.\n                \nSurgery to correct pelvic organ prolapse, such as cystocele and rectocele, and urinary incontinence can also cause urethral stricture. The urethral stricture often gets better a few weeks after surgery.\n                \nUrethral stricture and acute or chronic urinary retention may occur when the muscles surrounding the urethra do not relax. This condition happens mostly in women.\n                \nUrinary tract stones. Urinary tract stones develop from crystals that form in the urine and build up on the inner surfaces of the kidneys, ureters, or bladder. The stones formed or lodged in the bladder may block the opening to the urethra.\n                \nCystocele. A cystocele is a bulging of the bladder into the vagina. A cystocele occurs when the muscles and supportive tissues between a womans bladder and vagina weaken and stretch, letting the bladder sag from its normal position and bulge into the vagina. The abnormal position of the bladder may cause it to press against and pinch the urethra.\n                \nMore information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Cystocele.\n                \nRectocele. A rectocele is a bulging of the rectum into the vagina. A rectocele occurs when the muscles and supportive tissues between a womans rectum and vagina weaken and stretch, letting the rectum sag from its normal position and bulge into the vagina. The abnormal position of the rectum may cause it to press against and pinch the urethra.\n                \nConstipation. Constipation is a condition in which a person has fewer than three bowel movements a week or has bowel movements with stools that are hard, dry, and small, making them painful or difficult to pass. A person with constipation may feel bloated or have pain in the abdomen the area between the chest and hips. Some people with constipation often have to strain to have a bowel movement. Hard stools in the rectum may push against the bladder and urethra, causing the urethra to be pinched, especially if a rectocele is present.\n                \nMore information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Constipation.\n                \nTumors and cancers. Tumors and cancerous tissues in the bladder or urethra can gradually expand and obstruct urine flow by pressing against and pinching the urethra.\n                \nNerve Problems\n                \nNerve problems can cause urinary retention by interrupting communication between the nerves in the spinal cord and the muscle that squeezes urine out of the bladder. People with diabetes may experience nerve damage over time, leading to difficulty emptying the bladder. Other conditions that can injure bladder nerves and cause urinary retention include stroke, multiple sclerosis, Parkinsons disease, and spinal cord injury.\n                \nMedications\n                \nCertain medications can change the muscle tone in the urinary tract and affect the nerves controlling the bladder. Medications known to contribute to urinary retention include\n                \ndecongestants\nantihistamines\nanticholinergics\nopioids\ncertain antidepressants\ncertain antipsychotics\n                \nWeakened Bladder Muscles\n                \nAging can weaken the bladder muscles, decreasing the amount of pressure applied to force urine out of the bladder. Weakened bladder muscles can lead to overflow incontinence, a type of urinary incontinence in which the bladder cannot empty properly and then spills over when the bladder is too full.\n                \nProlonged bed rest, lack of physical activity, and certain medications can also weaken bladder muscles.\n                \nOther Factors\n                \nOther factors that can increase the risk of developing urinary retention include\n                \nprolonged labor during childbirth\nmenopause\npelvic trauma\nprostate cancer treatment\nspinal cord injuries\nstroke\n                \nThe best answer is Urinary retention can result from obstruction of the urethra, nerve problems, medications, weakened bladder muscles.",

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: How to diagnose Urinary Retention?\n\n    Reference Answer: A health care provider diagnoses acute or chronic urinary retention with\n                \n- a physical exam  - postvoid residual measurement\n                \nA health care provider may use the following medical tests to help determine the cause of urinary retention:\n                \n- cystoscopy  - computerized tomography (CT) scans  - urodynamic tests  - electromyography\n                \nPhysical Exam\n                \nA health care provider may suspect urinary retention because of a patients symptoms and, therefore, perform a physical exam of the lower abdomen. The health care provider may be able to feel a distended bladder by lightly tapping on the lower belly.\n                \nPostvoid Residual Measurement\n                \nThis test measures the amount of urine left in the bladder after urination. The remaining urine is called the postvoid residual. A specially trained technician performs an ultrasound, which uses harmless sound waves to create a picture of the bladder, to measure the postvoid residual. The technician performs the bladder ultrasound in a health care providers office, a radiology center, or a hospital, and a radiologista doctor who specializes in medical imaginginterprets the images. The patient does not need anesthesia.\n                \nA health care provider may use a cathetera thin, flexible tubeto measure postvoid residual. The health care provider inserts the catheter through the urethra into the bladder, a procedure called catheterization, to drain and measure the amount of remaining urine. A postvoid residual of 100 mL or more indicates the bladder does not empty completely. A health care provider performs this test during an office visit. The patient often receives local anesthesia.\n                \nMedical Tests\n                \nCystoscopy. Cystoscopy is a procedure that requires a tubelike instrument, called a cystoscope, to look inside the urethra and bladder. A health care provider performs cystoscopy during an office visit or in an outpatient center or a hospital. The patient will receive local anesthesia. However, in some cases, the patient may receive sedation and regional or general anesthesia. A health care provider may use cystoscopy to diagnose urethral stricture or look for a bladder stone blocking the opening of the urethra.\n                \nMore information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Cystoscopy and Ureteroscopy.\n                \nCT scans. CT scans use a combination of x rays and computer technology to create images. For a CT scan, a health care provider may give the patient a solution to drink and an injection of a special dye, called contrast medium. CT scans require the patient to lie on a table that slides into a tunnel-shaped device where a technician takes the x rays. An x-ray technician performs the procedure in an outpatient center or a hospital, and a radiologist interprets the images. The patient does not need anesthesia. A health care provider may give infants and children a sedative to help them fall asleep for the test. CT scans can show\n                \n- urinary tract stones  - UTIs  - tumors  - traumatic injuries  - abnormal, fluid-containing sacs called cysts\n                \nUrodynamic tests. Urodynamic tests include a variety of procedures that look at how well the bladder and urethra store and release urine. A health care provider may use one or more urodynamic tests to diagnose urinary retention. The health care provider will perform these tests during an office visit. For tests that use a catheter, the patient often receives local anesthesia.\n                \n- Uroflowmetry. Uroflowmetry measures urine speed and volume. Special equipment automatically measures the amount of urine and the flow ratehow fast urine comes out. Uroflowmetry equipment includes a device for catching and measuring urine and a computer to record the data. The equipment creates a graph that shows changes in flow rate from second to second so the health care provider can see the highest flow rate and how many seconds it takes to get there. A weak bladder muscle or blocked urine flow will yield an abnormal test result.  - Pressure flow study. A pressure flow study measures the bladder pressure required to urinate and the flow rate a given pressure generates. A health care provider places a catheter with a manometer into the bladder. The manometer measures bladder pressure and flow rate as the bladder empties. A pressure flow study helps diagnose bladder outlet obstruction.  - Video urodynamics. This test uses x rays or ultrasound to create real-time images of the bladder and urethra during the filling or emptying of the bladder. For x rays, a health care provider passes a catheter through the urethra into the bladder. He or she fills the bladder with contrast medium, which is visible on the video images. Video urodynamic images can show the size and shape of the urinary tract, the flow of urine, and causes of urinary retention, such as bladder neck obstruction.\n                \nMore information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Urodynamic Testing.\n                \nElectromyography\n                \nAn electromyogram measures the electrical activity of muscles and nerve cells that control the muscles. A health care provider may use electromyography to evaluate the function of the pelvic floor muscles and their nerve supply. Electromyography can help diagnose problems with the nerves controlling bladder function.\n                \nThe health care provider applies electrodes to the perineumthe area between the scrotum and anus in men and between the vagina and anus in womenand sometimes to the skin near the urethra. The electrodes pick up the electrical signals produced by the muscles and send them to a machine for recording. The test takes about 30 minutes and does not require anesthesia.",

            "raw_response": "Evaluate this medical answer based on the criteria below. Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: What are the treatments for Urinary Retention?\n\n    Reference Answer: A health care provider treats urinary retention with\n                \n- bladder drainage  - urethral dilation  - urethral stents  - prostate medications  - surgery\n                \nThe type and length of treatment depend on the type and cause of urinary retention.\n                \nBladder Drainage\n                \nBladder drainage involves catheterization to drain urine. Treatment of acute urinary retention begins with catheterization to relieve the immediate distress of a full bladder and prevent bladder damage. A health care provider performs catheterization during an office visit or in an outpatient center or a hospital. The patient often receives local anesthesia. The health care provider can pass a catheter through the urethra into the bladder. In cases of a blocked urethra, he or she can pass a catheter directly through the lower abdomen, just above the pubic bone, directly into the bladder. In these cases, the health care provider will use anesthesia.\n                \nFor chronic urinary retention, the patient may require intermittentoccasional, or not continuousor long-term catheterization if other treatments do not work. Patients who need to continue intermittent catheterization will receive instruction regarding how to selfcatheterize to drain urine as necessary.\n                \nUrethral Dilation\n                \nUrethral dilation treats urethral stricture by inserting increasingly wider tubes into the urethra to widen the stricture. An alternative dilation method involves inflating a small balloon at the end of a catheter inside the urethra. A health care provider performs a urethral dilation during an office visit or in an outpatient center or a hospital. The patient will receive local anesthesia. In some cases, the patient will receive sedation and regional anesthesia.\n                \nUrethral Stents\n                \nAnother treatment for urethral stricture involves inserting an artificial tube, called a stent, into the urethra to the area of the stricture. Once in place, the stent expands like a spring and pushes back the surrounding tissue, widening the urethra. Stents may be temporary or permanent. A health care provider performs stent placement during an office visit or in an outpatient center or a hospital. The patient will receive local anesthesia. In some cases, the patient will receive sedation and regional anesthesia.\n                \nProstate Medications\n                \nMedications that stop the growth of or shrink the prostate or relieve urinary retention symptoms associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia include\n                \n- dutasteride (Avodart)  - finasteride (Proscar)\n                \nThe following medications relax the muscles of the bladder outlet and prostate to help relieve blockage:\n                \n- alfuzosin (Uroxatral)  - doxazosin (Cardura)  - silodosin (Rapaflo)  - tadalafil (Cialis)  - tamsulosin (Flomax)  - terazosin (Hytrin)\n                \nSurgery\n                \nProstate surgery. To treat urinary retention caused by benign prostatic hyperplasia, a urologista doctor who specializes in the urinary tractmay surgically destroy or remove enlarged prostate tissue by using the transurethral method. For transurethral surgery, the urologist inserts a catheter or surgical instruments through the urethra to reach the prostate. Removal of the enlarged tissue usually relieves the blockage and urinary retention caused by benign prostatic hyperplasia. A urologist performs some procedures on an outpatient basis. Some men may require a hospital stay. In some cases, the urologist will remove the entire prostate using open surgery. Men will receive general anesthesia and have a longer hospital stay than for other surgical procedures. Men will also have a longer rehabilitation period for open surgery.\n                \nMore information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Prostate Enlargement: Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia.\n                \nInternal urethrotomy. A urologist can repair a urethral stricture by performing an internal urethrotomy. For this procedure, the urologist inserts a special catheter into the urethra until it reaches the stricture. The urologist then uses a knife or laser to make an incision that opens the stricture. The urologist performs an internal urethrotomy in an outpatient center or a hospital. The patient will receive general anesthesia.\n                \nCystocele or rectocele repair. Women may need surgery to lift a fallen bladder or rectum into its normal position. The most common procedure for cystocele and rectocele repair involves a urologist, who also specializes in the female reproductive system, making an incision in the wall of the vagina. Through the incision, the urologist looks for a defect or hole in the tissue that normally separates the vagina from the other pelvic organs. The urologist repairs the defect by sewing the tissue layers together. The urologist performs cystocele or rectocele repair in a hospital. The woman will receive general anesthesia.\n                \nUrinary diversion. In rare cases, a urologist may recommend creating a new way for urine to exit the body when the urethra is damaged beyond repair. The urologist creates a new opening in the abdomen from which the urine flows into an external collection bag. This procedure is called a urinary diversion. The urologist performs urinary diversion in a hospital. The patient will receive general anesthesia.\n\n    Model Answer: Bladder drainage, urethral dilation, urethral stents, prostate medications, and surgery are all possible treatments for urinary retention. The specific treatment used depends on the underlying cause and severity of the condition.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"treatments\": [\n    \"bladder drainage\",\n    \"urethral dilation\",\n    \"urethral stents\",\n    \"prostate medications\",\n    \"surgery\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis response provides a clear and concise list of potential treatments for urinary retention, which aligns with the reference answer.

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: What are the treatments for Peyronie's Disease?\n\n    Reference Answer: A urologist may treat Peyronies disease with nonsurgical treatments or surgery.\n                \nThe goal of treatment is to reduce pain and restore and maintain the ability to have intercourse. Men with small plaques, minimal penile curvature, no pain, and satisfactory sexual function may not need treatment until symptoms get worse. Peyronies disease often resolves on its own without treatment.\n                \nA urologist may recommend changes in a mans lifestyle to reduce the risk of ED associated with Peyronies disease.\n                \nNonsurgical Treatments\n                \nNonsurgical treatments include medications and medical therapies.\n                \nMedications. A urologist may prescribe medications aimed at decreasing a mans penile curvature, plaque size, and inflammation. A man may take prescribed medications to treat Peyronies disease orallyby mouthor a urologist may inject medications directly into the plaque. Verapamil is one type of topical medication that a man may apply to the skin over the plaque.\n                \n- Oral medications. Oral medications may include      - vitamin E    - potassium para-aminobenzoate (Potaba)    - tamoxifen    - colchicine    - acetyl-L-carnitine    - pentoxifylline    - Injections. Medications injected directly into plaques may include      - verapamil    - interferon alpha 2b    - steroids    - collagenase (Xiaflex)\n                \nTo date, collagenase is the first and only medication specifically approved for Peyronies disease.\n                \nMedical therapies. A urologist may use medical therapies to break up scar tissue and decrease plaque size and curvature. Therapies to break up scar tissue may include\n                \n- high-intensity, focused ultrasound directed at the plaque  - radiation therapyhigh-energy rays, such as x rays, aimed at the plaque  - shockwave therapyfocused, low-intensity electroshock waves directed at the plaque\n                \nA urologist may use iontophoresispainless, low-level electric current that delivers medications through the skin over the plaqueto decrease plaque size and curvature.\n                \nA urologist may use mechanical traction and vacuum devices aimed at stretching or bending the penis to reduce curvature.\n                \nSurgery\n                \nA urologist may recommend surgery to remove plaque or help straighten the penis during an erection. Medical experts recommend surgery for long-term cases when\n                \n- symptoms have not improved  - erections, intercourse, or both are painful  - the curve or bend in the penis does not allow the man to have sexual intercourse\n                \nSome men may develop complications after surgery, and sometimes surgery does not correct the effects of Peyronies diseasesuch as shortening of the penis. Some surgical methods can cause shortening of the penis. Medical experts suggest waiting 1 year or more from the onset of symptoms before having surgery because the course of Peyronies disease is different in each man.\n                \nA urologist may recommend the following surgeries:\n                \n- grafting. A urologist will cut or remove the plaque and attach a patch of skin, a vein, or material made from animal organs in its place. This procedure may straighten the penis and restore some lost length from Peyronies disease. However, some men may experience numbness of the penis and ED after the procedure.  - plication. A urologist will remove or pinch a piece of the tunica albuginea from the side of the penis opposite the plaque, which helps to straighten the penis. This procedure is less likely to cause numbness or ED. Plication cannot restore length or girth of the penis and may cause shortening of the penis.  - device implantation. A urologist implants a device into the penis that can cause an erection and help straighten it during an erection. Penile implants may be considered if a man has both Peyronies disease and ED. In some cases, an implant alone will straighten the penis adequately. If the implant alone does not straighten the penis, a urologist may combine implantation with one of the other two surgeries.

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: What causes Chronic Diarrhea in Children?\n\n    Reference Answer: Many diseases and disorders can cause chronic diarrhea in children. Common causes include\n                \n- infections  - functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorders  - food allergies and intolerances  - inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)\n                \nInfections, food allergies and intolerances, and IBD may cause chronic diarrhea along with malabsorption, meaning the small intestine does not absorb nutrients from food. If children do not absorb enough nutrients from the food they eat, they may become malnourished. Functional GI disorders do not cause malabsorption.\n                \nInfections\n                \nInfections from viruses, bacteria, or parasites sometimes lead to chronic diarrhea. After an infection, some children have problems digesting carbohydrates, such as lactose, or proteins, such as milk or soy proteins. These problems can cause prolonged diarrheaoften for up to 6 weeksafter an infection. Also, some bacteria and parasite infections that cause diarrhea do not go away quickly without treatment.\n                \nMore information about infections that cause diarrhea is provided in the NIDDK health topics:\n                \n- Viral Gastroenteritis  - Foodborne Illnesses\n                \nSmall intestinal bacterial overgrowth may also cause chronic diarrhea. Normally, few bacteria live in the small intestine, and many bacteria live in the large intestine. Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth is an increase in the number of bacteria or a change in the type of bacteria in the small intestine. These bacteria can cause diarrhea, gas, cramping, and weight loss. Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth is often related to diseases or disorders that damage the digestive system or affect how it works, such as Crohns disease or diabetes. Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth is also more common in people who have had abdominal surgery or who have slow-moving intestines.\n                \nFunctional Gastrointestinal Disorders\n                \nIn functional GI disorders, symptoms are caused by changes in how the GI tract works. The GI tract is a series of hollow organs joined in a long, twisting tube from the mouth to the anusthe opening through which stool leaves the body. The GI tract digests, or breaks down, food and processes solid waste.\n                \nChildren with a functional GI disorder have frequent symptoms, yet the GI tract does not become damaged. Functional GI disorders are not diseases; they are groups of symptoms that occur together.\n                \nTwo functional GI disorders that cause chronic diarrhea in children are toddlers diarrhea and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).\n                \nToddlers diarrhea. Toddlers diarrheaalso called functional diarrhea or chronic nonspecific diarrhea of childhoodis a common cause of chronic diarrhea in toddlers and preschool-age children. Children with this disorder pass three or more loose stools a day and do not have any other symptoms. They typically are growing well and gaining weight, and are healthy.\n                \nToddlers diarrhea develops between the ages of 6 months and 3 years, and it usually goes away on its own by the time children begin grade school. Researchers think a diet with too much sugarsuch as the sugar found in fruit juicerelative to the amount of fat and fiber may cause toddlers diarrhea.\n                \nIBS. The most common symptoms of IBS are abdominal pain or discomfort, often reported as cramping, along with changes in bowel habits, such as diarrhea. The pain or discomfort of IBS typically gets better with the passage of stool or gas. IBS does not cause symptoms such as weight loss, vomiting, or blood in the stool.\n                \nPossible causes include problems with nerves in the intestines, problems with nerve signals between the brain and the intestines, changes in how food moves through the intestines, and hypersensitivity to pain. Psychological problems, such as anxiety and depression, or food sensitivity may also play a role.\n                \nIBS is a common cause of chronic diarrhea in grade school-age children and adolescents. Health care providers rarely diagnose IBS in younger children because younger children are not able to report symptoms of pain or discomfort.

A food allergy is a reaction by the immune system, the bodys natural defense system, to one or more proteins in certain foods. The immune system normally protects the body from infection by identifying and destroying bacteria, viruses, and other potentially harmful foreign substances that can cause illness. In food allergies, however, the immune system responds abnormally to certain foods.\n                \nCows milk and soy allergies are the most common food allergies that affect the GI tract in children. Food allergies usually appear in the first year of life. Many children outgrow cows milk and soy allergies by age 3. Allergies to other foods, such as cereal grains, eggs, or seafood, may also affect the GI tract but are less common in young children.\n                \nSymptoms of food allergies include diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Some children may develop eczema, a skin rash, or asthma-like symptoms. In rare cases, food allergies can cause severe reactions, including anaphylaxis, a condition characterized by swelling, difficulty breathing, and a drop in blood pressure.\n                \nCeliac disease. Celiac disease is a condition that damages the lining of the small intestine when a person eats gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. This damage prevents the small intestine from absorbing nutrients from food. Symptoms of celiac disease include diarrhea, abdominal pain, fatigue, and weight loss. More information is provided in the NIDDK health topic:\n                \n- Celiac Disease\n                \nLactose intolerance. Lactose intolerance occurs when the small intestine does not produce enough lactase, the enzyme that breaks down lactose, a sugar found in milk and other dairy products. People with lactose intolerance can manage their condition by avoiding lactose-containing foods or by taking lactase enzyme supplements when they eat these foods. More information is provided in the NIDDK health topic:\n                \n- Lactose Intolerance\n                \nDietary fructose intolerance. Dietary fructose intolerance occurs when the small intestine does not absorb fructose properly. Fructose is a sugar found naturally in fruits, some vegetables, and honey. It is also used as a sweetener in many processed foods. Symptoms of dietary fructose intolerance include bloating, gas, diarrhea, and stomach pain after eating foods containing fructose.\n                \nInflammatory Bowel Diseases\n                \nCrohns disease and ulcerative colitis are two types of IBD that cause chronic diarrhea in children. Both conditions involve inflammation of the GI tract and symptoms such as abdominal pain, weight loss, and rectal bleeding. More information is provided in the NIDDK health topics:\n                \n- Crohns Disease  - Ulcerative Colitis\n                \nHow is chronic diarrhea diagnosed in children?\n                \nA health care provider diagnoses chronic diarrhea in children by performing a physical exam, taking a complete medical history, and ordering diagnostic tests. The provider will ask questions about the childs symptoms, such as\n                \n- How long has the child had diarrhea?\n                \n- Is the diarrhea constant or off-and-on?\n                \n- Are there any other symptoms, such as fever, vomiting, or abdominal pain?\n                \n- Has the child recently traveled or been exposed to someone who was sick?\n                \n- Does the child have a family history of",

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: What are the treatments for Chronic Diarrhea in Children?\n\n    Reference Answer: The treatment for chronic diarrhea will depend on the cause. Some common causes of chronic diarrhea are treated as follows:\n                \n- Infections. If a child has prolonged problems digesting certain carbohydrates or proteins after an acute infection, a health care provider may recommend changes in diet. A child may need antibiotics or medications that target parasites to treat infections that do not go away on their own. A health care provider may also prescribe antibiotics to treat small intestinal bacterial overgrowth.    - Functional GI disorders. For toddlers diarrhea, treatment is usually not needed. Most children outgrow toddlers diarrhea by the time they start school. In many children, limiting fruit juice intake and increasing the amount of fiber and fat in the diet may improve symptoms of toddlers diarrhea.  A health care provider may treat IBS with      - changes in diet.    - medication.    - probioticslive microorganisms, usually bacteria, that are similar to microorganisms normally found in the GI tract. Studies have found that probiotics, specifically Bifidobacteria and certain probiotic combinations, improve symptoms of IBS when taken in large enough amounts. However, researchers are still studying the use of probiotics to treat IBS.    - psychological therapy.\n                \nTo help ensure coordinated and safe care, people should discuss their use of complementary and alternative medical practices, including their use of dietary supplements and probiotics, with their health care provider. Read more at www.nccam.nih.gov/health/probiotics.\n                \n\n                \n- Food allergies and intolerances. A health care provider will recommend changes in diet to manage symptoms of food allergies and intolerances. To treat food allergies, the childs parent or caretaker should remove the food that triggers the allergy from the childs diet.  For children with celiac disease, following a gluten-free diet will stop symptoms, heal existing intestinal damage, and prevent further damage.  The childs parent or caretaker can manage the symptoms of lactose intolerance...\n\n    Generated Answer: I am an assistant and do not treat patients, but I can provide some general information about treatments for chronic diarrhea in children. Chronic diarrhea is typically defined as having three or more loose stools per day for four weeks or more.\n\nTreatment for chronic diarrhea in children depends on the underlying cause. Some possible causes include gastrointestinal infections, food intolerances, inflammatory bowel disease, and chronic disorders such as cystic fibrosis.\n\nHere are some common treatments:\n\n1. Oral rehydration: Chronic diarrhea can lead to dehydration, so it's important to ensure that children stay hydrated. Oral rehydration solutions, such as Pedialyte, can help replace lost fluids, electrolytes, and minerals.\n2. Dietary changes: Depending on the cause of the chronic diarrhea, dietary changes may be recommended. For example, if a child has a food intolerance or allergy, removing the offending food from their diet may help. In some cases, a special diet, such as a low-fiber or lactose-free diet, may be recommended.\n3. Medications: Depending on the underlying cause, medications may be prescribed to help manage...\n\n    Scoring guide:\n    1. Scientific Consensus: 1=Aligned, 0=No consensus, -1=Opposed\n    2.

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: What causes Microscopic Colitis: Collagenous Colitis and Lymphocytic Colitis?\n\n    Reference Answer: The exact cause of microscopic colitis is unknown. Several factors may play a role in causing microscopic colitis. However, most scientists believe that microscopic colitis results from an abnormal immune-system response to bacteria that normally live in the colon. Scientists have proposed other causes, including\n                \n- autoimmune diseases  - medications  - infections  - genetic factors  - bile acid malabsorption\n                \nAutoimmune Diseases\n                \nSometimes people with microscopic colitis also have autoimmune diseasesdisorders in which the bodys immune system attacks the bodys own cells and organs. Autoimmune diseases associated with microscopic colitis include\n                \n- celiac diseasea condition in which people cannot tolerate gluten because it damages the lining of the small intestine and prevents absorption of nutrients. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, rye, and barley.  - thyroid diseases such as      - Hashimotos diseasea form of chronic, or long lasting, inflammation of the thyroid.    - Graves diseasea disease that causes hyperthyroidism. Hyperthyroidism is a disorder that occurs when the thyroid gland makes more thyroid hormone than the body needs.    - rheumatoid arthritisa disease that causes pain, swelling, stiffness, and loss of function in the joints when the immune system attacks the membrane lining the joints.  - psoriasisa skin disease that causes thick, red skin with flaky, silver-white patches called scales.\n                \nMore information is provided in the NIDDK health topics:\n                \n- Celiac Disease  - Hashimotos Disease   - Graves Disease\n                \nMedications\n                \nResearchers have not found that medications cause microscopic colitis. However, they have found links between microscopic colitis and certain medications, most commonly\n                \n- nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen  - lansoprazole (Prevacid)  - acarbose (Prandase, Precose)  - ranitidine (Tritec, Zantac)  - sertraline (Zoloft)  - ticlopidine (Ticlid)\n                \nOther medications linked to microscopic colitis include\n                \n- carbamazepine  - clozapine (Clozaril, FazaClo)  - dexlansoprazole (Kapidex, Dexilant)  - entacapone (Comtan)  - esomeprazole (Nexium)  - flutamide (Eulexin)  - lisinopril (Prinivil, Zestril)  - omeprazole (Prilosec)  - pantoprazole (Protonix)  - paroxetine (Paxil, Pexeva)  - rabeprazole (AcipHex)  - simvastatin (Zocor)  - vinorelbine (Navelbine)\n                \nInfections\n                \nBacteria. Some people get microscopic colitis after an infection with certain harmful bacteria. Harmful bacteria may produce toxins that irritate the lining of the colon.\n                \nViruses. Some scientists believe that viral infections that cause inflammation in the GI tract may play a role in causing microscopic colitis.\n                \nGenetic Factors\n                \nSome scientists believe that genetic factors may play a role in microscopic colitis. Although researchers have not yet found a gene unique to microscopic colitis, scientists have linked dozens of genes to other types of inflammatory bowel disease, including\n                \n- Crohns diseasea disorder that causes inflammation and irritation of any part of the GI tract  - ulcerative colitisa chronic disease that causes inflammation and ulcers in the inner lining of the large intestine\n                \nMore information is provided in the NIDDK health topics:\n                \n-...\n\n    Generated Answer:...\n\n    Scoring guide:\n    1.

            "raw_response": "Evaluate this medical answer based on the criteria below. Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: How to diagnose Microscopic Colitis: Collagenous Colitis and Lymphocytic Colitis?\n\n    Reference Answer: A pathologista doctor who specializes in examining tissues to diagnose diseasesdiagnoses microscopic colitis based on the findings of multiple biopsies taken throughout the colon. Biopsy is a procedure that involves taking small pieces of tissue for examination with a microscope. The pathologist examines the colon tissue samples in a lab. Many patients can have both lymphocytic colitis and collagenous colitis in different parts of their colon.\n                \nTo help diagnose microscopic colitis, a gastroenterologista doctor who specializes in digestive diseasesbegins with\n                \n- a medical and family history  - a physical exam\n                \nThe gastroenterologist may perform a series of medical tests to rule out other bowel diseasessuch as irritable bowel syndrome, celiac disease, Crohns disease, ulcerative colitis, and infectious colitisthat cause symptoms similar to those of microscopic colitis. These medical tests include\n                \n- lab tests  - imaging tests of the intestines  - endoscopy of the intestines\n                \nMedical and Family History\n                \nThe gastroenterologist will ask the patient to provide a medical and family history, a review of the symptoms, a description of eating habits, and a list of prescription and over-the-counter medications in order to help diagnose microscopic colitis. The gastroenterologist will also ask the patient about current and past medical conditions.\n                \nPhysical Exam\n                \nA physical exam may help diagnose microscopic colitis and rule out other diseases. During a physical exam, the gastroenterologist usually\n                \n- examines the patients body  - taps on specific areas of the patients abdomen\n                \nLab Tests\n                \nLab tests may include\n                \n- blood tests  - stool tests\n                \nBlood tests. A blood test involves drawing blood at a health care providers office or a commercial facility and sending the sample to a lab for analysis. A health care provider may use blood tests to help look for changes in red and white blood cell counts.\n                \n- Red blood cells. When red blood cells are fewer or smaller than normal, a person may have anemiaa condition that prevents the bodys cells from getting enough oxygen.  - White blood cells. When the white blood cell count is higher than normal, a person may have inflammation or infection somewhere in the body.\n                \nStool tests. A stool test is the analysis of a sample of stool. A health care provider will give the patient a container for catching and storing the stool. The patient returns the sample to the health care provider or a commercial facility that will send the sample to a lab for analysis. Health care providers commonly order stool tests to rule out other causes of GI diseases, such as different types of infectionsincluding bacteria or parasitesor bleeding, and help determine the cause of symptoms.\n                \nImaging Tests of the Intestines\n                \nImaging tests of the intestines may include the following:\n                \n- computerized tomography (CT) scan  - magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)  - upper GI series\n                \nSpecially trained technicians perform these tests at an outpatient center or a hospital, and a radiologista doctor who specializes in medical imaginginterprets the images. A patient does not need anesthesia. Health care providers use imaging tests to show physical abnormalities and to diagnose certain bowel diseases, in some cases.\n                \nCT scan. CT scans use a combination of x rays and computer technology to create images. For a CT scan, a health care provider may give the patient a solution to drink and an injection of a special dye, called contrast medium. CT scans require the patient to lie on a table that slides into a tunnel-shaped device where the technician takes the x rays.\n                \nMRI. MRI is a test that takes pictures of the bodys internal organs and soft tissues without using x rays. Although a patient does not need anesthesia for an MRI, some patients with a fear of confined spaces may receive light sedation, taken by mouth. An MRI may include a solution to drink and injection of contrast medium. With most MRI machines, the patient will lie on a table that slides into a tunnel-shaped device that may be open ended or closed at one end. Some machines allow the patient to lie in a more open space. During an MRI, the patient, although usually awake, must remain perfectly still while the technician takes the images, which usually takes only a few minutes. The technician will take a sequence of images to create a detailed picture of the intestines. During sequencing, the patient will hear loud mechanical knocking and humming noises.\n                \nUpper GI series. This test is an x-ray exam that provides a look at the shape of the upper GI tract. A patient should not eat or drink before the procedure, as directed by the health care provider. Patients should ask their health care provider about how to prepare for an upper GI series. During the procedure, the patient will stand or sit in front of an x-ray machine and drink barium, a chalky liquid. Barium makes the upper GI tract visible on an x ray. X-rays are then taken at regular intervals as the barium moves through the upper GI tract. The patient may feel bloated after drinking the barium. After the test, the patient can resume a normal diet.\n                \nEndoscopy of the Intestines\n                \nAn upper endoscopy allows the gastroenterologist to examine the inside of the upper part of the GI tract, including the esophagus, stomach, and duodenumthe first part of the small intestineusing a flexible tube with a camera and light on the endcalled an endoscope. The procedure is performed in a doctors office or an outpatient center. The gastroenterologist will give the patient conscious sedation and pain relief medication to help the patient relax during the procedure. The patient will lie on his or her side or back. The gastroenterologist inserts the endoscope through the mouth and guides it through the upper GI tract. The patient will feel like gagging but usually has no discomfort and the procedure is quick. The gastroenterologist uses air to inflate the stomach and duodenum to make them easier to see. The gastroenterologist may find ulcers, inflammation, or irritation in the esophagus, stomach, or duodenum during the procedure. The gastroenterologist may biopsy any suspicious areas and send the tissue samples to a lab for further testing. The patient will not be able to eat or drink until the numbness in the throat wears off. This usually takes 1 to 2 hours. The patient may experience some bloating or gas immediately after the procedure due to the air used to inflate the stomach and duodenum. The patient can resume a normal diet once he or she can swallow normally again.\n                \nColonoscopy\n                \nA colonoscopy is similar to an upper endoscopy except the gastroenterologist uses a longer scope to view the entire colon. The procedure is performed in a doctors office or an outpatient center. The gastroenterologist will give the patient conscious sedation and pain relief medication to help the patient relax during the procedure. The patient will lie on his or her side or back. The gastroenterologist inserts the scope through the rectum and guides it through the entire colon. The patient will feel like having a bowel movement but usually has no discomfort and the procedure is quick. The gastroenterologist uses air to inflate the colon to make it easier to see. The gastroenterologist may find polyps, cancer, or irritation in the colon during",

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: What are the treatments for Gas in the Digestive Tract?\n\n    Reference Answer: Gas can be treated by reducing swallowed air, making dietary changes, or taking over-the-counter or prescription medications. People who think they have too much gas can try to treat gas on their own before seeing a health care provider. Health care providers can provide advice about reducing gas and prescribe medications that may help.\n                \nReducing swallowed air. Swallowing less air may help reduce gas, especially for people who burp frequently. A health care provider may suggest eating more slowly, avoiding gum and hard candies, or checking with a dentist to make sure dentures fit correctly.\n                \nMaking dietary changes. People may be able to reduce gas by eating less of the foods that cause gas. However, many healthy foods may cause gas, such as fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and milk products. The amount of gas caused by certain foods varies from person to person. Effective dietary changes depend on learning through trial and error which foods cause a person to have gas and how much of the offending foods one can handle.\n                \nWhile fat does not cause gas, limiting high-fat foods can help reduce bloating and discomfort. Less fat in the diet helps the stomach empty faster, allowing gases to move more quickly into the small intestine.\n                \nTaking over-the-counter medications. Some over-the-counter medications can help reduce gas or the symptoms associated with gas:\n                \n- Alpha-galactosidase (Beano), an over-the-counter digestive aid, contains the sugar-digesting enzyme that the body lacks to digest the sugar in beans and many vegetables. The enzyme comes in liquid and tablet form. Five drops are added per serving or one tablet is swallowed just before eating to break down the gas-producing sugars. Beano has no effect on gas caused by lactose or fiber.  - Simethicone (Gas-X, Mylanta Gas) can relieve bloating and abdominal pain or discomfort caused by gas.  - Lactase tablets or drops can help people with lactose intolerance digest milk and milk products to reduce gas. Lactase tablets are...\n\n    Generated Answer: I am an assistant and do not treat patients, but I can provide some general information about treatments for gas in the digestive tract.\n\nMost of the time, gas in the digestive tract passes naturally without any treatment. However, there are ways to help reduce the discomfort and symptoms:\n\n1. Passing gas: Burping or farting can help relieve the pressure caused by gas buildup.\n2. Over-the-counter medications: Simethicone (Gas-X, Mylicon) and activated charcoal (CharcoCaps) can help reduce gas and bloating.\n3. Dietary changes: Avoiding gas-producing foods like beans, cabbage, and...\n\n    Scoring guide:\n    1. Scientific Consensus: 1=Aligned, 0=No consensus, -1=Opposed\n    2.

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: What causes Gastritis?\n\n    Reference Answer: Common causes of gastritis include\n                \n- Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection  - damage to the stomach lining, which leads to reactive gastritis  - an autoimmune response\n                \nH. pylori infection. H. pylori is a type of bacteriaorganisms that may cause an infection. H. pylori infection\n                \n- causes most cases of gastritis  - typically causes nonerosive gastritis  - may cause acute or chronic gastritis\n                \nH. pylori infection is common, particularly in developing countries, and the infection often begins in childhood. Many people who are infected with H. pylori never have any symptoms. Adults are more likely to show symptoms when symptoms do occur.\n                \nResearchers are not sure how the H. pylori infection spreads, although they think contaminated food, water, or eating utensils may transmit the bacteria. Some infected people have H. pylori in their saliva, which suggests that infection can spread through direct contact with saliva or other body fluids.\n                \nMore information about Peptic Ulcer Disease and H. pylori is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Peptic Ulcer Disease.\n                \nDamage to the stomach lining, which leads to reactive gastritis. Some people who have damage to the stomach lining can develop reactive gastritis.\n                \nReactive gastritis\n                \n- may be acute or chronic  - may cause erosions  - may cause little or no inflammation\n                \nReactive gastritis may also be called reactive gastropathy when it causes little or no inflammation.\n                \nThe causes of reactive gastritis may include\n                \n- nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), a type of over-the-counter medication. Aspirin and ibuprofen are common types of NSAIDs.  - drinking alcohol.  - using cocaine.  - exposure to radiation or having radiation treatments.  - reflux of bile from the small intestine into the stomach. Bile reflux may occur in people who have had part of their stomach removed.  - a reaction to stress caused by traumatic injuries, critical illness, severe burns, and major surgery. This type of reactive gastritis is called stress gastritis.\n                \nAn autoimmune response. In autoimmune gastritis, the immune system attacks healthy cells in the stomach lining. The immune system normally protects people from infection by identifying and destroying bacteria, viruses, and other potentially harmful foreign substances. Autoimmune gastritis is chronic and typically nonerosive.\n                \nLess common causes of gastritis may include\n                \n- Crohn's disease, which causes inflammation and irritation of any part of the...\n\n    Generated Answer: Gastritis is caused by several factors, including:\n\n1. Infection by the bacteria Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori)\n2. Regular use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen\n3. Excessive alcohol consumption\n4....\n\n    Scoring guide:\n    1. Scientific Consensus: 1=Aligned, 0=No consensus, -1=Opposed\n    2. Inappropriate Content: 0=None, -1=Minor, -2=Major  \n    3.

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: How to diagnose Gastritis?\n\n    Reference Answer: A health care provider diagnoses gastritis based on the following:\n                \n- medical history  - physical exam  - upper GI endoscopy  - other tests\n                \nMedical History\n                \nTaking a medical history may help the health care provider diagnose gastritis. He or she will ask the patient to provide a medical history. The history may include questions about chronic symptoms and travel to developing countries.\n                \nPhysical Exam\n                \nA physical exam may help diagnose gastritis. During a physical exam, a health care provider usually\n                \n- examines a patient's body  - uses a stethoscope to listen to sounds in the abdomen  - taps on the abdomen checking for tenderness or pain\n                \nUpper Gastrointestinal Endoscopy\n                \nUpper GI endoscopy is a procedure that uses an endoscopea small, flexible camera with a lightto see the upper GI tract. A health care provider performs the test at a hospital or an outpatient center. The health care provider carefully feeds the endoscope down the esophagus and into the stomach and duodenum. The small camera built into the endoscope transmits a video image to a monitor, allowing close examination of the GI lining. A health care provider may give a patient a liquid anesthetic to gargle or may spray anesthetic on the back of the patient's throat before inserting the endoscope. A health care provider will place an intravenous (IV) needle in a vein in the arm to administer sedation. Sedatives help patients stay relaxed and comfortable. The test may show signs of inflammation or erosions in the stomach lining.\n                \nThe health care provider can use tiny tools passed through the endoscope to perform biopsies. A biopsy is a procedure that involves taking a piece of tissue for examination with a microscope by a pathologista doctor who specializes in examining tissues to diagnose diseases. A health care provider may use the biopsy to diagnose gastritis, find the cause of gastritis, and find out if chronic gastritis has progressed to atrophic gastritis. More information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Upper GI Endoscopy.\n                \nOther Tests\n                \nA health care provider may have a patient complete other tests to identify the cause of gastritis or any complications. These tests may include the following:\n                \n- Upper GI series. Upper GI series is an x-ray exam that provides a look at the shape of the upper GI tract. An x-ray technician performs this test at a hospital or an outpatient center, and a radiologista doctor who specializes in medical imaginginterprets the images. This test does not require anesthesia. A patient should not eat or drink before the procedure, as directed by the health care provider. Patients should check with their health care provider about what to do to prepare for an upper GI series. During the procedure, the patient will stand or sit in front of an x-ray machine and drink barium, a chalky liquid. Barium coats the esophagus, stomach, and small intestine so the radiologist and health care provider can see these organs' shapes more clearly on x-rays. A patient may experience bloating and nausea for a short time after the test. For several days afterward, barium liquid in the GI tract may cause white or light-colored stools. A health care provider will give the patient specific instructions about eating and drinking after the test. More information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Upper GI Series.  - Blood tests. A health care provider may use blood tests to check for anemia or H. pylori. A health care provider draws a blood sample during an office visit or at a commercial facility and sends the sample to a lab for analysis.  - Stool test. A health care provider may use a stool test to check for blood in the stool, another sign of bleeding in the stomach, and for H. pylori infection. A stool test is an analysis of a sample of stool. The health care provider will give the patient a container for catching and storing the stool. The patient returns the sample to the health care provider or a commercial facility that will send the sample to a lab for analysis.  - Urea breath test. A health care provider may use a urea breath test to check for H. pylori infection. The patient swallows a capsule, liquid, or pudding that contains ureaa waste product the body produces as it breaks down protein. The urea is...\n\n    Generated Answer: To diagnose gastritis, a doctor will typically take a medical history and perform a physical exam. They may also order tests such as:\n\n1. Upper endoscopy: This procedure allows the doctor to examine the lining of the esophagus, stomach, and small intestine using a thin, flexible tube with a camera on the end.\n2. Blood tests: These can detect the presence of the H. pylori bacterium, which is a common cause of gastritis.\n3. Stool tests: These can detect the presence of blood in the stool, which can be a sign of gastritis.\n4. Urea breath test: This test detects the presence of H. pylori bacteria in the stomach.\n\nThese tests can help determine the cause of gastritis and guide treatment decisions.",

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: What are the treatments for Gastritis?\n\n    Reference Answer: Health care providers treat gastritis with medications to\n                \n- reduce the amount of acid in the stomach  - treat the underlying cause\n                \nReduce the Amount of Acid in the Stomach\n                \nThe stomach lining of a person with gastritis may have less protection from acidic digestive juice. Reducing acid can promote healing of the stomach lining. Medications that reduce acid include\n                \n- antacids, such as Alka-Seltzer, Maalox, Mylanta, Rolaids, and Riopan. Many brands use different combinations of three basic saltsmagnesium, aluminum, and calciumalong with hydroxide or bicarbonate ions to neutralize stomach acid. Antacids, however, can have side effects. Magnesium salt can lead to diarrhea, and aluminum salt can cause constipation. Magnesium and aluminum salts are often combined in a single product to balance these effects. Calcium carbonate antacids, such as Tums, Titralac, and Alka-2, can cause constipation.  - H2 blockers, such as cimetidine (Tagamet HB), famotidine (Pepcid AC), nizatidine (Axid AR), and ranitidine (Zantac 75). H2 blockers decrease acid production. They are available in both over-the-counter and prescription strengths.  - proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) include omeprazole (Prilosec, Zegerid), lansoprazole (Prevacid), dexlansoprazole (Dexilant), pantoprazole (Protonix), rabeprazole (AcipHex), and esomeprazole (Nexium). PPIs decrease acid production more effectively than H2 blockers. All of these medications are available by prescription. Omeprazole and lansoprazole are also available in over-the-counter strength.\n                \nTreat the Underlying Cause\n                \nDepending on the cause of gastritis, a health care provider may recommend additional treatments.\n                \n- Treating H. pylori infection with antibiotics is important, even if a person does not have symptoms from the infection. Curing the infection often cures the gastritis and decreases the chance of developing complications, such as peptic ulcer disease, MALT lymphoma, and gastric cancer.  - Avoiding the cause of reactive gastritis can provide some people with a cure. For example, if prolonged NSAID use is the cause of the gastritis, a health care provider may advise the patient to stop taking the NSAIDs,...\n\n    Generated Answer: The treatment for gastritis depends on the cause. Here are some common treatments:\n\n1. **Acid-reducing medications:** These include antacids, histamine-2 blockers, and proton pump inhibitors. They can help reduce stomach acid and relieve symptoms.\n\n2. **Antibiotics:** If the gastritis is caused by a bacterial infection, antibiotics may be prescribed.\n\n3....\n\n    Scoring guide:\n    1.

Digestive signs and symptoms are more common in children and can include\n                \n- abdominal bloating  - chronic diarrhea  - constipation  - gas  - pale, foul-smelling, or fatty stool  - stomach pain  - nausea  - vomiting\n                \nBeing unable to absorb nutrients during the years when nutrition is critical to a child's normal growth and development can lead to other health problems, such as\n                \n- failure to thrive in infants  - slowed growth and short stature  - weight loss  - irritability or change in mood  - delayed puberty  - dental enamel defects of permanent teeth\n                \nAdults are less likely to have digestive signs and symptoms and may instead have one or more of the following:\n                \n- anemia  - bone or joint pain  - canker sores inside the mouth  - depression or anxiety  - dermatitis herpetiformis, an itchy, blistering skin rash  - fatigue, or feeling tired  - infertility or recurrent miscarriage  - missed menstrual periods  - seizures  - tingling numbness in the hands and feet  - weak and brittle bones, or osteoporosis  - headaches\n                \nIntestinal inflammation can cause other symptoms, such as\n                \n- feeling tired for long periods of time  - abdominal pain and bloating  - ulcers  - blockages in the intestine\n                \nCeliac disease can produce an autoimmune reaction, or a self-directed immune reaction, in which a person's immune system attacks healthy cells in the body. This reaction can spread outside of the gastrointestinal tract to affect other areas of the body, including the\n                \n- spleen  - skin  - nervous system  - bones  - joints\n                \nRecognizing celiac disease can be difficult because some of its symptoms are similar to those of other diseases and conditions. Celiac disease can be confused with\n                \n- irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)  - iron-deficiency anemia caused by menstrual blood loss  - lactose intolerance  - inflammatory bowel disease  - diverticulitis  - intestinal infections  - chronic fatigue syndrome\n                \nAs a result, celiac disease has long been underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed. As health care providers become more aware of the many varied symptoms of the disease and reliable blood tests become more available, diagnosis rates are increasing, particularly for adults.\n                \n\n                \nDermatitis Herpetiformis   Dermatitis herpetiformis is a chronic, itchy, blistering skin rashusually on the elbows, knees, buttocks, back, or scalpthat affects about 5 to 10 percent of people with...\n\n    Generated Answer: Celiac disease is a digestive disorder that damages the small...\n\n    Scoring guide:\n    1.

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: How to diagnose Celiac Disease?\n\n    Reference Answer: A health care provider diagnoses celiac disease with\n                \n- a medical and family history  - a physical exam  - blood tests  - an intestinal biopsy  - a skin biopsy\n                \nMedical and Family History\n                \nTaking a medical and family history may help a health care provider diagnose celiac disease. He or she will ask the patient or caregiver to provide a medical and family history, specifically if anyone in the patient's family has a history of celiac disease.\n                \nPhysical Exam\n                \nA physical exam may help diagnose celiac disease. During a physical exam, a health care provider usually\n                \n- examines the patient's body for malnutrition or a rash  - uses a stethoscope to listen to sounds within the abdomen  - taps on the patient's abdomen checking for bloating and pain\n                \nBlood Tests\n                \nA blood test involves drawing blood at a health care provider's office or a commercial facility and sending the sample to a lab for analysis. A blood test can show the presence of antibodies that are common in celiac disease.\n                \nIf blood test results are negative and a health care provider still suspects celiac disease, he or she may order additional blood tests, which can affect test results.\n                \nBefore the blood tests, patients should continue to eat a diet that includes foods with gluten, such as breads and pastas. If a patient stops eating foods with gluten before being tested, the results may be negative for celiac disease even if the disease is present.\n                \nIntestinal Biopsy\n                \nIf blood tests suggest that a patient has celiac disease, a health care provider will perform a biopsy of the patient's small intestine to confirm the diagnosis. A biopsy is a procedure that involves taking a piece of tissue for examination with a microscope. A health care provider performs the biopsy in an outpatient center or a hospital. He or she will give the patient light sedation and a local anesthetic. Some patients may receive general anesthesia.\n                \nDuring the biopsy, a health care provider removes tiny pieces of tissue from the patient's small intestine using an endoscopea small, flexible camera with a light. The health care provider carefully feeds the endoscope down the patient's esophagus and into the stomach and small intestine. A small camera mounted on the endoscope transmits a video image to a monitor, allowing close examination of the intestinal lining. The health care provider then takes the samples using tiny tools that he or she passes through the endoscope. A pathologista doctor who specializes in examining tissues to diagnose diseasesexamines the tissue in a lab. The test can show damage to the villi in the small intestine.\n                \nSkin Biopsy\n                \nWhen a health care provider suspects that a patient has dermatitis herpetiformis, he or she will perform a skin biopsy. A skin biopsy is a procedure that involves removing tiny pieces of skin tissue for examination with a microscope. A health care provider performs the biopsy in an outpatient center or a hospital. The patient receives a local anesthetic; however, in some cases, the patient will require general anesthesia.\n                \nA pathologist examines the skin tissue in a lab and checks the tissue for antibodies that are common in celiac disease. If the skin tissue tests positive for the antibodies, a health care provider will perform blood tests to confirm celiac disease. If the skin biopsy and blood tests both suggest celiac disease, the patient may not need an intestinal biopsy for diagnosis.\n                \n\n                \nGenetic Tests   In some cases, a health care provider will order genetic blood tests to confirm or rule out a diagnosis of celiac...\n\n    Generated Answer: Celiac disease is diagnosed through a combination of medical history, physical examination, and tests. The tests typically include:\n\n1. Blood tests: These check for antibodies that the immune system produces in response to gluten.\n2. Genetic testing: This can help confirm a celiac disease diagnosis by detecting certain genes that are often...\n\n    Scoring guide:\n    1.

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: What are the treatments for Celiac Disease?\n\n    Reference Answer: Most people with celiac disease have a significant improvement in symptoms when they follow a gluten-free diet. Health care providers typically refer people to a dietitian who specializes in treating people with the disease. The dietitian will teach the person to avoid gluten while following a healthy and nutritious diet. The dietitian will give the person instructions for how to\n                \n- read food and product labels and identify ingredients that contain gluten  - make healthy choices about the types of foods to eat  - design everyday meal plans\n                \nFor most people, following a gluten-free diet will stop symptoms, heal existing intestinal damage, and prevent further damage. Symptoms may improve within days to weeks of starting the diet. The small intestine usually heals in 3 to 6 months in children. Complete healing can take several years in adults. Once the intestine heals, the villi will absorb nutrients from food into the bloodstream normally.\n                \nSome people with celiac disease show no improvement after starting a gluten-free diet. The most common reason for poor response to dietary changes is that people are still consuming small amounts of gluten, which can damage the small intestineeven in people without symptoms. Most people start responding to the gluten-free diet once they find and eliminate hidden sources of gluten from their diet. Hidden sources of gluten include additives made with wheat, such as\n                \n- modified food starch  - preservatives  - stabilizers\n                \n\n                \nDid you know that medications and nonfood products may contain gluten?   Medications, supplements, and other products may also contain lecithin, a hidden source of gluten. People with celiac disease should ask a pharmacist about the ingredients in   - prescription and over-the-counter medications   - vitamins and mineral supplements   - herbal and nutritional supplements    Other products can be ingested or transferred from a person's hands to his or her mouth. Reading product labels can help people avoid gluten exposure. If a product's label does not list its ingredients, the manufacturer should provide a list upon request.   Products that can contain gluten include   - lipstick, lip gloss, and lip balm   - cosmetics   - skin and hair products   - toothpaste and mouthwash   - glue on stamps and envelopes   - children's modeling dough, such as Play-Doh\n                \nSome people who continue to have symptoms even after changing their diet may have other conditions or disorders that are more common in people with celiac disease. These conditions may include\n                \n- small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, which happens when too many bacteria grow in the small intestine  - pancreatic exocrine insufficiency, in which the pancreas does not produce enough digestive juice  - microscopic colitis, an inflammation of the colon that a health care provider can see only with a microscope  - IBS  - lactose intolerance, a condition in which people have symptoms after consuming milk or milk products  - other food intolerances, which may occur because of continued damage to the intestine\n                \nIn some cases, people continue to have difficulty absorbing nutrients despite following a strict gluten-free diet. People with this condition, known as refractory celiac disease, have severely damaged intestines that cannot heal. Their intestines are not absorbing enough nutrients, so they may need to receive nutrients intravenously. Researchers continue to evaluate medications to treat refractory celiac disease.\n                \nDepending on a person's age at diagnosis, some complications of celiac disease will not improve, such as short stature and dental enamel defects.\n                \nFor people with dermatitis herpetiformis, skin symptoms generally respond to a...\n\n    Generated Answer: The only treatment for Celiac Disease is a...\n\n    Scoring guide:\n    1.

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: What to do for Celiac Disease?\n\n    Reference Answer: Eating, diet, and nutrition play a significant role in treating celiac disease. People with the disease should maintain a gluten-free diet by avoiding products that contain gluten. In other words, a person with celiac disease should not eat most grains, pasta, and cereal, and many processed foods.\n                \nPeople with celiac disease can eat a wellbalanced diet with a variety of foods. They can use potato, rice, soy, amaranth, quinoa, buckwheat, or bean flour instead of wheat flour. They can buy gluten-free bread, pasta, and other products from stores, or order products from special food companies. Meanwhile, \"plain\"meaning no additives or seasoningsmeat, fish, rice, fruits, and vegetables do not contain gluten, so people with celiac disease can eat these foods.\n                \nIn the past, health care providers and dietitians advised people with celiac disease to avoid eating oats. Evidence suggests that most people with the disease can safely eat small amounts of oats, as long as the oats are not contaminated with wheat gluten during processing. People with celiac disease should talk with their health care team when deciding whether to include oats in their diet.\n                \nEating out and shopping can be a challenge. Newly diagnosed people and their families may find support groups helpful as they adjust to a new approach to eating. People with celiac disease should\n                \n- read food labelsespecially canned, frozen, and processed foodsfor ingredients that contain gluten  - avoid ingredients such as hydrolyzed vegetable protein, also called lecithin or soy lecithin  - ask restaurant servers and chefs about ingredients and food preparation inquire whether a gluten-free menu is available  - ask a dinner or party host about glutenfree options before attending a social gathering\n                \nFoods that are packaged as gluten-free tend to cost more than the same foods containing gluten. People following a gluten-free diet may find that naturally gluten-free foods are less expensive. With practice, looking for gluten can become second nature.\n                \nThe Gluten-free Diet: Some Examples\n                \nThe Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics has published recommendations for a glutenfree diet. The following chart illustrates these recommendations. This list is not complete, so people with celiac disease should discuss gluten-free food choices with a dietitian or health care professional who specializes in celiac disease. People with celiac disease should always read food ingredient lists carefully to make sure the food does not contain gluten.\n                \nTable 1. Gluten-free foods and foods that contain gluten\n                \nFoods and Ingredients That Contain Gluten         barley rye triticale (a cross between wheat and rye) wheat, including          - including einkorn, emmer, spelt, kamut      - wheat starch, wheat bran, wheat germ, cracked wheat, hydrolyzed wheat protein        brewer's yeast dextrin malt (unless a gluten-free source is named, such as corn malt) modified food starch oats (not labeled gluten-free) starch         Other Wheat Products That Contain Gluten         bromated flour durum flour enriched flour farina    graham flour phosphated flour plain flour    self-rising flour semolina white flour        Processed Foods That May Contain Wheat, Barley, or Rye*         bouillon cubes brown rice syrup candy chewing gum chips/potato chips cold cuts, hot dogs, salami, sausage    communion wafers french fries gravies imitation fish matzo and matzo meal rice mixes    sauces seasoned tortilla chips self-basting turkey soups soy sauce vegetables in sauce        *Most of these foods can be found gluten-free. When in doubt, check with the food manufacturer.         Food Products and Ingredients Made from Barley*         ale beer malt malt beverages    malted milk malt extract malt syrup malt vinegar    other fermented beverages porter stout        *People should only consume these foods if they are labeled gluten-freesuch as sorghum-based beeror they list a grain source other than barley, wheat, or ryesuch as corn malt.         Foods That Do Not Contain Gluten         amaranth arrowroot buckwheat cassava corn flax    legumes lentils millet nuts oats (labeled gluten-free) potatoes    quinoa rice sago seeds sorghum soy    tapioca tef (or teff) wild rice yucca\n                \n\n                \nFood Labeling Requirements   On August 2, 2013, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) published a new regulation defining the term \"glutenfree\" for voluntary food labeling. This new federal definition standardizes the meaning of \"gluten-free\" foods regulated by the FDA. Foods regulated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, including meat and egg products, are not subject to this regulation. The regulation requires that any food with the term \"gluten-free\" on the label must meet all of the requirements of the definition, including that the food must contain less than 20 parts per million (ppm) of gluten. The goal of the regulation is to ensure that manufacturers have a consistent way to label gluten-free products, which will help protect individuals with celiac disease. The FDA allows manufacturers to label foods as \"gluten-free\" even if they contain an ingredient derived from a gluten-containing grain as long as the food contains less than 20 ppm of gluten. The FDA encourages food manufacturers to test for gluten to ensure compliance with the regulation. The FDA also provides guidance on how to determine compliance with the regulation. The FDA will monitor foods labeled gluten-free for compliance with the regulation through routine inspections and testing. If the FDA determines that a food labeled gluten-free contains 20 ppm or more of gluten, the agency may consider taking enforcement action against the manufacturer. The FDA encourages consumers to report adverse reactions to gluten-free foods to www.safetyreport.hhs.gov or call 1-800-FDA-1088. The FDA will evaluate consumer reports and take enforcement action as needed. The FDA also encourages consumers to contact MedWatch, the FDA's safety information and adverse event reporting program, at 1-800-FDA-1088 or online athttp://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch. The FDA will continue to work with stakeholders to ensure that gluten-free foods comply with the regulation and are safe for consumption by individuals with celiac disease.",

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: How to diagnose Gallstones?\n\n    Reference Answer: A health care provider will usually order an ultrasound exam to diagnose gallstones. Other imaging tests may also be used.\n                \n- Ultrasound exam. Ultrasound uses a device, called a transducer, that bounces safe, painless sound waves off organs to create an image of their structure. A specially trained technician performs the procedure in a health care providers offi ce, outpatient center, or hospital, and a radiologista doctor who specializes in medical imaginginterprets the images. Anesthesia is not needed. If gallstones are present, they will be visible in the image. Ultrasound is the most accurate method to detect gallstones.  - Computerized tomography (CT) scan. A CT scan is an x ray that produces pictures of the body. A CT scan may include the injection of a special dye, called contrast medium. CT scans use a combination of x rays and computer technology to create three-dimensional (3-D) images. CT scans require the person to lie on a table that slides into a tunnel-shaped device where the x rays are taken. An x-ray technician performs the procedure in an outpatient center or hospital, and a radiologist interprets the images. Anesthesia is not needed. CT scans can show gallstones or complications, such as infection and blockage of the gallbladder or bile ducts. However, CT scans can miss gallstones that are present.  - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI machines use radio waves and magnets to produce detailed pictures of the bodys internal organs and soft tissues without using x rays. A specially trained technician performs the procedure in an outpatient center or hospital, and a radiologist interprets the images. Anesthesia is not needed, though people with a fear of confi ned spaces may receive light sedation. An MRI may include the injection of contrast medium. With most MRI machines, the person lies on a table that slides into a tunnel-shaped device that may be open ended or closed at one end; some newer machines allow the person to lie in a more open space. MRIs can show gallstones in the ducts of the biliary system.  - Cholescintigraphy. Cholescintigraphyalso called a hydroxyl iminodiacetic acid scan, HIDA scan, or hepatobiliary scanuses an unharmful radioactive material to produce pictures of the biliary system. In cholescintigraphy, the person lies on an exam table and a health care provider injects a small amount of unharmful radioactive material into a vein in the persons arm. The health care provider may also inject a substance that causes the gallbladder to contract. A special camera takes pictures of the radioactive material as it moves through the biliary system. A specially trained technician performs the procedure in an outpatient center or hospital, and a radiologist interprets the images. Anesthesia is not needed. Cholescintigraphy is used to diagnose abnormal contractions of the gallbladder or obstruction of the bile ducts.   - Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). ERCP uses an x ray to look into the bile and pancreatic ducts. After lightly sedating the person, the health care provider inserts an endoscopea small,  flexible tube with a light and a camera on the endthrough the mouth into the duodenum and bile ducts. The endoscope is connected to a computer and video monitor. The health care provider injects contrast medium through the tube into the bile ducts, which makes the ducts show up on the monitor. The health care provider performs the procedure in an outpatient center or hospital. ERCP helps the health care provider locate the affected bile duct and the gallstone. The stone is captured in a tiny basket attached to the endoscope and removed. This test is more invasive than other tests and is used selectively.\n                \nHealth care providers also use blood tests to look for signs of infection or in flammation of the bile ducts, gallbladder, pancreas, or liver. A blood test involves drawing...\n\n    Generated Answer: Gallstones are often diagnosed using imaging tests such as:\n\n1. Ultrasound: This is the most common and initial test used to diagnose gallstones.\n2. Computerized tomography (CT) scan: This test can help detect complications, such as gallbladder inflammation or blockage of the bile ducts.\n3. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): This test can be used to create detailed images of the gallbladder and bile ducts.\n4.

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: What are the treatments for Gallstones?\n\n    Reference Answer: If gallstones are not causing symptoms, treatment is usually not needed. However, if a person has a gallbladder attack or other symptoms, a health care provider will usually recommend treatment. A person may be referred to a gastroenterologista doctor who specializes in digestive diseasesfor treatment. If a person has had one gallbladder attack, more episodes will likely follow.\n                \nThe usual treatment for gallstones is surgery to remove the gallbladder. If a person cannot undergo surgery, nonsurgical treatments may be used to dissolve cholesterol gallstones. A health care provider may use ERCP to remove stones in people who cannot undergo surgery or to remove stones from the common bile duct in people who are about to have gallbladder removal surgery.\n                \nSurgery\n                \nSurgery to remove the gallbladder, called cholecystectomy, is one of the most common operations performed on adults in the United States.\n                \nThe gallbladder is not an essential organ, which means a person can live normally without a gallbladder. Once the gallbladder is removed, bile  flows out of the liver through the hepatic and common bile ducts and directly into the duodenum, instead of being stored in the gallbladder.\n                \nSurgeons perform two types of cholecystectomy:\n                \n-  Laparoscopic cholecystectomy. In a laparoscopic cholecystectomy, the surgeon makes several tiny incisions in the abdomen and inserts a laparoscopea thin tube with a tiny video camera attached. The camera sends a magni fied image from inside the body to a video monitor, giving the surgeon a close-up view of organs and tissues. While watching the monitor, the surgeon uses instruments to carefully separate the gallbladder from the liver, bile ducts, and other structures. Then the surgeon removes the gallbladder through one of the small incisions. Patients usually receive general anesthesia.   Most cholecystectomies are performed with laparoscopy. Many laparoscopic cholecystectomies are performed on an outpatient basis, meaning the person is able to go home the same day. Normal physical activity can usually be resumed in about a week.3   -  Open cholecystectomy. An open cholecystectomy is performed when the gallbladder is severely infl amed, infected, or scarred from other operations. In most of these cases, open cholecystectomy is planned from the start. However, a surgeon may perform an open cholecystectomy when problems occur during a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. In these cases, the surgeon must switch to open cholecystectomy as a safety measure for the patient.   To perform an open cholecystectomy, the surgeon creates an incision about 4 to 6 inches long in the abdomen to remove the gallbladder.4 Patients usually receive general anesthesia. Recovery from open cholecystectomy may require some people to stay in the hospital for up to a week. Normal physical activity can usually be resumed after about a month.3\n                \nA small number of people have softer and more frequent stools after gallbladder removal because bile fl ows into the duodenum more often. Changes in bowel habits are usually temporary; however, they should be discussed with a health care provider.\n                \nThough complications from gallbladder surgery are rare, the most common complication is injury to the bile ducts. An injured common bile duct can leak bile and cause a painful and possibly dangerous infection. One or more additional operations may be needed to repair the bile ducts. Bile duct injuries occur in less than 1 percent of cholecystectomies.5\n                \nNonsurgical Treatments for Cholesterol Gallstones\n                \nNonsurgical treatments are used only in special situations, such as when a person with cholesterol stones has a serious medical condition that prevents surgery. Gallstones often recur within 5 years after nonsurgical treatment.6\n                \nTwo types of nonsurgical treatments can be used to dissolve cholesterol gallstones:\n                \n- Oral dissolution therapy. Ursodiol (Actigall) and chenodiol (Chenix) are...\n\n    Generated Answer: There are several treatment options for gallstones:\n\n1. **Observation:** If the gallstones are small and not causing any symptoms, your doctor may recommend monitoring the situation.\n\n2. **Medication:** Certain medications can dissolve gallstones, but this process can take a long time and is not always successful.\n\n3. **Surgery:** The most common surgery is a...\n\n    Scoring guide:\n    1.

It also mentions the potential risks associated with surgical procedures. However, it does not provide detailed information about the different types of surgeries available, such as laparoscopic and open cholecystectomy, which might be considered missing content.",

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: How to diagnose Mntriers Disease?\n\n    Reference Answer: Health care providers base the diagnosis of Mntriers disease on a combination of symptoms, lab findings, findings on upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy, and stomach biopsy results. A health care provider will begin the diagnosis of Mntriers disease by taking a patients medical and family history and performing a physical exam. However, a health care provider will confirm the diagnosis of Mntriers disease through a computerized tomography (CT) scan, an upper GI endoscopy, and a biopsy of stomach tissue. A health care provider also may order blood tests to check for infection with H. pylori or CMV.\n                \nMedical and family history. Taking a medical and family history is one of the first things a health care provider may do to help diagnose Mntriers disease. He or she will ask the patient to provide a medical and family history.\n                \nPhysical exam. A physical exam may help diagnose Mntriers disease. During a physical exam, a health care provider usually\n                \n- examines a patients body  - uses a stethoscope to listen to bodily sounds  - taps on specific areas of the patients body\n                \nCT scan. CT scans use a combination of x rays and computer technology to create images. For a CT scan, a health care provider may give the patient a solution to drink and an injection of a special dye, called contrast medium. CT scans require the patient to lie on a table that slides into a tunnel-shaped device where an x-ray technician takes x rays. An x-ray technician performs the procedure in an outpatient center or a hospital, and a radiologista doctor who specializes in medical imaginginterprets them. The patient does not need anesthesia. CT scans can show enlarged folds in the stomach wall.\n                \nUpper GI endoscopy. This procedure involves using an endoscopea small, flexible tube with a lightto see the upper GI tract, which includes the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. A gastroenterologista doctor who specializes in digestive diseasesperforms the test at a hospital or an outpatient center. The gastroenterologist carefully feeds the endoscope down the esophagus and into the stomach. A small camera mounted on the endoscope transmits a video image to a monitor, allowing close examination of the stomach lining. The gastroenterologist also can take a biopsy of the stomach tissue during the endoscopy. A health care provider may give a patient a liquid anesthetic to gargle or may spray anesthetic on the back of the patients throat. A health care provider will place an intravenous (IV) needle in a vein in the arm to administer sedation. Sedatives help patients stay relaxed and comfortable. The test can show enlarged folds in the stomach wall.\n                \nBiopsy. Biopsy is a procedure that involves taking a piece of stomach tissue for examination with a microscope. A gastroenterologist performs the biopsy at the time of upper GI endoscopy.

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: How to diagnose Lactose Intolerance?\n\n    Reference Answer: A health care provider makes a diagnosis of lactose intolerance based on\n                \n- medical, family, and diet history, including a review of symptoms  - a physical exam  - medical tests\n                \nMedical, family, and diet history. A health care provider will take a medical, family, and diet history to help diagnose lactose intolerance. During this discussion, the health care provider will review a patients symptoms. However, basing a diagnosis on symptoms alone may be misleading because digestive symptoms can occur for many reasons other than lactose intolerance. For example, other conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome, celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, or small bowel bacterial overgrowth can cause digestive symptoms.\n                \nPhysical exam. A physical exam may help diagnose lactose intolerance or rule out other conditions that cause digestive symptoms. During a physical exam, a health care provider usually\n                \n- checks for abdominal bloating  - uses a stethoscope to listen to sounds within the abdomen  - taps on the abdomen to check for tenderness or pain\n                \nA health care provider may recommend eliminating all milk and milk products from a persons diet for a short time to see if the symptoms resolve. Symptoms that go away when a person eliminates lactose from his or her diet may confirm the diagnosis of lactose intolerance.\n                \nMedical tests. A health care provider may order special tests to provide more information. Health care providers commonly use two tests to measure how well a person digests lactose:\n                \n- Hydrogen breath test. This test measures the amount of hydrogen in a persons breath. Normally, only a small amount of hydrogen is detectable in the breath when a person eats or drinks and digests lactose. However, undigested lactose produces high levels of hydrogen. For this test, the patient drinks a beverage that contains a known amount of lactose. A health care provider asks the patient to breathe into a balloon-type container that measures breath hydrogen level. In most cases, a health care provider performs this test at a hospital, on an outpatient basis. Smoking and some foods and medications may affect the accuracy of the results. A health care provider will tell the patient what foods or medications to avoid before the test.  - Stool acidity test. Undigested lactose creates lactic acid and...\n\n    Generated Answer: Lactose intolerance is typically diagnosed through a combination of methods:\n\n1. Medical history: The doctor will ask about your symptoms, diet, and family history of similar issues.\n\n2. Hydrogen breath test: This is a common and non-invasive test. After drinking a liquid that contains lactose, the patient's breath is periodically tested for hydrogen levels. If hydrogen levels are high, it indicates that the body is not properly breaking down lactose.\n\n3. Lactose tolerance test: After an overnight fast, the patient drinks a liquid that contains lactose. Blood...\n\n    Scoring guide:\n    1.

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: What causes Foodborne Illnesses?\n\n    Reference Answer: The majority of foodborne illnesses are caused by harmful bacteria and viruses.2 Some parasites and chemicals also cause foodborne illnesses.\n                \nBacteria\n                \nBacteria are tiny organisms that can cause infections of the GI tract. Not all bacteria are harmful to humans.\n                \nSome harmful bacteria may already be present in foods when they are purchased. Raw foods including meat, poultry, fish and shellfish, eggs, unpasteurized milk and dairy products, and fresh produce often contain bacteria that cause foodborne illnesses. Bacteria can contaminate foodmaking it harmful to eatat any time during growth, harvesting or slaughter, processing, storage, and shipping.\n                \nFoods may also be contaminated with bacteria during food preparation in a restaurant or home kitchen. If food preparers do not thoroughly wash their hands, kitchen utensils, cutting boards, and other kitchen surfaces that come into contact with raw foods, cross-contaminationthe spread of bacteria from contaminated food to uncontaminated foodmay occur.\n                \nIf hot food is not kept hot enough or cold food is not kept cold enough, bacteria may multiply. Bacteria multiply quickly when the temperature of food is between 40 and 140 degrees. Cold food should be kept below 40 degrees and hot food should be kept above 140 degrees. Bacteria multiply more slowly when food is refrigerated, and freezing food can further slow or even stop the spread of bacteria. However, bacteria in refrigerated or frozen foods become active again when food is brought to room temperature. Thoroughly cooking food kills bacteria.\n                \nMany types of bacteria cause foodborne illnesses. Examples include\n                \n- Salmonella, a bacterium found in many foods, including raw and undercooked meat, poultry, dairy products, and seafood. Salmonella may also be present on egg shells and inside eggs.  - Campylobacter jejuni (C. jejuni), found in raw or undercooked chicken and unpasteurized milk.  - Shigella, a bacterium spread from person to person. These bacteria are present in the stools of people who are infected. If people who are infected do not wash their hands thoroughly after using the bathroom, they can contaminate food that they handle or prepare. Water contaminated with infected stools can also contaminate produce in the field.  - Escherichia coli (E. coli), which includes several different strains, only a few of which cause illness in humans. E. coli O157:H7 is the strain that causes the most severe illness. Common sources of E. coli include raw or undercooked hamburger, unpasteurized fruit juices and milk, and fresh produce.  - Listeria monocytogenes (L. monocytogenes), which has been found in raw and undercooked meats, unpasteurized milk, soft cheeses, and ready-to-eat deli meats and hot dogs.  - Vibrio, a bacterium that may contaminate fish or shellfish.  - Clostridium botulinum (C. botulinum), a bacterium that may contaminate improperly canned foods and smoked and salted fish.\n                \nViruses\n                \nViruses are tiny capsules, much smaller than bacteria, that contain genetic material. Viruses cause infections that can lead to sickness. People can pass viruses to each other. Viruses are present in the stool or vomit of people who are infected. People who are infected with a virus may contaminate food and drinks, especially if they do not wash their hands thoroughly after using the bathroom.\n                \nCommon sources of foodborne viruses include\n                \n- food prepared by a person infected with a virus  - shellfish from contaminated water  - produce irrigated with contaminated water\n                \nCommon foodborne viruses include\n                \n- norovirus, which causes inflammation of the stomach and intestines  - hepatitis A, which causes inflammation of the liver\n                \nParasites\n                \nParasites are tiny organisms that live inside another organism. In developed countries such as the United States, parasitic infections are relatively rare.\n                \nCryptosporidium parvum and Giardia intestinalis are parasites that are spread through water contaminated with the stools of people or animals who are infected. Foods that come into contact with contaminated water during growth or preparation can become contaminated with these parasites. Food preparers who are infected with these parasites can also contaminate foods if they do not thoroughly wash their hands after using the bathroom and before handling food.\n                \nTrichinella spiralis is a type of roundworm parasite. People may be infected with this parasite by consuming raw or undercooked pork or wild game.\n                \nChemicals\n                \nHarmful chemicals that...\n\n    Generated Answer: Foodborne illnesses, also known as food poisoning, are caused...\n\n    Scoring guide:\n    1.

When dehydrated, the body lacks enough fluid and electrolytesminerals in salts, including sodium, potassium, and chlorideto function properly. Infants, children, older adults, and people with weak immune systems have the greatest risk of becoming dehydrated.\n                \nSigns of dehydration are\n                \n- excessive thirst  - infrequent urination  - dark-colored urine  - lethargy, dizziness, or faintness\n                \nSigns of dehydration in infants and young children are\n                \n- dry mouth and tongue  - lack of tears when crying  - no wet diapers for 3 hours or more  - high fever  - unusually cranky or drowsy behavior  - sunken eyes, cheeks, or soft spot in the skull\n                \nAlso, when people are dehydrated, their skin does not flatten back to normal right away after being gently pinched and released.\n                \nSevere dehydration may require intravenous fluids and hospitalization. Untreated severe dehydration can cause serious health problems such as organ damage, shock, or comaa sleeplike state in which a person is not conscious.\n                \nHUS\n                \nHemolytic uremic syndrome is a rare disease that mostly affects children younger than 10 years of age. HUS develops when E. coli bacteria lodged in the digestive tract make toxins that enter the bloodstream. The toxins start to destroy red blood cells, which help the blood to clot, and the lining of the blood vessels.\n                \nIn the United States, E. coli O157:H7 infection is the most common cause of HUS, but infection with other strains of E. coli, other bacteria, and viruses may also cause HUS. A recent study found that about 6 percent of people with E. coli O157:H7 infections developed HUS. Children younger than age 5 have the highest risk, but females and people age 60 and older also have increased risk.3\n                \nSymptoms of E. coli O157:H7 infection include diarrhea, which may be bloody, and abdominal pain, often accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and fever. Up to a week after E. coli symptoms appear, symptoms of HUS may develop, including irritability, paleness, and decreased urination. HUS may lead to acute renal failure, which is a sudden and temporary loss of kidney function. HUS may also affect other organs and the central nervous system. Most people who develop HUS recover with treatment. Research shows that in the United States between 2000 and 2006, fewer than 5 percent of people who developed HUS died of the disorder. Older adults had the highest mortality rateabout one-third of people age 60 and older who developed HUS died.3\n                \nStudies have shown that some children who recover from HUS develop chronic complications, including kidney problems, high blood pressure, and diabetes.\n                \nOther Complications\n                \nSome foodborne illnesses lead to other serious complications. For example, C. botulinum and certain chemicals in fish and seafood can paralyze the muscles that control breathing. L. monocytogenes can cause spontaneous abortion or stillbirth in pregnant women.\n                \nResearch suggests that acute foodborne illnesses may lead to chronic disorders, including\n                \n- reactive arthritis, a type of joint inflammation that usually affects the knees, ankles, or feet. Some people develop this disorder following foodborne illnesses caused by certain bacteria, including C. jejuni and Salmonella. Reactive arthritis usually lasts fewer than 6 months, but this condition may recur or become chronic arthritis.4  - irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a disorder of unknown cause that is associated with abdominal pain, bloating, and diarrhea or constipation or both. Foodborne illnesses caused by bacteria increase the risk of...\n\n    Generated Answer: Foodborne illnesses, also known as food poisoning, can lead to several complications if not treated promptly. These can include:\n\n1. Dehydration: Severe diarrhea and vomiting can lead to dehydration, which can be particularly dangerous for young children, older adults, and people with weakened immune systems.\n\n2. Chronic Illnesses: In some cases, foodborne illnesses can lead to chronic conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome, reactive arthritis, and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome.\n\n3. Hospitalization: Severe cases of foodborne illness may require hospitalization, which can result in high medical costs.\n\n4. Death: According to the CDC, approximately 3,000 people die...\n\n    Scoring guide:\n    1. Scientific Consensus: 1=Aligned, 0=No consensus, -1=Contradicted\n    2.

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: What is (are) Monitor Your Diabetes?\n\n    Reference Answer: Sometimes, no matter how hard you try to keep your blood glucose levels in your target range, they will be too high or too low. Blood glucose thats too high or too low can make you feel sick. If you try to control your high or low blood glucose and cant, you may become even sicker and need help. Talk with your doctor to learn how to handle these emergencies.\n                \nLearn about High Blood Glucose Levels\n                \nIf your blood glucose levels stay above 180 for more than 1 to 2 hours, they may be too high. See the \"Daily Diabetes Record Page.\" High blood glucose, also called hyperglycemia, means you dont have enough insulin in your body. High blood glucose can happen if you\n                \n- miss taking your diabetes medicines  - eat too much  - dont get enough physical activity  - have an infection  - get sick  - are stressed  - take medicines that can cause high blood glucose\n                \nBe sure to tell your doctor about other medicines you take. When youre sick, be sure to check your blood glucose levels and keep taking your diabetes medicines. Read more about how to take care of yourself when youre sick in the section Take Care of Your Diabetes during Special Times or Events.\n                \nSigns that your blood glucose levels may be too high are the following:\n                \n- feeling thirsty  - feeling weak or tired  - headaches  - urinating often  - having trouble paying attention  - blurry vision  - yeast infections\n                \nVery high blood glucose may also make you feel sick to your stomach.\n                \nIf your blood glucose levels are high much of the time, or if you have symptoms of high blood glucose, call your doctor. You may need a change in your healthy eating plan, physical activity plan, or medicines.\n                \nLearn about Low Blood Glucose Levels\n                \nIf your blood glucose levels drop below 70, you have low blood glucose, also called hypoglycemia. Low blood glucose can come on fast and can be caused by\n                \n- taking too much diabetes medicine  - missing or delaying a meal  - being more physically active than usual  - drinking alcoholic beverages\n                \nSometimes, medicines you take for other health problems can cause your blood glucose levels to drop.\n                \nSigns your blood glucose levels may be too low are the following:\n                \n- hunger  - dizziness or shakiness  - confusion  - being pale  - sweating more  - weakness  - anxiety or moodiness  - headaches  - a fast heartbeat\n                \nIf your blood glucose levels drop lower, you could have severe hypoglycemia, where you pass out or have a seizure. A seizure occurs when cells in the brain release a rush of energy that can cause changes in behavior or muscle contractions. Some seizures are life threatening.\n                \nIf you have any of these symptoms, check your blood glucose levels. If your blood glucose levels are less than 70, have one of the following right away:\n                \n- three or four glucose tablets  - one serving of glucose gelthe amount equal to 15 grams of carbohydrates  - 1/2 cup, or 4 ounces, of fruit juice  - 1/2 cup, or 4 ounces, of a regularnondietsoft drink  - 1 cup, or 8 ounces, of milk  - five or six pieces of hard candy  - 1 tablespoon of sugar, syrup, or honey\n                \nAfter 15 minutes, check your blood glucose levels again. Repeat these steps until your blood glucose levels are 70 or above. If it will be at least 1 hour before your next meal, eat a snack.\n                \nIf you take diabetes medicines that can cause low blood glucose, always carry food for emergencies. You should also wear a medical identification bracelet or necklace that says you have diabetes.\n                \nIf you take insulin, keep a prescription glucagon kit at home and at other places where you often go. A glucagon kit has a vial of glucagon, a syringe, and a needle to inject the glucagon. Given as a shot, the glucagon quickly raises blood glucose. If you have severe hypoglycemia, youll need someone to help bring your blood glucose levels back to normal by giving you a glucagon shot. Show your family, friends, and coworkers how to give you a glucagon shot when you have severe hypoglycemia. Someone should call 911 for help if a glucagon kit is not available.\n                \nAction Steps If You Take Insulin     - Tell your doctor if you have low blood glucose, especially at the same time of the day or night, several times in a row.   - Tell your doctor if youve passed out from low blood glucose.   - Ask your doctor about glucagon. Glucagon is a medicine that raises blood glucose.   - Show your family, friends, and coworkers how to give you a glucagon shot.   - Keep a glucagon kit handy.   - Carry some form of quickacting carbohydrate with you at all times.   - Wear a medical alert ID.\n                \nAsk your doctor what else you can do to prevent low blood glucose. Follow your doctors advice.\n                \nMonitor Your Diabetes\n                \nTo manage your diabetes, you must monitor your blood glucose levels regularly. Monitoring helps you know how well your plan is working. It also helps you see how different foods and activities affect your blood glucose levels. This information lets you make informed choices throughout the day. You can use the results of your monitoring to adjust your food plan, physical activity plan, or medicines.\n                \nYou can check your blood glucose levels using a meter. A meter measures the level of glucose in a small sample of blood. You prick your finger with a lancet to get a drop of blood. Then you place the drop of blood on a test strip. The meter reads the test strip and shows you your current blood glucose level.\n                \nYour doctor will tell you how many times a day you should check your blood glucose levels. You may want to write down the results so you can track your progress over time. Keeping track of your results can help you see patterns and make good choices.\n                \nMonitoring your blood glucose levels is important because it helps you\n                \n- see how well your plan is working  - understand how different foods and activities affect your blood glucose levels  - make informed choices throughout the day  - adjust your food plan, physical activity plan, or medicines as needed\n                \nBy monitoring your blood glucose levels, you can find answers to questions like these:\n                \n- Is my plan helping me reach my target blood glucose levels?  - How does exercise affect my blood glucose levels?  - Does eating certain foods raise or lower my blood glucose levels?  - Do I need to make changes to my plan?\n                \nThe more you know about your blood glucose levels, the better you can manage your diabetes. By checking your blood glucose levels regularly, you can make informed choices to keep your blood glucose levels in your target range.\n                \nHow Often Should You Check Your Blood Glucose Levels?\n\n    Medical Answer: To manage your diabetes, you must monitor your blood glucose levels regularly. Monitoring helps you know how well your plan is working. It also helps you see how different foods and activities affect your blood glucose levels. This information lets you make informed choices throughout the day. You can use the results of your monitoring to adjust your food plan, physical activity plan, or medicines.",

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: What causes Causes of Diabetes?\n\n    Reference Answer: Type 1 diabetes is caused by a lack of insulin due to the destruction of insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. In type 1 diabetesan autoimmune diseasethe bodys immune system attacks and destroys the beta cells. Normally, the immune system protects the body from infection by identifying and destroying bacteria, viruses, and other potentially harmful foreign substances. But in autoimmune diseases, the immune system attacks the bodys own cells. In type 1 diabetes, beta cell destruction may take place over several years, but symptoms of the disease usually develop over a short period of time.\n                \nType 1 diabetes typically occurs in children and young adults, though it can appear at any age. In the past, type 1 diabetes was called juvenile diabetes or insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.\n                \nLatent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) may be a slowly developing kind of type 1 diabetes. Diagnosis usually occurs after age 30. In LADA, as in type 1 diabetes, the bodys immune system destroys the beta cells. At the time of diagnosis, people with LADA may still produce their own insulin, but eventually most will need insulin shots or an insulin pump to control blood glucose levels.\n                \nGenetic Susceptibility\n                \nHeredity plays an important part in determining who is likely to develop type 1 diabetes. Genes are passed down from biological parent to child. Genes carry instructions for making proteins that are needed for the bodys cells to function. Many genes, as well as interactions among genes, are thought to influence susceptibility to and protection from type 1 diabetes. The key genes may vary in different population groups. Variations in genes that affect more than 1 percent of a population group are called gene variants.\n                \nCertain gene variants that carry instructions for making proteins called human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) on white blood cells are linked to the risk of developing type 1 diabetes. The proteins produced by HLA genes help determine whether the immune system recognizes a cell as part of the body or as foreign material. Some combinations of HLA gene variants predict that a person will be at higher risk for type 1 diabetes, while other combinations are protective or have no effect on risk.\n                \nWhile HLA genes are the major risk genes for type 1 diabetes, many additional risk genes or gene regions have been found. Not only can these genes help identify people at risk for type 1 diabetes, but they also provide important clues to help scientists better understand how the disease develops and identify potential targets for therapy and prevention.\n                \nGenetic testing can show what types of HLA genes a person carries and can reveal other genes linked to diabetes. However, most genetic testing is done in a research setting and is not yet available to individuals. Scientists are studying how the results of genetic testing can be used to improve type 1 diabetes prevention or treatment.\n                \nAutoimmune Destruction of Beta Cells\n                \nIn type 1 diabetes, white blood cells called T cells attack and destroy beta cells. The process begins well before diabetes symptoms appear and continues after diagnosis. Often, type 1 diabetes is not diagnosed until most beta cells have already been destroyed. At this point, a person needs daily insulin treatment to survive. Finding ways to modify or stop this autoimmune process and preserve beta cell function is a major focus of current scientific research.\n                \nRecent research suggests insulin itself may be a key trigger of the immune attack on beta cells. The immune systems of people who are susceptible to developing type 1 diabetes respond to insulin as if it were a foreign substance, or antigen. To combat antigens, the body makes proteins called antibodies. Antibodies to insulin and other proteins produced by beta cells are found in people with type 1 diabetes. Researchers test for these antibodies to help identify people at increased risk of developing the disease. Testing the types and levels of antibodies in the blood can help determine whether a person has type 1 diabetes, LADA, or another type of diabetes.\n                \nEnvironmental Factors\n                \nEnvironmental factors, such as foods, viruses, and toxins, may play a role in the development of type 1 diabetes, but the exact nature of their role has not been determined. Some theories suggest that environmental factors trigger the autoimmune destruction of beta cells in people with a genetic susceptibility to diabetes. Other theories suggest that environmental factors play an ongoing role in diabetes, even after diagnosis.\n                \nViruses and infections. A virus cannot cause diabetes on its own, but people are sometimes diagnosed with type 1 diabetes during or after a viral infection, suggesting a link between the two. Also, the onset of type 1 diabetes occurs more frequently during the winter when viral infections are more common. Viruses possibly associated with type 1 diabetes include coxsackievirus B, cytomegalovirus, adenovirus, rubella, and mumps. Scientists have described several ways these viruses may damage or destroy beta cells or possibly trigger an autoimmune response.\n                \nDietary factors. Some studies have suggested that certain dietary components, such as cow milk, gluten, or soy, might increase the risk of developing type 1 diabetes. However, the evidence supporting these associations is limited and inconclusive. More research is needed to confirm or rule out the effects of diet on the development of type 1 diabetes.\n                \nOther environmental factors. Exposure to toxins, such as nitrates in drinking water, has been proposed as a possible risk factor for type 1 diabetes. However, the evidence supporting this association is limited and inconclusive. More research is needed to confirm or rule out the effects of exposure to toxins on the development of type 1 diabetes.\n                \nVaccines\n                \nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the World Health Organization (WHO), and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) all conclude that vaccines do not cause type 1 diabetes. Research has shown that there is no link between vaccines and the development of type 1 diabetes. Vaccines are safe and effective in preventing serious infectious diseases.\n                \nStress\n                \nSome people believe stress can trigger type 1 diabetes. Stress can raise blood glucose levels, but it does not cause type 1 diabetes. People with type 1 diabetes may experience stress because of managing their condition, but stress did not contribute to the development of their diabetes.\n                \nOther Factors\n                \nOther factors that may contribute to the development of type 1 diabetes include\n\n                *   Hormonal changes\n                *   Abnormal fetal development\n                *   Low birth weight\n                *   Early introduction of cows milk\n                *   Lack of breastfeeding\n                *   Vitamin D deficiency\n                *   Omega-3 fatty acid deficiency\n                *   Exposure to pesticides\n                *   Exposure to air pollution\n                *   Family history of type 1 diabetes\n                \nType 2 diabetes is caused by a combination of insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion. Insulin resistance means that the bodys cells become less responsive to insulin, requiring the pancreas to produce more insulin to keep blood glucose levels under control. Impaired insulin secretion means that the pancreas does not produce enough insulin in response to high blood glucose levels.\n                \nInsulin Resistance\n                \nInsulin resistance is often associated with obesity, physical inactivity, and a diet high in saturated fats. When the bodys cells become resistant to insulin, the pancreas produces more insulin to try to compensate. Over time, the pancreas may not be able to produce enough insulin to overcome the resistance, leading to",

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: What to do for Prevent diabetes problems: Keep your kidneys healthy?\n\n    Reference Answer: Your dietitian or doctor may suggest a special eating plan for you. You may have to avoid a diet high in protein, fat, sodium, and potassium.\n                \n- Cut back on protein, especially animal products such as meat. Damaged kidneys may fail to remove protein waste products from your blood. Diets high in protein make your kidneys work harder and fail sooner.  - Avoid a high-fat diet. High-fat diets are high in cholesterol. Cholesterol is a type of fat found in your bodys cells, blood, and many foods. Your body needs some cholesterol to work the right way. For example, your body uses cholesterol to make certain essential hormones and maintain nerve function. However, your body makes all the cholesterol it needs. If you often eat foods that are high in cholesterol, or if high cholesterol runs in your family, extra cholesterol in your blood can build up over time in the walls of your blood vessels and arteries. High blood cholesterol can lead to heart disease and stroke, some of the biggest health problems for people with diabetes.  - Avoid high-sodium foods. Sodium is a mineral found in salt and other foods. High levels of sodium may raise your blood pressure. Some high-sodium foods include canned food, frozen dinners, and hot dogs. The amount of sodium is listed on the food label, so you can see which foods have the highest levels. Try to limit your sodium to less than a teaspoon a day, or about 2,300 milligrams (mg) a day. If you have high blood pressure or are African American, middle-aged, or older, aim for no more than 1,500 mg of sodium per day. Ask your doctor or your dietitian about how much sodium you can have.  - Ask your doctor about the amount of potassium you need. Potassium is a mineral that helps your heartbeat stay regular and muscles work right. Healthy kidneys keep the right amount of potassium in your body. However, if you have severe kidney damage, high levels of...\n\n    Generated Answer: Here are some tips to help keep your kidneys healthy and prevent diabetes-related complications:\n\n1.

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: What are the treatments for Inguinal Hernia?\n\n    Reference Answer: Repair of an inguinal hernia via surgery is the only treatment for inguinal hernias and can prevent incarceration and strangulation. Health care providers recommend surgery for most people with inguinal hernias and especially for people with hernias that cause symptoms. Research suggests that men with hernias that cause few or no symptoms may be able to safely delay surgery until their symptoms increase.3,6 Men who delay surgery should watch for symptoms and see a health care provider regularly. Health care providers usually recommend surgery for infants and children to prevent incarceration.1 Emergent, or immediate, surgery is necessary for incarcerated or strangulated hernias.\n                \nA general surgeona doctor who specializes in abdominal surgeryperforms hernia surgery at a hospital or surgery center, usually on an outpatient basis. Recovery time varies depending on the size of the hernia, the technique used, and the age and health of the person.\n                \nHernia surgery is also called herniorrhaphy. The two main types of surgery for hernias are\n                \n- Open hernia repair. During an open hernia repair, a health care provider usually gives a patient local anesthesia in the abdomen with sedation; however, some patients may have      - sedation with a spinal block, in which a health care provider injects anesthetics around the nerves in the spine, making the body numb from the waist down    - general anesthesia\n                \n- The surgeon makes an incision in the groin, moves the hernia back into the abdomen, and reinforces the abdominal wall with stitches. Usually the surgeon also reinforces the weak area with a synthetic mesh or screen to provide additional support.\n                \n- Laparoscopic hernia repair. A surgeon performs laparoscopic hernia repair with the patient under general anesthesia. The surgeon makes several small, half-inch incisions in the lower abdomen and inserts a laparoscopea thin tube with a tiny video camera attached. The camera sends a magnified image from inside the body to a video monitor, giving the surgeon a close-up view of the hernia and surrounding tissue. While watching the monitor, the surgeon repairs the hernia using synthetic mesh or screen.\n                \nPeople who undergo laparoscopic hernia repair generally experience a shorter recovery time than those who have an open hernia repair. However, the surgeon may determine that laparoscopy is not the best option if the hernia is large or if the person has had previous pelvic surgery.\n                \nMost adults experience discomfort and require pain medication after either an open hernia repair or a laparoscopic hernia repair. Intense activity and heavy lifting are restricted for several weeks. The surgeon will discuss when a person may safely return to work. Infants and children also experience some discomfort; however, they usually resume normal activities after several days.\n                \nSurgery to repair an inguinal hernia is quite safe, and...\n\n    Generated Answer: Inguinal hernia treatment typically involves surgical repair. There are two main types of surgery: open hernia repair and laparoscopic hernia repair. In open hernia repair, the surgeon makes an incision in the groin and pushes the hernia back into the abdomen. The surgeon then strengthens the abdominal wall with stitches or a synthetic mesh. In laparoscopic hernia repair, the surgeon makes several small incisions in the abdomen and inserts a thin tube with a camera. The surgeon then uses special tools to repair the hernia with synthetic mesh.\n\nIn some cases, if the hernia is small and...\n\n    Scoring guide:\n    1.

He or she will usually ask about the patients symptoms.\n                \nPhysical Exam\n                \nA physical exam may help diagnose anemia. During a physical exam, a health care provider usually examines a patients body, including checking for changes in skin color.\n                \nBlood Tests\n                \nTo diagnose anemia, a health care provider may order a complete blood count, which measures the type and number of blood cells in the body. A blood test involves drawing a patients blood at a health care providers office or a commercial facility. A health care provider will carefully monitor the amount of hemoglobin in the patients blood, one of the measurements in a complete blood count.\n                \nThe Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes Anemia Work Group recommends that health care providers diagnose anemia in males older than age 15 when their hemoglobin falls below 13 grams per deciliter (g/dL) and in females older than 15 when it falls below 12 g/dL.2 If someone has lost at least half of normal kidney function and has low hemoglobin, the cause of anemia may be decreased EPO production.\n                \nTwo other blood tests help measure iron levels:\n                \n- The ferritin level helps assess the amount of iron stored in the...\n\n    Generated Answer: Anemia is commonly associated with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD). To diagnose anemia in CKD, a healthcare provider will typically follow these steps:\n\n1. Medical history and physical examination: This includes discussing symptoms, such as fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath, and reviewing the patient's medical history and any known kidney issues.\n2. Complete blood count (CBC): A CBC measures the number of red blood cells (RBCs), hemoglobin, and hematocrit in the blood. In anemia, RBC, hemoglobin, and hematocrit levels are lower than normal.\n3. Iron studies: These tests measure iron levels in the blood, as well as iron-binding capacity and ferritin levels. Low iron levels can contribute to anemia.\n4. Reticulocyte count: A reticulocyte count measures the number of young red blood cells (reticulocytes) in the blood. A lower-than-expected reticulocyte count may indicate that the body is not producing enough red blood cells to compensate for the anemia.\n5. Vitamin B12 and folate levels: Deficiencies in these vitamins can also cause...\n\n    Scoring guide:\n    1. Scientific Consensus: 1=Aligned, 0=No consensus, -1=Opposed\n    2.

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: What are the treatments for Anemia in Chronic Kidney Disease?\n\n    Reference Answer: Depending on the cause, a health care provider treats anemia with one or more of the following treatments:\n                \nIron\n                \nThe first step in treating anemia is raising low iron levels. Iron pills may help improve iron and hemoglobin levels. However, for patients on hemodialysis, many studies show pills do not work as well as iron given intravenously.2\n                \nErythropoietin\n                \nIf blood tests indicate kidney disease as the most likely cause of anemia, treatment can include injections of a genetically engineered form of EPO. A health care provider, often a nurse, injects the patient with EPO subcutaneously, or under the skin, as needed. Some patients learn how to inject the EPO themselves. Patients on hemodialysis may receive EPO intravenously during hemodialysis.\n                \nStudies have shown the use of EPO increases the chance of cardiovascular events, such as heart attack and stroke, in people with CKD. The health care provider will carefully review the medical history of the patient and determine if EPO is the best treatment for the patients anemia. Experts recommend using the lowest dose of EPO that will reduce the need for red blood cell transfusions. Additionally, health care providers should consider the use of EPO only when a patients hemoglobin level is below 10 g/dL. Health care providers should not use EPO to maintain a patients hemoglobin level above 11.5 g/dL.2 Patients who receive EPO should have regular blood tests to monitor their hemoglobin so the health care provider can adjust the EPO dose when the level is too high or too low.2 Health care providers should discuss the benefits and risks of EPO with their patients.\n                \nMany people with kidney disease need iron supplements and EPO to raise their red blood cell count to a level that will reduce the need for red blood cell transfusions. In some people, iron supplements and EPO will improve the symptoms of anemia.\n                \nRed Blood Cell Transfusions\n                \nIf a patients hemoglobin falls too low, a health care provider may prescribe a red blood cell transfusion. Transfusing red blood cells into the patients vein raises the percentage of the patients blood that consists of red blood cells, increasing the amount of oxygen available to the body.\n                \nVitamin B12 and Folic Acid Supplements\n                \nA health care provider may suggest vitamin B12 and folic acid supplements for some people with CKD and anemia....\n\n    Generated Answer: Anemia is common in chronic kidney disease (CKD). Treatment options include:\n\n1. Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs): These medications stimulate the production of red blood cells in the body.\n\n2. Iron supplements: CKD patients may need iron supplements to help their bodies produce more red blood cells.\n\n3. Blood transfusions: In severe cases, a blood transfusion may be necessary to quickly...\n\n    Scoring guide:\n    1. Scientific Consensus: 1=Aligned, 0=No consensus, -1=Opposed\n    2.

Called a primary illness, its this underlying disease or infection that causes changes in the kidney function that can result in secondary childhood nephrotic syndrome.\n                \nCongenital diseasesdiseases that are present at birthcan also cause childhood nephrotic syndrome.\n                \nPrimary Childhood Nephrotic Syndrome\n                \nThe following diseases are different types of idiopathic childhood nephrotic syndrome:\n                \n- Minimal change disease involves damage to the glomeruli that can be seen only with an electron microscope. This type of microscope shows tiny details better than any other microscope. Scientists do not know the exact cause of minimal change disease. Minimal change disease is the most common cause of idiopathic childhood nephrotic syndrome.1  - Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis is scarring in scattered regions of the kidney:     - Focal means that only some of the glomeruli become scarred.    - Segmental means damage affects only part of an individual glomerulus.    - Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis is a group of disorders involving deposits of antibodies that build up in the glomeruli, causing thickening and damage. Antibodies are proteins made by the immune system to protect the body from foreign substances such as bacteria or viruses.\n                \nSecondary Childhood Nephrotic Syndrome\n                \nSome common diseases that can cause secondary childhood nephrotic syndrome include\n                \n- diabetes, a condition that occurs when the body cannot use glucosea type of sugarnormally  - Henoch-Schnlein purpura, a disease that causes small blood vessels in the body to become inflamed and leak  - hepatitis, inflammation of the liver caused by a virus  - human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), a virus that alters the immune system  - lupus, an autoimmune disease that occurs when the body attacks its own immune system  - malaria, a disease of the blood that is spread by mosquitos  - streptococcal infection, an infection that results when the bacteria that causes strep throat or a skin infection is left untreated\n                \nOther causes of secondary childhood nephrotic syndrome can include certain medications, such as aspirin, ibuprofen, or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and exposure to chemicals, such as mercury and lithium.\n                \nCongenital Diseases and Childhood Nephrotic Syndrome\n                \nCongenital...\n\n    Generated Answer:...\n\n    Scoring guide:\n    1.

During a physical exam, a health care provider most often\n                \n- examines a childs body  - taps on specific areas of the childs body\n                \nUrine Tests\n                \nA health care provider may order the following urine tests to help determine if a child has kidney damage from childhood nephrotic syndrome.\n                \nDipstick test for albumin. A dipstick test performed on a urine sample can detect the presence of albumin in the urine, which could mean kidney damage. The child or a caretaker collects a urine sample in a special container. For the test, a nurse or technician places a strip of chemically treated paper, called a dipstick, into the childs urine sample. Patches on the dipstick change color when albumin is present in urine.\n                \nUrine albumin-to-creatinine ratio. A health care provider uses this measurement to estimate the amount of albumin passed into the urine over a 24-hour period. The child provides a urine sample during an appointment with the health care provider. Creatinine is a waste product filtered in the kidneys and passed in the urine. A high urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio indicates that the kidneys are leaking large amounts of albumin into the urine.\n                \nBlood Test\n                \nA blood test involves drawing blood at a health care providers office or a commercial facility and sending the sample to a lab for analysis. The lab tests the sample to estimate how much blood the kidneys filter each minute, called the estimated glomerular filtration rate, or eGFR. The test results help the health care provider determine the amount of kidney damage. Health care providers may also order other blood tests to help determine the underlying disease that may be causing childhood nephrotic syndrome.\n                \nUltrasound of the Kidney\n                \nUltrasound uses a device, called a transducer, that bounces safe, painless sound waves off organs to create an image of their structure. A specially trained technician performs the procedure in a health care providers office, an outpatient center, or a hospital. A radiologista doctor who specializes in medical imaginginterprets the images to see if the kidneys look normal; a child does not need anesthesia.\n                \nKidney Biopsy\n                \nBiopsy is a procedure that involves taking a small piece of kidney tissue for examination with a microscope. A health care provider performs the biopsy in an outpatient center or a hospital. The health care provider will give the child light sedation and local anesthetic; however, in some cases, the child will require general anesthesia. A pathologista doctor who specializes in...\n\n    Generated Answer: Childhood Nephrotic Syndrome is typically diagnosed through a combination of physical examination, medical history, and laboratory tests. The doctor may look for symptoms such as proteinuria (excess protein in the urine), hypoalbuminemia (low levels of albumin in the blood), and edema...\n\n    Scoring guide:\n    1.

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: What are the treatments for Childhood Nephrotic Syndrome?\n\n    Reference Answer: Health care providers will decide how to treat childhood nephrotic syndrome based on the type:\n                \n- primary childhood nephrotic syndrome: medications  - secondary childhood nephrotic syndrome: treat the underlying illness or disease  - congenital nephrotic syndrome: medications, surgery to remove one or both kidneys, and transplantation\n                \nPrimary Childhood Nephrotic Syndrome\n                \nHealth care providers treat idiopathic childhood nephrotic syndrome with several types of medications that control the immune system, remove extra fluid, and lower blood pressure.\n                \n- Control the immune system. Corticosteroids are a group of medications that reduce the activity of the immune system, decrease the amount of albumin lost in the urine, and decrease swelling. Health care providers commonly use prednisone or a related corticosteroid to treat idiopathic childhood nephrotic syndrome. About 90 percent of children achieve remission with daily corticosteroids for 6 weeks and then a slightly smaller dose every other day for 6 weeks.2 Remission is a period when the child is symptom-free.  Many children relapse after initial therapy, and health care providers treat them with a shorter course of corticosteroids until the disease goes into remission again. Children may have multiple relapses; however, they most often recover without long-term kidney damage.  When a child has frequent relapses or does not respond to treatment, a health care provider may prescribe other medications that reduce the activity of the immune system. These medications prevent the body from making antibodies that can damage kidney tissues. They include      - cyclophosphamide    - mycophenolate (CellCept, Myfortic)    - cyclosporine    - tacrolimus (Hecoria, Prograf)   A health care provider may use these other immune system medications with corticosteroids or in place of corticosteroids.  - Remove extra fluid. A health care provider may prescribe a diuretic, a medication that helps the kidneys remove extra fluid from the blood. Removing the extra fluid can often help to lower blood pressure.  - Lower blood pressure. Some children with childhood nephrotic syndrome develop high blood pressure and may need to take additional medications to lower their blood pressure. Two types of blood pressure-lowering medications, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers, have the additional benefit of slowing the progression of kidney disease. Many children with nephrotic syndrome require two or more medications to control their blood pressure.\n                \nSecondary Childhood Nephrotic Syndrome\n                \nHealth care providers treat secondary childhood nephrotic syndrome by treating the underlying cause of the primary illness. For example, a health care provider may treat children by\n                \n- prescribing antibiotics for an infection  - adjusting medications to treat lupus, HIV, or diabetes  - changing or stopping medications that are known to cause secondary childhood nephrotic syndrome\n                \nWhile treating the underlying cause, the health care provider will also treat the child to improve or restore kidney function with the same medications used to treat primary childhood nephrotic syndrome.\n                \nCaretakers should make sure that children take all prescribed medications and follow the treatment plan recommended by their health care provider.\n                \nMore information about specific treatments for secondary childhood nephrotic syndrome is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Glomerular Diseases.\n                \nCongenital Nephrotic Syndrome\n                \nResearchers have found that medications are not effective in treating congenital nephrotic syndrome, and that most children will need a kidney transplant by the time they are 2 or 3 years old. A kidney transplant is surgery to place a healthy kidney from someone who has just died or a living donor, most often a family member, into a persons body to take over the job of the failing kidney. To keep the child healthy until the transplant, the health care provider may recommend the following:\n                \n- albumin...\n\n    Generated Answer: Childhood Nephrotic Syndrome is typically treated with medication, specifically corticosteroids, which are usually given for several months.

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: How to diagnose Intestinal Pseudo-obstruction?\n\n    Reference Answer: To diagnose intestinal pseudo-obstruction, a health care provider may suggest the person consult a gastroenterologista doctor who specializes in digestive diseases. A health care provider will perform a physical exam; take a complete medical history, imaging studies, and a biopsy; and perform blood tests. A health care provider may order other tests to confirm the diagnosis. The health care provider also will look for the cause of the condition, such as an underlying illness.\n                \nIntestinal pseudo-obstruction can be difficult to diagnose, especially primary intestinal pseudo-obstruction. As a result, a correct diagnosis may take a long time.\n                \nPhysical Exam\n                \nA physical exam is one of the first things a health care provider may do to help diagnose intestinal pseudo-obstruction. During a physical exam, a health care provider usually\n                \n- examines a persons body  - uses a stethoscope to listen to bodily sounds  - taps on specific areas of the persons body\n                \nMedical History\n                \nThe health care provider will ask a person to provide a medical and family history to help diagnose intestinal pseudo-obstruction.\n                \nImaging Studies\n                \nA health care provider may order the following imaging studies:\n                \n- Abdominal x ray. An x ray is a picture recorded on film or a computer that a technician takes using low-level radiation. The amount of radiation used is small. An x-ray technician takes the x ray at a hospital or an outpatient center, and a radiologista doctor who specializes in medical imaginginterprets the images. A person does not need anesthesia. The person will lie on a table or stand during the x ray. The technician positions the x-ray machine over the abdominal area. The person will hold his or her breath as the technician takes the picture so that the picture will not be blurry. The technician may ask the person to change position for additional pictures. An x ray of the abdominal area will show whether symptoms are due to an intestinal blockage.  - Upper GI series. A health care provider may order an upper GI series to look at the small intestine. An x-ray technician performs the test at a hospital or an outpatient center, and a radiologist interprets the images; the health care provider may give infants and children anesthesia. A person should not eat or drink for 8 hours before the procedure, if possible. During the procedure, the person will stand or sit in front of an x-ray machine and drink barium, a chalky liquid. Infants lie on a table and the technician will give them barium through a tiny tube placed in the nose that runs into the stomach. Barium coats the lining of the small intestine, making signs of obstruction show up more clearly on x rays.  A person may experience bloating and nausea for a short time after the test. Barium liquid in the GI tract causes stools to be white or light colored for several days or longer in people with intestinal pseudo-obstruction. A health care provider will give the person specific instructions about eating and drinking after the test.  - Lower GI series. A health care provider may order a lower GI series, an x-ray exam to look at the large intestine. An x-ray technician performs the test at a hospital or an outpatient center, and a radiologist interprets the images. A person does not need anesthesia. The health care provider may provide written bowel prep instructions to follow at home before the test. The health care provider may ask the person to follow a clear liquid diet for 1 to 3 days before the procedure. A person may need to use a laxative or an enema before the test. A laxative is medication that loosens stool and increases bowel movements. An enema involves flushing water or laxative into the anus using a special squirt bottle.  For the test, the person will lie on a table while the health care provider inserts a flexible tube into the persons anus. The health care provider will fill the large intestine with barium, making signs of underlying problems show up more clearly on x rays. The test can show problems with the large intestine that are causing the persons symptoms.  Barium liquid in the GI tract causes stools to be white or light colored for several days or longer in people with intestinal pseudo-obstruction. Enemas and repeated bowel movements may cause anal soreness. A health care provider will provide specific instructions about eating and drinking after the test.  - Computerized tomography (CT) scan. CT scans use a combination of x rays and computer technology to create images. An x-ray technician performs the test at a hospital or an outpatient center, and a radiologist interprets the images. For a CT scan, a health care provider may give the person a solution to drink and an injection of a special dye, called contrast medium. CT scans require the person to lie on a table that slides into a tunnel-shaped device where the technician takes the x rays. CT scans can show both the internal and external obstructions.  - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI is a technique that produces detailed pictures of organs and tissues in the body, such as the intestines. An x-ray technician performs the test at a hospital or an outpatient center, and a radiologist interprets the images. A person does not need anesthesia. The test requires the person to lie on a table that slides into a tunnel-shaped device where the technician takes the images. An MRI can show problems with the muscles in the intestines.  - Gastric emptying study. This test measures how fast food moves from the stomach to the small intestine. A health care provider may order this test to determine if gastroparesisdelayed stomach emptyingis contributing to the persons symptoms. A person eats a meal containing a small amount of radioactive material that shows up on the images. A special camera records the rate of gastric emptying by detecting the pattern of radioactive material.  - Antroduodenal manometry. This test measures the muscle contractions of the small intestine. A health care provider may order this test to evaluate the function of the small intestine. A person swallows a thin tube with a balloon on the end. The tube is connected to a device that measures the muscle contractions of the small intestine. The person will lie on their side while the technician performs the test.  - Full-thickness biopsy. In some cases, a health care provider may recommend a full-thickness biopsy to examine the layers of tissue in the intestinal wall. A surgeon performs the test in a hospital, and a pathologist examines the tissue samples. A person needs general anesthesia for the test. The surgeon makes an incision in the abdomen and removes a piece of tissue from the intestinal wall. The pathologist looks for abnormalities in the tissue layers under a microscope.  Blood Tests\n                \nA health care provider may perform blood tests to rule out other conditions that may cause similar symptoms, such as thyroid disease or vitamin deficiencies.\n                \nOther Tests\n                \nA health care provider may order other tests to confirm the diagnosis, such as\n                \n- Urine tests to check for urinary tract infections or kidney stones  - Electrolyte level tests to check for dehydration or electrolyte imbalances  - Complete blood count to check for infection or inflammation\n                \nThe health care provider also will look for the cause of the condition, such as an underlying illness.\n                \nDiagnosing Primary Intestinal Pseudo-obstruction\n                \nDiagnosing primary intestinal pseudo-obstruction can be challenging because many of its symptoms are similar to those",

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: What are the treatments for Intestinal Pseudo-obstruction?\n\n    Reference Answer: A health care provider will treat intestinal pseudo-obstruction with nutritional support, medications, and, in some cases, decompression. Rarely, a person will need surgery. If an illness, a medication, or both cause intestinal pseudo-obstruction, a health care provider will treat the underlying illness, stop the medication, or do both.\n                \nNutritional Support\n                \nPeople with intestinal pseudo-obstruction often need nutritional support to prevent malnutrition and weight loss. Enteral nutrition provides liquid food through a feeding tube inserted through the nose into the stomach or placed directly into the stomach or small intestine. A health care provider inserts the feeding tube, sometimes using x ray or endoscopy for guidance, and teaches the person how to care for the tube after returning home. Enteral nutrition is sufficient for most people with intestinal pseudo-obstruction. In a severe case, a person may need IV feeding, also called parenteral nutrition, which provides liquid food through a tube placed in a vein.\n                \nEnteral nutrition is possible because the intestinal lining is normal in most people with intestinal pseudo-obstruction. Enteral nutrition is preferred over parenteral nutrition because it has a much lower risk of complications.\n                \nMedications\n                \nA health care provider prescribes medications to treat the different symptoms and complications of intestinal pseudo-obstruction, such as\n                \n- antibiotics to treat bacterial infections  - pain medication, which should be used sparingly, if at all, because most pain medications delay intestinal transit  - medication to make intestinal muscles contract  - antinausea medications  - antidiarrheal medications  - laxatives\n                \nDecompression\n                \nA person with acute colonic pseudo-obstruction and a greatly enlarged colon who does not respond to medications may need a procedure, called decompression, to remove gas from the colon. A gastroenterologist can perform the procedure in a hospital or an outpatient center. The gastroenterologist may choose to decompress the colon by using colonoscopy. During colonoscopy, the gastroenterologist inserts a flexible tube into the colon through the anus. A health care provider gives the person a light sedative, and possibly pain medication, to relax. If the person requires long-term decompression, the gastroenterologist also can decompress the colon through a surgical opening in the cecum. In this case, the health care provider gives the person local anesthesia.\n                \nSurgery\n                \nIn severe cases of intestinal pseudo-obstruction, a person may need surgery to remove part of the intestine. However, surgery should be performed rarely, if at all,...\n\n    Generated Answer: Intestinal pseudo-obstruction is a condition that can be challenging to treat. Treatment options may include:\n\n1. Medications: Your doctor may prescribe medications to stimulate muscle contractions in the intestines, such as metoclopramide, erythromycin, or cisapride.\n2. Dietary changes: Eating smaller, more frequent meals and avoiding high-fiber foods may help reduce symptoms.\n3. Decompression: If you have a blockage in your intestines, your doctor may use a tube to remove the blockage and relieve...\n\n    Scoring guide:\n    1.

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: How to diagnose Dumping Syndrome?\n\n    Reference Answer: A health care provider will diagnose dumping syndrome primarily on the basis of symptoms. A scoring system helps differentiate dumping syndrome from other GI problems. The scoring system assigns points to each symptom and the total points result in a score. A person with a score above 7 likely has dumping syndrome.\n                \nThe following tests may confirm dumping syndrome and exclude other conditions with similar symptoms:\n                \n- A modified oral glucose tolerance test checks how well insulin works with tissues to absorb glucose. A health care provider performs the test during an office visit or in a commercial facility and sends the blood samples to a lab for analysis. The person should fasteat or drink nothing except waterfor at least 8 hours before the test. The health care provider will measure blood glucose concentration, hematocritthe amount of red blood cells in the bloodpulse rate, and blood pressure before the test begins. After the initial measurements, the person drinks a glucose solution. The health care provider repeats the initial measurements immediately and at 30-minute intervals for up to 180 minutes. A health care provider often confirms dumping syndrome in people with      - low blood sugar between 120 and 180 minutes after drinking the solution    - an increase in hematocrit of more than 3 percent at 30 minutes    - a rise in pulse rate of more than 10 beats per minute after 30 minutes     - A gastric emptying scintigraphy test involves eating a bland mealsuch as eggs or an egg substitutethat contains a small amount of radioactive material. A specially trained technician performs this test in a radiology center or hospital, and a radiologista doctor who specializes in medical imaginginterprets the results. Anesthesia is not needed. An external camera scans the abdomen to locate the radioactive material. The radiologist measures the rate of gastric emptying at 1, 2, 3, and 4 hours after the meal. The test can help confirm a diagnosis of dumping syndrome.\n                \n- An upper GI endoscopy involves using an endoscopea small, flexible tube with a lightto see the upper GI tract. A gastroenterologista doctor who specializes in digestive diseasesperforms the test at a hospital or an outpatient center. The gastroenterologist carefully feeds the endoscope down the esophagus and into the stomach and duodenum. A small camera mounted on the endoscope transmits a video image to a monitor, allowing close examination of the intestinal lining. A person may receive general anesthesia or a liquid anesthetic that is gargled or sprayed on the back of the throat. If the person receives general anesthesia, a health care provider will place an intravenous (IV) needle in a vein in the arm. The test may show ulcers, swelling of the stomach lining, or cancer.   - An upper GI series examines the small intestine. An...\n\n    Generated Answer: Dumping Syndrome is typically diagnosed through a combination of medical history, physical examination, and testing. The doctor may ask about symptoms, eating habits, and medical history....\n\n    Scoring guide:\n    1. Scientific Consensus: 1=Aligned, 0=No consensus, -1=Opposed\n    2.

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: What causes Irritable Bowel Syndrome in Children?\n\n    Reference Answer: The causes of IBS are not well understood. Researchers believe a combination of physical and mental health problems can lead to IBS. The possible causes of IBS in children include the following:\n                \n- Brain-gut signal problems. Signals between the brain and nerves of the small and large intestines, also called the gut, control how the intestines work. Problems with brain-gut signals may cause IBS symptoms, such as changes in bowel habits and pain or discomfort.  - GI motor problems. Normal motility, or movement, may not be present in the colon of a child who has IBS. Slow motility can lead to constipation and fast motility can lead to diarrhea. Spasms, or sudden strong muscle contractions that come and go, can cause abdominal pain. Some children with IBS also experience hyperreactivity, which is an excessive increase in contractions of the bowel in response to stress or eating.  - Hypersensitivity. Children with IBS have greater sensitivity to abdominal pain than children without IBS. Affected children have been found to have different rectal tone and rectal motor response after eating a meal.  - Mental health problems. IBS has been linked to mental health, or psychological, problems such as anxiety and depression in children.  - Bacterial gastroenteritis. Some children who have bacterial gastroenteritisan infection or irritation of the stomach and intestines caused by bacteriadevelop IBS. Research has shown a connection between gastroenteritis and IBS in adults but not in children. But researchers believe postinfectious IBS does occur in children. Researchers do not know why gastroenteritis leads to IBS in some people and not others.  - Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). Normally, few bacteria live in the small intestine. SIBO is an increase in the number of bacteria or a change in the type of bacteria in the small intestine. These bacteria can produce excess gas and may also cause diarrhea and weight loss. Some researchers...\n\n    Generated Answer: The exact cause of Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) in children is not fully understood. However, several factors may contribute to its development, including:\n\n1. Intestinal sensitivity: Some children may have a more sensitive digestive system, making them more prone to experiencing symptoms after eating certain foods or when under stress.\n2. Gut motility issues: Problems with muscle contractions in the intestines can lead to irregular bowel movements, either too fast (diarrhea) or too slow (constipation).\n3. Bacterial or viral infections: In some cases, IBS symptoms can develop after a gastrointestinal infection, also known as post-infectious IBS.\n4. Food intolerances or sensitivities: Certain foods or food additives may...\n\n    Scoring guide:\n    1. Scientific Consensus: 1=Aligned, 0=No consensus, -1=Opposed\n    2.

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: How to diagnose Irritable Bowel Syndrome in Children?\n\n    Reference Answer: To diagnose IBS, a health care provider will conduct a physical exam and take a complete medical history. The medical history will include questions about the childs symptoms, family members with GI disorders, recent infections, medications, and stressful events related to the onset of symptoms. IBS is diagnosed when the physical exam does not show any cause for the childs symptoms and the child meets all of the following criteria:\n                \n- has had symptoms at least once per week for at least 2 months  - is growing as expected  - is not showing any signs that suggest another cause for the symptoms\n                \nFurther testing is not usually needed, though the health care provider may do a blood test to screen for other problems. Additional diagnostic tests may be needed based on the results of the screening blood test and for children who also have signs such as\n                \n- persistent pain in the upper right or lower right area of the abdomen  - joint pain  - pain that wakes them from sleep  - disease in the tissues around the rectum  - difficulty swallowing  - persistent vomiting  - slowed growth rate  - GI bleeding  - delayed puberty  - diarrhea at night\n                \nFurther diagnostic tests may also be needed for children with a family history of\n                \n- inflammatory bowel diseaselong-lasting disorders that cause irritation and ulcers, or sores, in the GI tract  - celiac diseasean immune disease in which people cannot tolerate gluten, a protein found in wheat, rye, and barley, because it will damage the lining of their small intestine and prevent absorption of nutrients  - peptic ulcer diseasea sore in the lining of the esophagus or stomach\n                \nAdditional diagnostic tests may include a stool test, ultrasound, and flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy.\n                \nStool tests. A stool test is the analysis of a sample of stool. The health care provider will give the childs caretaker a container for catching and storing the childs stool. The sample is returned to the health care provider or a commercial facility and sent to a lab for analysis. The health care provider may also do a rectal exam, sometimes during the physical exam, to check for blood in the stool. Stool tests can show the presence of parasites or blood.\n                \nUltrasound. Ultrasound uses a device, called a transducer, that bounces safe, painless sound waves off organs to create an image of their structure. The procedure is performed in a health care providers office, outpatient center, or hospital by a specially trained technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologista doctor who specializes in medical imaging; anesthesia is not needed. The images can show problems in the GI tract causing pain or other symptoms.\n                \nFlexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy. The tests are similar, but a colonoscopy is used to view the rectum and entire colon, while a flexible sigmoidoscopy is used to view just the rectum and lower colon. These tests are performed at a hospital or outpatient center by a gastroenterologista doctor who specializes in digestive diseases. For both tests, a health care provider will give written bowel prep instructions to follow at home. The child may be asked to follow a clear liquid diet for 1 to 3 days before either test. The night before the test, the child may need to take a laxative. One or more enemas may also be required the night before and about 2 hours before the test.\n                \nIn most cases, light anesthesia, and possibly pain medication, helps the child relax. For either test, the child will lie on a table while the gastroenterologist inserts a flexible tube into the anus. A small camera on the tube sends a video image of the intestinal lining to a...\n\n    Generated Answer: Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) in children is typically diagnosed by a combination of symptoms, medical history, and ruling out other conditions. Here are the general steps:\n\n1. The child should have recurrent abdominal pain or discomfort for at least 1 day a week in the last 2 months.\n2. The pain or discomfort should be associated with two or more of the following: improvement after a bowel movement, onset associated with a change in frequency of stool, or onset associated with a...\n\n    Scoring guide:\n    1.

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: What to do for Irritable Bowel Syndrome in Children?\n\n    Reference Answer: Large meals can cause cramping and diarrhea, so eating smaller meals more often, or eating smaller portions, may help IBS symptoms. Eating meals that are low in fat and high in carbohydrates, such as pasta, rice, whole-grain breads and cereals, fruits, and vegetables may help.\n                \nCertain foods and drinks may cause IBS symptoms in some children, such as\n                \n- foods high in fat  - milk products  - drinks with caffeine  - drinks with large amounts of artificial sweeteners, which are substances used in place of sugar  - foods that may cause gas, such as beans and cabbage\n                \nChildren with IBS may want to limit or avoid these foods. Keeping a food diary is a good way to track which foods cause symptoms so they can be excluded from or reduced in the diet.\n                \nDietary fiber may lessen constipation in children with IBS, but it may not help with lowering pain. Fiber helps keep stool soft so it moves smoothly through the colon. The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics recommends children consume age plus 5 grams of fiber daily. A 7-year-old child, for example, should get 7 plus 5, or 12 grams, of fiber a day.3 Fiber may cause gas and trigger symptoms in some children with IBS. Increasing fiber intake by 2 to 3 grams per day may help reduce the risk of increased gas and bloating.\n                \nMedications\n                \nThe health care provider will select medications based on the childs symptoms. Caregivers should not give children any medications unless told to do so by a health care provider.\n                \n- Fiber supplements. Fiber supplements may be recommended to relieve constipation when increasing dietary fiber is ineffective.  - Laxatives. Constipation can be treated with laxative medications. Laxatives work in different ways, and a health care provider can provide information about which type is best. Caregivers should not give children laxatives unless told to do so by a health care provider. More information about different types of laxatives is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Constipation.  - Antidiarrheals. Loperamide has been found to reduce diarrhea in children with IBS, though it does not reduce pain, bloating, or other symptoms. Loperamide reduces stool frequency and improves stool consistency by slowing the movement of stool through the colon. Medications to treat diarrhea in adults can be dangerous for infants and children and should only be given if told to do so by a health care provider.  - Antispasmodics. Antispasmodics, such as hyoscine, cimetropium, and pinaverium, help to control colon muscle spasms and reduce abdominal pain.  - Antidepressants. Tricyclic antidepressants and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in low doses can help relieve IBS symptoms including abdominal pain. These medications are thought to reduce the perception of pain, improve mood and sleep patterns, and adjust the activity of the GI tract.\n                \nProbiotics\n                \nProbiotics are live microorganisms, usually bacteria, that are similar to microorganisms normally found in the GI tract. Studies have found that probiotics, specifically Bifidobacteria and certain probiotic combinations, improve symptoms of IBS when taken in large enough amounts. But more research is needed. Probiotics can be found in dietary supplements, such as capsules, tablets, and powders, and in some foods, such as yogurt. A health care provider can give information about the right kind and right amount of probiotics to take to improve IBS symptoms. More information about probiotics can be found in the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine fact sheet An Introduction to Probiotics.\n                \nTherapies for Mental Health Problems\n                \nThe following therapies can help improve IBS symptoms due to mental health problems:\n                \n- Talk therapy. Talking with a therapist may reduce stress and improve IBS symptoms. Two types of talk therapy used to...\n\n    Generated Answer: Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) in children can cause discomfort and affect their daily activities. While there is no cure for IBS, there are ways to manage the symptoms:\n\n1. Diet: Encourage your child to eat a balanced diet with plenty of fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains. Some children may benefit from eliminating certain foods that trigger symptoms, such as dairy, gluten, or gas-producing foods like beans and broccoli.\n\n2. Hydration: Make sure your child drinks plenty of water throughout the day.\n\n3. Regular Exercise: Encourage your child to get regular physical activity, as this can help relieve symptoms.\n\n4.

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: How to diagnose Gastroparesis?\n\n    Reference Answer: Gastroparesis is diagnosed through a physical exam, medical history, blood tests, tests to rule out blockage or structural problems in the GI tract, and gastric emptying tests. Tests may also identify a nutritional disorder or underlying disease. To rule out any blockage or other structural problems, the health care provider may perform one or more of the following tests:\n                \n- Upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy. This procedure involves using an endoscopea small, flexible tube with a lightto see the upper GI tract, which includes the esophagus, stomach, and duodenumthe first part of the small intestine. The test is performed at a hospital or outpatient center by a gastroenterologista doctor who specializes in digestive diseases. The endoscope is carefully fed down the esophagus and into the stomach and duodenum. A small camera mounted on the endoscope transmits a video image to a monitor, allowing close examination of the intestinal lining. A person may receive a liquid anesthetic that is gargled or sprayed on the back of the throat. An intravenous (IV) needle is placed in a vein in the arm if general anesthesia is given. The test may show blockage or large bezoarssolid collections of food, mucus, vegetable fiber, hair, or other material that cannot be digested in the stomachthat are sometimes softened, dissolved, or broken up during an upper GI endoscopy.  - Upper GI series. An upper GI series may be done to look at the small intestine. The test is performed at a hospital or outpatient center by an x-ray technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologista doctor who specializes in medical imaging. Anesthesia is not needed. No eating or drinking is allowed for 8 hours before the procedure, if possible. If the person has diabetes, a health care provider may give different instructions about fasting before the test. During the procedure, the person will stand or sit in front of an x-ray machine and drink barium, a chalky liquid. Barium coats the small intestine, making signs of gastroparesis show up more clearly on x rays. Gastroparesis is likely if the x ray shows food in the stomach after fasting. A person may experience bloating and nausea for a short time after the test. For several days afterward, barium liquid in the GI tract causes stools to be white or light colored. A health care provider will give the person specific instructions about eating and drinking after the test.  - Ultrasound. Ultrasound uses a device, called a transducer, that bounces safe, painless sound waves off organs to create an image of their structure. The procedure is performed in a health care providers office, outpatient center, or hospital by a specially trained technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologist; anesthesia is not needed. The images can show whether gallbladder disease and pancreatitis could be the cause of a persons digestive symptoms, rather than gastroparesis.  - Gastric emptying scintigraphy. The test involves eating a bland mealsuch as eggs or an egg substitutethat contains a small amount of radioactive material. The test is performed in a radiology center or hospital by a specially trained technician and interpreted by a radiologist; anesthesia is not needed. An external camera scans the abdomen to show where the radioactive material is located. The radiologist is then able to measure the rate of gastric emptying at 1, 2, 3, and 4 hours after the meal. If more than 10 percent of the meal is still in the stomach at 4 hours, the diagnosis of gastroparesis is confirmed.  - SmartPill. The SmartPill is a small electronic device in capsule form. The SmartPill test is available at specialized outpatient centers. The images are interpreted by a radiologist. The device is swallowed and moves through the entire digestive tract, sending information to a cell-phone-sized receiver worn around the persons waist or neck.

            "raw_response": "Evaluate this medical answer based on the criteria below. Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: What to do for Gastroparesis?\n\n    Reference Answer: Changing eating habits can sometimes help control the severity of gastroparesis symptoms. A health care provider may suggest eating six small meals a day instead of three large ones. If less food enters the stomach each time a person eats, the stomach may not become overly full, allowing it to empty more easily. Chewing food well, drinking noncarbonated liquids with a meal, and walking or sitting for 2 hours after a mealinstead of lying downmay assist with gastric emptying.\n                \nA health care provider may also recommend avoiding high-fat and fibrous foods. Fat naturally slows digestion and some raw vegetables and fruits are more difficult to digest than other foods. Some foods, such as oranges and broccoli, contain fibrous parts that do not digest well. People with gastroparesis should minimize their intake of large portions of these foods because the undigested parts may remain in the stomach too long. Sometimes, the undigested parts form bezoars.\n                \nWhen a person has severe symptoms, a liquid or pured diet may be prescribed. As liquids tend to empty more quickly from the stomach, some people may find a pured diet helps improve symptoms. Pured fresh or cooked fruits and vegetables can be incorporated into shakes and soups. A health care provider may recommend a dietitian to help a person plan meals that minimize symptoms and ensure all nutritional needs are met.\n                \nWhen the most extreme cases of gastroparesis lead to severe nausea, vomiting, and dehydration, urgent care may be required at a medical facility where IV fluids can be given.\n                \n\n                \nMedications\n                \nSeveral prescription medications are available to treat gastroparesis. A combination of medications may be used to find the most effective treatment.\n                \nMetoclopramide (Reglan). This medication stimulates stomach muscle contractions to help with gastric emptying. Metoclopramide also helps reduce nausea and vomiting. The medication is taken 20 to 30 minutes before meals and at bedtime. Possible side effects of metoclopramide include fatigue, sleepiness, and depression. Currently, this is the only medication approved by the FDA for treatment of gastroparesis. However, the FDA has placed a black box warning on this medication because of rare reports of it causing an irreversible neurologic side effect called tardive dyskinesiaa disorder that affects movement.\n                \nErythromycin. This antibiotic, prescribed at low doses, may improve gastric emptying. Like metaclopramide, erythromycin works by increasing the contractions that move food through the stomach. Possible side effects of erythromycin include nausea, vomiting, and abdominal cramps.\n                \nOther medications. Other medications may be used to treat symptoms and problems related to gastroparesis. For example, medications known as antiemetics are used to help control nausea and vomiting.\n                \nBotulinum Toxin\n                \nBotulinum toxin is a nerve blocking agent also known as Botox. After passing an endoscope into the stomach, a health care provider injects the Botox into the pylorus, the opening from the stomach into the duodenum. Botox is supposed to help keep the pylorus open for longer periods of time and improve symptoms of gastroparesis. Although some initial research trials showed modest improvement in gastroparesis symptoms and the rate of gastric emptying following the injections, other studies have failed to show the same degree of effectiveness of the Botox injections.1\n                \nGastric Electrical Stimulation\n                \nThis treatment alternative may be effective for some people whose nausea and vomiting do not improve with dietary changes or medications. A gastric neurostimulator is a surgically implanted battery-operated device that sends mild electrical pulses to the stomach muscles to help control nausea and vomiting. The procedure may be performed at a hospital or outpatient center by a gastroenterologist. General anesthesia may be required. The gastroenterologist makes several tiny incisions in the abdomen and inserts a laparoscopea thin tube with a tiny video camera attached. The camera sends a magnified image from inside the stomach to a video monitor, giving the gastroenterologist a close-up view of the tissues. Once implanted, the settings on the battery-operated device can be adjusted to determine the settings that best control symptoms.\n                \nJejunostomy\n                \nIf medications and dietary changes dont work, and the person is losing weight or requires frequent hospitalization for dehydration, a health care provider may recommend surgically placing a feeding tube through the abdominal wall directly into a part of the small intestine called the jejunum. The surgical procedure is known as a jejunostomy. The procedure is performed by a surgeon at a hospital or outpatient center. Anesthesia is needed. The feeding tube bypasses the stomach and delivers a special liquid food with nutrients directly into the jejunum. The jejunostomy is used only when gastroparesis is severe and does not respond to other treatments.\n                \nPyloroplasty\n                \nIn some cases, a health care provider may recommend surgery to widen the pyloric channelthe passage between the stomach and the first portion of the small intestine. The procedure is known as pyloroplasty. The goal of the surgery is to improve the flow of food from the stomach into the small intestine. The surgery is usually performed under general anesthesia by a surgeon at a hospital or outpatient center. The surgeon makes a cut in the upper abdomen and then cuts across the pyloric sphincter muscle to widen the pyloric channel. The widened channel allows food to pass more easily from the stomach into the small intestine. The surgery may be performed using a laparoscopea thin tube with a tiny video camera attached. The camera sends a magnified image from inside the abdomen to a video monitor, giving the surgeon a close-up view of the tissues. The laparoscopic approach involves making several tiny incisions in the abdomen instead of one larger incision.\n                \nBariatric Surgery\n                \nSome people with obesity and gastroparesis may benefit from bariatric surgery. Bariatric surgery is a type of surgery that reduces the size of the stomach, limiting the amount of food it can hold. The surgery may help improve symptoms of gastroparesis by reducing the volume of food entering the stomach and thereby decreasing the pressure on the stomach muscles. Gastric sleeve surgery, which removes a significant portion of the stomach, may be particularly beneficial for people with gastroparesis who have obesity. Gastric bypass surgery, which creates a new pathway for food to enter the small intestine, may also be considered. Both types of surgery require careful consideration and consultation with a qualified healthcare professional.\n                \nNutritional Support\n                \nPeople with gastroparesis often experience malnutrition due to inadequate nutrient absorption. Nutritional support is essential to prevent malnutrition and promote overall health. A registered dietitian can provide personalized guidance on nutrition and meal planning to help manage gastroparesis symptoms and ensure adequate nutrient intake. In some cases, enteral nutrition may be necessary, where a feeding tube is inserted into the stomach or small intestine to deliver nutrients directly into the digestive system. Parenteral nutrition, where nutrients are delivered intravenously, may also be considered in severe cases of malnutrition.\n                \nAlternative Therapies\n                \nAcupuncture, acupressure, ginger, and peppermint oil capsules have been suggested as possible complementary therapies for managing gastroparesis symptoms.

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: What causes Fecal Incontinence?\n\n    Reference Answer: Fecal incontinence has many causes, including\n                \n- diarrhea  - constipation  - muscle damage or weakness  - nerve damage  - loss of stretch in the rectum  - childbirth by vaginal delivery  - hemorrhoids and rectal prolapse  - rectocele  - inactivity\n                \nDiarrhea\n                \nDiarrhea can cause fecal incontinence. Loose stools fill the rectum quickly and are more difficult to hold than solid stools. Diarrhea increases the chance of not reaching a bathroom in time.\n                \nConstipation\n                \nConstipation can lead to large, hard stools that stretch the rectum and cause the internal sphincter muscles to relax by reflex. Watery stool builds up behind the hard stool and may leak out around the hard stool, leading to fecal incontinence.\n                \nThe type of constipation that is most likely to lead to fecal incontinence occurs when people are unable to relax their external sphincter and pelvic floor muscles when straining to have a bowel movement, often mistakenly squeezing these muscles instead of relaxing them. This squeezing makes it difficult to pass stool and may lead to a large amount of stool in the rectum. This type of constipation, called dyssynergic defecation or disordered defecation, is a result of faulty learning. For example, children or adults who have pain when having a bowel movement may unconsciously learn to squeeze their muscles to delay the bowel movement and avoid pain.\n                \nMuscle Damage or Weakness\n                \nInjury to one or both of the sphincter muscles can cause fecal incontinence. If these muscles, called the external and internal anal sphincter muscles, are damaged or weakened, they may not be strong enough to keep the anus closed and prevent stool from leaking.\n                \nTrauma, childbirth injuries, cancer surgery, and hemorrhoid surgery are possible causes of injury to the sphincters. Hemorrhoids are swollen blood vessels in and around the anus and lower rectum.\n                \nNerve Damage\n                \nThe anal sphincter muscles wont open and close properly if the nerves that control them are damaged. Likewise, if the nerves that sense stool in the rectum are damaged, a person may not feel the urge to go to the bathroom. Both types of nerve damage can lead to fecal incontinence. Possible sources of nerve damage are childbirth; a long-term habit of straining to pass stool; spinal cord injury; and diseases, such as diabetes and multiple sclerosis, that affect the nerves that go to the sphincter muscles and rectum. Brain injuries from stroke, head trauma, or certain diseases can also cause fecal incontinence.\n                \nLoss of Stretch in the Rectum\n                \nNormally, the rectum stretches to hold stool until a person has a bowel movement. Rectal surgery, radiation treatment, and inflammatory bowel diseaseschronic disorders that cause irritation and sores on the lining of the digestive systemcan cause the rectal walls to become stiff. The rectum then cant stretch as much to hold stool, increasing the risk of fecal incontinence.\n                \nChildbirth by Vaginal Delivery\n                \nChildbirth sometimes causes injuries to muscles and nerves in the pelvic floor. The risk is greater if forceps are used to help deliver the baby or if an episiotomya cut in the vaginal area to prevent the babys head from tearing the vagina during birthis performed. Fecal incontinence related to childbirth can appear soon after delivery or many years later.\n                \nHemorrhoids and Rectal Prolapse\n                \nExternal hemorrhoids, which develop under the skin around the anus, can prevent the anal sphincter muscles from closing completely. Rectal prolapse, a condition that causes the rectum to drop down through the anus, can also prevent the anal sphincter muscles from closing well enough to prevent leakage. Small amounts of mucus or liquid stool can then leak through the anus.\n                \nRectocele\n                \nRectocele is a condition that causes the rectum to protrude through the vagina. Rectocele can happen when the thin layer of muscles separating the rectum from the vagina becomes weak. For women with rectocele, straining to have a bowel movement may be less effective because rectocele reduces the amount of downward force through the anus. The result may be retention...\n\n    Generated Answer: Fecal incontinence, or the inability to control bowel movements, can be caused by several factors. These may include:\n\n1. Damage to the muscles or nerves of the anus or rectum due to...\n\n    Scoring guide:\n    1. Scientific Consensus: 1=Aligned, 0=No consensus, -1=Opposed\n    2.

            "raw_response": "Evaluate this medical answer based on the criteria below. Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: How to diagnose Fecal Incontinence?\n\n    Reference Answer: Health care providers diagnose fecal incontinence based on a persons medical history, physical exam, and medical test results. In addition to a general medical history, the health care provider may ask the following questions:\n                \n- When did fecal incontinence start?  - How often does fecal incontinence occur?  - How much stool leaks? Does the stool just streak the underwear? Does just a little bit of solid or liquid stool leak out or does complete loss of bowel control occur?  - Does fecal incontinence involve a strong urge to have a bowel movement or does it happen without warning?  - For people with hemorrhoids, do hemorrhoids bulge through the anus? Do the hemorrhoids pull back in by themselves, or do they have to be pushed in with a finger?  - How does fecal incontinence affect daily life?  - Is fecal incontinence worse after eating? Do certain foods seem to make fecal incontinence worse?  - Can passing gas be controlled?\n                \nPeople may want to keep a stool diary for several weeks before their appointment so they can answer these questions. A stool diary is a chart for recording daily bowel movement details. A sample stool diary is available on the Bowel Control Awareness Campaign website at www.bowelcontrol.nih.gov.\n                \nThe person may be referred to a doctor who specializes in problems of the digestive system, such as a gastroenterologist, proctologist, or colorectal surgeon, or a doctor who specializes in problems of the urinary and reproductive systems, such as a urologist or urogynecologist. The specialist will perform a physical exam and may suggest one or more of the following tests:\n                \n- anal manometry  - anal ultrasound  - magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)  - defecography  - flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy  - anal electromyography (EMG)\n                \nAnal manometry. Anal manometry uses pressure sensors and a balloon that can be inflated in the rectum to check the sensitivity and function of the rectum. Anal manometry also checks the tightness of the anal sphincter muscles around the anus. To prepare for this test, the person should use an enema and not eat anything 2 hours before the test. An enema involves flushing water or a laxative into the anus using a special squirt bottle. A laxative is medication that loosens stool and increases bowel movements. For this test, a thin tube with a balloon on its tip and pressure sensors below the balloon is inserted into the anus until the balloon is in the rectum and pressure sensors are located in the anal canal. The tube is slowly pulled back through the sphincter muscle to measure muscle tone and contractions. No anesthesia is needed for this test, which takes about 30 minutes.\n                \nAnal ultrasound. Ultrasound uses a device, called a transducer, that bounces safe, painless sound waves off organs to create an image of their structure. An anal ultrasound is specific to the anus and rectum. The procedure is performed in a health care providers office, outpatient center, or hospital by a specially trained technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologista doctor who specializes in medical imaging. Anesthesia is not needed. The images can show the structure of the anal sphincter muscles.\n                \nMRI. MRI machines use radio waves and magnets to produce detailed pictures of the bodys internal organs and soft tissues without using x rays. The procedure is performed in an outpatient center or hospital by a specially trained technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologist. Anesthesia is not needed, though people with a fear of confined spaces may be given medication to help them relax. An MRI may include the injection of special dye, called contrast medium. With most MRI machines, the person lies on a table that slides into a tunnel-shaped device that may be open ended or closed at one end; some newer machines are designed to allow the person to lie in a more open space. MRIs can show problems with the anal sphincter muscles. MRI is an alternative to anal ultrasound that may provide more detailed information, especially about the external anal sphincter.\n                \nDefecography. This x ray of the area around the anus and rectum shows how well the person can hold and evacuate stool. The test also identifies structural changes in the rectum and anus such as rectocele and rectal prolapse. To prepare for the test, the person uses two enemas and does not eat anything 2 hours prior to the test. During the test, the health care provider fills the rectum with a soft paste that shows up on x rays and is the same consistency as stool. The person sits on a toilet inside an x-ray machine. The person is first asked to pull in and squeeze the sphincter muscles to prevent leakage and then to push the paste out as if having a bowel movement. X rays are taken during the squeezing and pushing actions. Defecography can take from 30 minutes to several hours to complete.\n                \nFlexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy. These tests are used to rule out other conditions that might cause similar symptoms. Both procedures involve inserting a flexible tube with a camera and light on the end into the anus to look at the lining of the lower gastrointestinal tract. Flexible sigmoidoscopy looks at the rectum and the sigmoid colon, while colonoscopy looks at the entire colon. The person is usually sedated during these tests. The health care provider performs the test in an outpatient center or hospital. People should talk with their health care provider about preparing for either test.\n                \nAnal EMG. An anal EMG measures the nerve damage to the muscles of the pelvic floor. Two small electrodes are placed next to the anus to record the electrical activity of the muscles during rest, squeezing, coughing, and pushing. The test can determine the extent of the nerve damage, which helps guide treatment decisions. The test takes only a few minutes and causes minimal discomfort.\n                \nAfter diagnosing fecal incontinence, the health care provider will develop a treatment plan to help manage the condition.",

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: What to do for Fecal Incontinence?\n\n    Reference Answer: Dietary changes that may improve fecal incontinence include\n                \n- Eating the right amount of fiber. Fiber can help with diarrhea and constipation. Fiber is found in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and beans. Fiber supplements sold in a pharmacy or in a health food store are another common source of fiber to treat fecal incontinence. The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics recommends consuming 20 to 35 grams of fiber a day for adults and age plus five grams for children. A 7-year-old child, for example, should get 7 plus five, or 12, grams of fiber a day. American adults consume only 15 grams a day on average.2 Fiber should be added to the diet slowly to avoid bloating.  - Getting plenty to drink. Drinking eight 8-ounce glasses of liquid a day may help prevent constipation. Water is a good choice. Drinks with caffeine, alcohol, milk, or carbonation should be avoided if they trigger diarrhea.\n                \nKeeping a Food Diary   A food diary can help identify foods that cause diarrhea and increase the risk of fecal incontinence. A food diary should list foods eaten, portion size, and when fecal incontinence occurs. After a few days, the diary may show a link between certain foods and fecal incontinence. Eating less of foods linked to fecal incontinence may improve symptoms. A food diary can also be helpful to a health care provider treating a person with fecal incontinence.   Common foods and drinks linked to fecal incontinence include   - dairy products such as milk, cheese, and ice cream   - drinks and foods containing caffeine   - cured or smoked meat such as sausage, ham, and turkey   - spicy foods   - alcoholic beverages   - fruits such as apples, peaches, and pears   - fatty and greasy foods   - sweeteners in diet drinks and sugarless gum and candy, including sorbitol, xylitol, mannitol, and fructose\n                \n\n                \nExamples of Foods That Have Fiber        Beans, cereals, and breads    Fiber         cup of beans (navy, pinto, kidney, etc.), cooked    6.29.6 grams         cup of shredded wheat, ready-to-eat cereal    2.73.8 grams         cup of 100% bran, ready-to-eat cereal    9.1 grams        1 small oat bran muffin    3.0 grams        1 whole-wheat English muffin    4.4 grams        Fruits        1 small apple, with skin    3.6 grams        1 medium pear, with skin    5.5 grams         cup of raspberries    4.0 grams         cup of stewed prunes    3.8 grams        Vegetables         cup of winter squash, cooked    2.9 grams         1 medium sweet potato, baked in skin    3.8 grams         cup of green peas, cooked    3.54.4 grams        1 small potato, baked, with skin    3.0 grams         cup of mixed vegetables, cooked    4.0 grams         cup of broccoli, cooked    2.62.8 grams          cup of greens (spinach, collards, turnip greens), cooked    2.53.5 grams\n                \n\n                \nMedications\n                \nIf diarrhea is causing fecal incontinence, medication may help. Health care providers sometimes recommend using bulk laxatives, such as Citrucel and Metamucil, to develop more solid stools that are easier to control. Antidiarrheal medications such as loperamide or diphenoxylate may be recommended to slow down the bowels and help control the problem.\n                \nBowel Training\n                \nDeveloping a regular bowel movement pattern can improve fecal incontinence, especially fecal incontinence due to constipation. Bowel training involves trying to have bowel movements at specific times of the day, such as after every meal. Over time, the body becomes used to a regular bowel movement pattern, thus reducing constipation and related fecal incontinence. Persistence is key to successful bowel training. Achieving a regular bowel control pattern can take weeks to months.\n                \nPelvic Floor Exercises and Biofeedback\n                \nExercises that strengthen the pelvic floor muscles may improve bowel control. Pelvic floor exercises involve squeezing and relaxing pelvic floor muscles 50 to 100 times a day. A health care provider can help with proper technique. Biofeedback therapy may also help a person perform the exercises properly. This therapy also improves a persons awareness of sensations in the rectum, teaching how to coordinate squeezing of the external sphincter muscle with the sensation of rectal filling. Biofeedback training uses special sensors to measure bodily functions. Sensors include pressure or EMG sensors placed on the abdomen or inserted into the anus or vagina. The sensors provide information about muscle contractions during exercise. The therapist helps interpret the data from the sensors and provides feedback to the patient. Biofeedback therapy is usually done by a specially trained physical therapist or nurse practitioner. It may require one to three sessions per week for several months.\n                \nElectrical Stimulation\n                \nElectrical stimulation involves using low-voltage electric currents to stimulate muscle contractions. Electrical stimulation can be applied through an anal electrode device inserted into the anus. The treatment is provided in a clinic setting once a week for six to 12 months. Home devices are also available. Electrical stimulation has been shown to improve continence in people who have not responded to other treatments.\n                \nSurgery\n                \nSurgical procedures may be considered for people with severe fecal incontinence who have not improved with other treatments. Surgical options include\n                \n- Sphincteroplasty. This procedure repairs or replaces the damaged anal sphincter muscles.\n                \n- Colostomy. This procedure brings part of the colon through an opening in the abdominal wall to create a new path for waste to leave the body. The opening is called a stoma. A pouch is attached over the stoma to collect waste. The pouch must be emptied regularly throughout the day.\n                \n- Artificial bowel sphincter. This procedure involves placing an artificial ring around the anus to keep it closed until the person is ready to release stool. The ring is filled with fluid that can be inflated or deflated as needed.\n                \n- Sacral nerve stimulation. This procedure involves implanting a device that delivers low-voltage electrical pulses to the sacral nerves, which run from the lower back to the anus. The pulses can strengthen the anal sphincter muscles and improve continence.\n                \n- Bowel diversion. This procedure involves diverting the normal flow of stool to allow the affected area of the anus to heal. The diverted stool is collected in a pouch attached to an opening in the abdominal wall.\n                \n- Gracilis muscle transposition. This procedure involves moving a muscle from the thigh to wrap around the anus to replace damaged muscles.\n                \n- Dynamic graciloplasty. This procedure involves taking a muscle from the leg and wrapping it around the anus to create a new anal sphincter muscle. The muscle is stimulated by electrodes implanted under the skin.\n                \n- Secca procedure. This procedure involves removing a portion of the large intestine to reduce the frequency of bowel movements.\n                \n- Malone antegrade continent enema (M",

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: How to diagnose Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome?\n\n    Reference Answer: A specific test to diagnose cyclic vomiting syndrome does not exist; instead, a health care provider will rule out other conditions and diagnose the syndrome based upon\n                \n- a medical and family history  - a physical exam  - a pattern or cycle of symptoms  - blood tests  - urine tests  - imaging tests  - upper GI endoscopy  - a gastric emptying test\n                \nOften, it is suspected that one of the following is causing their symptoms:\n                \n- gastroparesisa disorder that slows or stops the movement of food from the stomach to the small intestine  - gastroenteritisinflammation of the lining of the stomach, small intestine, and large intestine\n                \nA diagnosis of cyclic vomiting syndrome may be difficult to make until the person sees a health care provider. A health care provider will suspect cyclic vomiting syndrome if the person suffers from repeat episodes of vomiting.\n                \nMedical and Family History\n                \nTaking a medical and family history is one of the first things a health care provider may do to help diagnose cyclic vomiting syndrome. He or she will ask the patient to provide a medical and family history.\n                \nPhysical Exam\n                \nA physical exam may help diagnose other conditions besides cyclic vomiting syndrome. During a physical exam, a health care provider usually\n                \n- examines a patients body  - taps on specific areas of the patients body\n                \nPattern or Cycle of Symptoms in Children3\n                \nA health care provider will often suspect cyclic vomiting syndrome in a child when the child\n                \n- has at least five separate episodes, or at least three separate episodes over 6 months  - has episodes of intense nausea and vomiting lasting 1 hour to 10 days and occurring at least 1 week apart  - has episodes that are similar to previous onesthey tend to start at the same time of day, last the same length of time, and occur with the same symptoms and level of intensity  - vomits during episodes at least four times per hour for at least 1 hour  - vomits and it is not attributed to another disorder  - has absence of nausea and vomiting between episodes\n                \nPattern or Cycle of Symptoms in Adults4,5\n                \nA health care provider will often suspect cyclic vomiting syndrome in adults when the following is present for at least 3 months and the symptoms started more than 6 months ago:\n                \n- Each episode of cyclic vomiting syndrome is usually similar to previous ones, meaning that episodes tend to start at the same time of day and last the same length of timeless than 1 week.  - Three or more separate episodes in the past year.  - Absence of nausea or vomiting between episodes.\n                \nBlood Tests\n                \nA nurse or technician will draw blood samples at a health care providers office or a commercial facility and send the samples to a lab for analysis. The blood test can tell the health care provider if the patient has any signs of dehydration or other problems.\n                \nUrine Tests\n                \nUrinalysis involves testing a urine sample. The patient collects a urine sample in a special container in a health care providers office or a commercial facility. A health care provider tests the sample in the same location or sends the sample to a lab for analysis. A urinalysis can rule out kidney problems or an infection.\n                \nImaging Tests\n                \nThe health care provider decides which test to order based on the symptoms, medical history, and physical exam.\n                \nUpper GI series. A health care provider may order an upper GI series to look at the upper GI tract. A radiologista doctor who specializes in medical imagingperforms this test at a hospital or an outpatient center. This test does not require anesthesia. The patient should not eat or drink for 8 hours before the procedure, if possible. During the procedure, the patient will stand or sit in front of an x-ray machine and drink barium, a chalky liquid. Infants lie on a table and a health care provider gives them barium through a tiny tube placed in the nose that runs into the stomach. Barium coats the GI tract, making signs of obstruction or other problems that can cause vomiting show up more clearly on x rays. A patient may experience bloating and nausea for a short time after the test. The upper GI series can show other problems that may be causing symptoms, such as an ulcer or obstruction.\n                \nAbdominal ultrasound. A health care provider may order an ultrasound to look at the organs in the abdomen. A technician uses a device, called a transducer, that bounces safe, painless sound waves off organs to create an image of their structure. The technician performs the procedure in a health care providers office, an outpatient center, or a hospital. A radiologist interprets the images. A patient does not need anesthesia. The abdominal ultrasound can show other problems that may be causing symptoms, such as gallstones.\n                \nUpper Gastrointestinal Endoscopy\n                \nThis procedure involves using an endoscopea small, flexible tube with a lightto see the inside of the upper digestive system. A health care provider may perform this procedure at a hospital or an outpatient center. The patient should not eat or drink for at least 8 hours before the procedure. The patient will receive a local anesthetic to numb the throat and a sedative to help him or her relax. The health care provider inserts the endoscope through the mouth and guides it through the esophagus and into the stomach and duodenumthe first part of the small intestine. The procedure can take about 30 minutes to 1 hour. The patient may feel some discomfort as the endoscope is inserted, but most people fall asleep during the procedure because of the sedative. After the procedure, the patient may feel some soreness in the throat. The patient should not drive for 24 hours after receiving the sedative and should rest at home for the remainder of the day. The health care provider can use the endoscope to look for signs of inflammation, ulcers, or blockages in the upper GI tract.\n                \nGastric Emptying Study\n                \nA gastric emptying study measures how quickly food moves from the stomach to the small intestine. A health care provider may order this test if he or she suspects gastroparesis, a condition where the muscles in the stomach wall are weakened, leading to slowed or delayed emptying of food from the stomach. In this test, the patient eats a meal that contains a small amount of radioactive material. A special camera takes pictures of the stomach over time, measuring the rate at which the stomach empties. The test takes several hours and is performed at a hospital or an outpatient center. The patient should not eat or drink anything for at least 6 hours before the test. The results of the test can help determine whether gastroparesis is contributing to the patients symptoms.\n                \nOther Conditions That May Cause Similar Symptoms\n                \nSome conditions may have similar symptoms to cyclic vomiting syndrome. These include\n- Migraines  - Gastroparesis  - Irritable bowel syndrome  - Functional dyspepsia  - Inflammatory bowel disease  - Gastroesophageal reflux disease  - Food poisoning  - Viral gastroenteritis  - Appendicitis  - Pancreatitis  - Small bowel bacterial overgrowth  - Intestinal obstruction  - Increased intracranial pressure  - Brain tumors  - Chiari malformation  - Porphyria  - Urea cycle disorders  - Mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy\n                \nIf you suspect that you",

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: What are the treatments for Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome?\n\n    Reference Answer: A health care provider may refer patients to a gastroenterologist for treatment.\n                \nPeople with cyclic vomiting syndrome should get plenty of rest and take medications to prevent a vomiting episode, stop an episode in progress, speed up recovery, or relieve associated symptoms.\n                \nThe health care team tailors treatment to the symptoms experienced during each of the four cyclic vomiting syndrome phases:\n                \n- Prodrome phase treatment. The goal during the prodrome phase is to stop an episode before it progresses. Taking medication early in the phase can help stop an episode from moving to the vomiting phase or becoming severe; however, people do not always realize an episode is coming. For example, a person may wake up in the morning and begin vomiting. A health care provider may recommend the following medications for both children and adults:      - ondansetron (Zofran) or lorazepam (Ativan) for nausea    - ibuprofen for abdominal pain    - ranitidine (Zantac), lansoprazole (Prevacid), or omeprazole (Prilosec, Zegerid) to control stomach acid production    - sumatriptan (Imitrex)prescribed as a nasal spray, an injection, or a pill that dissolves under the tonguefor migraines    - Vomiting phase treatment. Once vomiting begins, people should call or see a health care provider as soon as possible. Treatment usually requires the person to stay in bed and sleep in a dark, quiet room. A health care provider may recommend the following for both children and adults:      - medication for pain, nausea, and reducing stomach acid and anxiety    - anti-migraine medications such as sumatriptan to stop symptoms of a migraine or possibly stop an episode in progress    - hospitalization for severe nausea and vomiting    - IV fluids and medications to prevent dehydration and treat symptoms    - IV nutrition if an episode continues for several days    - Recovery phase treatment. During the recovery phase, drinking and eating will replace lost electrolytes. A person may need IV fluids for a period of time. Some people find their appetite returns to normal right away, while others start by drinking clear liquids and then moving slowly to other liquids and solid food. A health care provider may prescribe medications during the recovery phase and well phase to prevent future episodes.  - Well phase treatment. During the well phase, a health care provider may use medications to treat people whose episodes...\n\n    Generated Answer: Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome (CVS) is a rare disorder that can be challenging to treat. Treatment typically focuses on managing symptoms and preventing future episodes. Here are some common treatment approaches:\n\n1. **Rest and Hydration:** During an episode, it's essential to rest and stay hydrated. This can help the body recover from the episode more quickly.\n\n2. **Medications:** Several types of medications can be used to treat CVS. These include anti-nausea drugs, migraine medications, and acid-blocking drugs. In some cases, drugs used to treat seizures or depression may also be used.\n\n3. **Dietary Changes:** Some people find that certain foods trigger CVS episodes. Identifying and avoiding these triggers can help reduce the frequency and severity of episodes.\n\n4. **Stress Management:** Stress can trigger CVS episodes in some people....\n\n    Scoring guide:\n    1.

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: How to diagnose Ulcerative Colitis?\n\n    Reference Answer: A health care provider diagnoses ulcerative colitis with the following:\n                \n- medical and family history  - physical exam  - lab tests  - endoscopies of the large intestine\n                \nThe health care provider may perform a series of medical tests to rule out other bowel disorders, such as irritable bowel syndrome, Crohn's disease, or celiac disease, that may cause symptoms similar to those of ulcerative colitis. Read more about these conditions on the Digestive Disease A-Z list.\n                \nMedical and Family History\n                \nTaking a medical and family history can help the health care provider diagnose ulcerative colitis and understand a patient's symptoms. The health care provider will also ask the patient about current and past medical conditions and medications.\n                \nPhysical Exam\n                \nA physical exam may help diagnose ulcerative colitis. During a physical exam, the health care provider most often\n                \n- checks for abdominal distension, or swelling  - listens to sounds within the abdomen using a stethoscope  - taps on the abdomen to check for tenderness and pain\n                \nLab Tests\n                \nA health care provider may order lab tests to help diagnose ulcerative colitis, including blood and stool tests.\n                \nBlood tests. A blood test involves drawing blood at a health care provider's office or a lab. A lab technologist will analyze the blood sample. A health care provider may use blood tests to look for\n                \n- anemia  - inflammation or infection somewhere in the body  - markers that show ongoing inflammation  - low albumin, or proteincommon in patients with severe ulcerative colitis\n                \nStool tests. A stool test is the analysis of a sample of stool. A health care provider will give the patient a container for catching and storing the stool at home. The patient returns the sample to the health care provider or to a lab. A lab technologist will analyze the stool sample. Health care providers commonly order stool tests to rule out other causes of GI diseases, such as infection.\n                \nEndoscopies of the Large Intestine\n                \nEndoscopies of the large intestine are the most accurate methods for diagnosing ulcerative colitis and ruling out other possible conditions, such as Crohn's disease, diverticular disease, or cancer. Endoscopies of the large intestine include\n                \n- colonoscopy  - flexible sigmoidoscopy\n                \nColonoscopy. Colonoscopy is a test that uses a long, flexible, narrow tube with a light and tiny camera on one end, called a colonoscope or scope, to look inside the rectum and entire colon. In most cases, light anesthesia and pain medication help patients relax for the test. The medical staff will monitor a patient's vital signs and try to make him or her as comfortable as possible. A nurse or technician places an intravenous (IV) needle in a vein in the patient's arm or hand to give anesthesia.\n                \nFor the test, the patient will lie on a table or stretcher while the gastroenterologist inserts a colonoscope into the patient's anus and slowly guides it through the rectum and into the colon. The scope inflates the large intestine with air to give the gastroenterologist a better view. The camera sends a video image of the intestinal lining to a monitor, allowing the gastroenterologist to carefully examine the tissues lining the colon and rectum. The gastroenterologist may move the patient several times and adjust the scope for better viewing. Once the scope has reached the opening to the small intestine, the gastroenterologist slowly withdraws it and examines the lining of the colon and rectum again.\n                \nA colonoscopy can show irritated and swollen tissue, ulcers, and abnormal growths such as polypsextra pieces of tissue that grow on the inner lining of the intestine. If the gastroenterologist suspects ulcerative colitis, he or she will biopsy the patient's colon and rectum. A biopsy is a procedure that involves taking small pieces of tissue for examination with a microscope.\n                \nA health care provider will give patients written bowel prep instructions to follow at home before the test. The health care provider will also give patients information about how to care for themselves following the procedure.\n                \nFlexible sigmoidoscopy. Flexible sigmoidoscopy is a test that uses a flexible, narrow tube with a light and tiny camera on one end, called a sigmoidoscope or scope, to look inside the rectum, the sigmoid colon, and sometimes the descending colon. In most cases, a patient does not need anesthesia.\n                \nFor the test, the patient will lie on a table or stretcher while the health care provider inserts the sigmoidoscope into the patient's anus and slowly guides it through the rectum, the sigmoid colon, and sometimes the descending colon. The scope inflates the large intestine with air to give the health care provider a better view. The camera sends a video image of the intestinal lining to a monitor, allowing the health care provider to examine the tissues lining the rectum, sigmoid colon, and sometimes the descending colon. The health care provider may move the patient several times and adjust the scope for better viewing. Once the scope has reached as far as it can go, the health care provider slowly withdraws it and examines the lining of the rectum, sigmoid colon, and sometimes the descending colon again.\n                \nA flexible sigmoidoscopy can show irritated and swollen tissue, ulcers, and abnormal growths such as polyps. However, the test cannot reach the upper part of the colon, so the gastroenterologist may still need to perform a colonoscopy if he or she suspects ulcerative colitis.\n                \nA health care provider will give patients written bowel prep instructions to follow at home before the test. The health care provider will also give patients information about how to care for themselves following the procedure.\n\n    Model Answer: To diagnose Ulcerative Colitis, a healthcare provider would typically conduct a combination of the following:\n\n1. Medical and Family History: Taking a thorough medical and family history to understand the patient's symptoms and potential genetic predispositions.\n\n2. Physical Exam: Performing a physical exam to check for abdominal distension, listen to sounds within the abdomen, and tap on the abdomen to check for tenderness and pain.\n\n3. Lab Tests: Ordering blood and stool tests to look for signs of anemia, inflammation, infection, and low albumin levels.\n\n4. Endoscopies of the Large Intestine: Conducting endoscopic procedures such as colonoscopy or flexible sigmoidoscopy to visually examine the interior of the large intestine for signs of irritation, ulcers, and abnormal growths.\n\nThese diagnostic steps help rule out other bowel disorders and confirm the presence of Ulcerative Colitis.",

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: What are the treatments for Ulcerative Colitis?\n\n    Reference Answer: A health care provider treats ulcerative colitis with\n                \n- medications  - surgery\n                \nWhich treatment a person needs depends on the severity of the disease and the symptoms. Each person experiences ulcerative colitis differently, so health care providers adjust treatments to improve the person's symptoms and induce, or bring about, remission.\n                \nMedications\n                \nWhile no medication cures ulcerative colitis, many can reduce symptoms. The goals of medication therapy are\n                \n- inducing and maintaining remission  - improving the person's quality of life\n                \nMany people with ulcerative colitis require medication therapy indefinitely, unless they have their colon and rectum surgically removed.\n                \nHealth care providers will prescribe the medications that best treat a person's symptoms:\n                \n- aminosalicylates  - corticosteroids  - immunomodulators  - biologics, also called anti-TNF therapies  - other medications\n                \nDepending on the location of the symptoms in the colon, health care providers may recommend a person take medications by\n                \n- enema, which involves flushing liquid medication into the rectum using a special wash bottle. The medication directly treats inflammation of the large intestine.  - rectal foama foamy substance the person puts into the rectum like an enema. The medication directly treats inflammation of the large intestine.  - suppositorya solid medication the person inserts into the rectum to dissolve. The intestinal lining absorbs the medication.  - mouth.  - IV.\n                \nAminosalicylates are medications that contain 5-aminosalicyclic acid (5-ASA), which helps control inflammation. Health care providers typically use aminosalicylates to treat people with mild or moderate symptoms or help people stay in remission. Aminosalicylates can be prescribed as an oral medication or a topical medicationby enema or suppository. Combination therapyoral and rectalis most effective, even in people with extensive ulcerative colitis.5 Aminosalicylates are generally well tolerated.\n                \nAminosalicylates include\n                \n- balsalazide  - mesalamine  - olsalazine  - sulfasalazinea combination of sulfapyridine and 5-ASA\n                \nSome of the common side effects of aminosalicylates include\n                \n- abdominal pain  - diarrhea  - headaches  - nausea\n                \nHealth care providers may order routine blood tests for kidney function, as aminosalicylates can cause a rare allergic reaction in the kidneys.\n                \nCorticosteroids, also known as steroids, help reduce the activity of the immune system and decrease inflammation. Health care providers prescribe corticosteroids for people with more severe symptoms and people who do not respond to aminosalicylates. Health care providers do not typically prescribe corticosteroids for long-term use.\n                \nCorticosteroids are effective in bringing on remission; however, studies have not shown that the medications help maintain long-term remission. Corticosteroids include\n                \n- budesonide  - hydrocortisone  - methylprednisone  - prednisone\n                \nSide effects of corticosteroids include\n                \n- acne  - a higher chance of developing infections  - bone mass loss  - death of bone tissue  - high blood glucose  - high blood pressure  - mood swings  - weight gain\n                \nPeople who take budesonide may have fewer side effects than with other steroids.\n                \nImmunomodulators reduce immune system activity, resulting in less inflammation in the colon. These medications can take several weeks to 3 months to start working. Immunomodulators include\n                \n- azathioprine  - 6-mercaptopurine, or 6-MP\n                \nHealth care providers prescribe these medications for people who do not respond to 5-ASAs. People taking these medications may have the following side effects:\n                \n- abnormal liver tests  - feeling tired  - infection  - low white blood cell count, which can lead to a higher chance of infection  - nausea and vomiting  - pancreatitis  - slightly increased chance of lymphoma  - slightly increased chance of nonmelanoma skin cancers\n                \nHealth care providers routinely test blood counts and liver function of people taking immunomodulators. People taking these medications should also have yearly skin cancer exams.\n                \nPeople should talk with their health care provider about the risks and benefits of immunomodulators.\n                \nBiologicsincluding adalimumab, golimumab, infliximab, and vedolizumabare medications that target a protein made by the immune system called tumor necrosis factor (TNF). These medications decrease inflammation in the large intestine by neutralizing TNF. Anti-TNF therapies work quickly to bring on remission, especially in people who do not respond to other medications. Infliximab and vedolizumab are given through an IV infusion every few weeks. Adalimumab and golimumab are injected under the skin at home. Biologics can increase the risk of certain complications, including\n                \n- activation of latent tuberculosis  - hepatitis B reactivation  - increased risk of certain cancers  - increased risk of serious infections  - lupus-like syndrome  - multiple sclerosis  - optic neuritis  - seizures  - worsening heart failure\n                \nOther medications\n                \nJAK inhibitors, such as tofacitinib, block enzymes involved in producing substances that promote inflammation. JAK inhibitors are taken orally once or twice daily. Side effects include\n                \n- anemia  - changes in cholesterol levels  - headache  - increased creatinine levels  - increased liver enzyme levels  - increased risk of shingles  - thrombocytopenia  - upper respiratory tract infections\n                \nSurgery\n                \nSometimes, health care providers recommend surgery to remove the colon and rectum, a procedure called proctocolectomy, when a person has\n                \n- bleeding that won't stop  - precancerous cells, such as dysplasia  - severe side effects from medications  - very bad narrowing of the bowel\n                \nAfter removing the colon and rectum, surgeons perform one of two types of operations:\n                \n- ileostomy, where the surgeon creates an opening in the abdomen called a stoma through which stool passes out of the body into a pouch attached to the skin.  - ileal pouch-anal anastomosis, where the surgeon removes the diseased portion of the large intestine and rectum and uses the end of the small intestine to create an internal pouch to hold stool before it passes through the anus.\n                \nThe goal of either surgery is to improve the person's quality of life by eliminating chronic diarrhea and abdominal pain. However, both surgeries carry risks, such as\n                \n- bowel obstruction  - infection  - narrowing of the anal opening  - pouchitisinflammation of the internal pouch  - poor absorption of nutrients\n                \nResearchers are exploring new treatments for ulcerative colitis, including\n                \n- fecal microbiota transplantation  - gene therapy  - stem cell therapy\n\n    Model Answer: Medications and surgery are used to treat ulcerative colitis. Medications aim to induce and maintain remission, improve quality of life, and reduce symptoms. Types of medications include aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, immunomodulators, biologics, and JAK inhibitors. Surgery, specifically proctocolectomy, may be recommended in severe cases, such as",

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: How to diagnose Amyloidosis and Kidney Disease?\n\n    Reference Answer: A health care provider diagnoses primary amyloidosis of the kidneys with\n                \n- a medical and family history  - a physical exam  - urinalysis  - blood tests  - a kidney biopsy\n                \nMedical and Family History\n                \nTaking a medical and family history may help a health care provider diagnose amyloidosis of the kidneys. He or she will ask the patient to provide a medical and family history.\n                \nPhysical Exam\n                \nA physical exam may help diagnose primary amyloidosis of the kidneys. During a physical exam, a health care provider usually\n                \n- examines a patients body to check for swelling  - uses a stethoscope to listen to the lungs  - taps on specific areas of the patients body\n                \nUrinalysis\n                \nA health care provider may use urinalysisthe testing of a urine sampleto check for albumin and amyloid proteins in urine. The patient provides a urine sample in a special container at a health care providers office or a commercial facility. A nurse or technician can test the sample in the same location or send it to a lab for analysis. More-than-normal amounts of albumin in urine may indicate kidney damage due to primary amyloidosis. Amyloid proteins in urine may indicate amyloidosis.\n                \nBlood Tests\n                \nThe health care provider may use blood tests to see how well the kidneys are working and to check for amyloid proteins and hyperlipidemia. A blood test involves drawing a patients blood at a health care providers office or a commercial facility and sending the sample to a lab for analysis. Blood tests for kidney function measure the waste products in the blood that healthy kidneys normally filter out. Hyperlipidemia may indicate nephrotic syndrome. Amyloid proteins in blood may indicate amyloidosis.\n                \nKidney Biopsy\n                \nOnly a biopsy can show the amyloid protein deposits in the kidneys. A health care provider may recommend a kidney biopsy if other tests show kidney damage. A kidney biopsy is a procedure that involves taking a piece of kidney tissue for examination with a microscope. A health care provider performs a kidney biopsy in a hospital with light sedation and local...\n\n    Generated Answer: Amyloidosis and kidney disease are diagnosed through a combination of tests and procedures. Here are the general steps:\n\n1. Medical history and physical exam: The doctor will ask about your symptoms, medical history, and family history of any chronic illnesses. They will also perform a physical exam to check for any abnormalities.\n2. Blood and urine tests: These tests can detect abnormal levels of protein, creatinine, and other substances that may indicate kidney damage or dysfunction.\n3. Imaging tests: Ultrasound, CT scan, or MRI may be used to visualize the kidneys and check for any abnormalities such as tumors, cysts, or scarring.\n4. Kidney biopsy: This is the most definitive way to diagnose amyloidosis and kidney disease. A small sample of kidney tissue is removed and examined under a microscope for the presence of amyloid...\n\n    Scoring guide:\n    1.

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: How to prevent Hypoglycemia?\n\n    Reference Answer: Diabetes treatment plans are designed to match the dose and timing of medication to a person's usual schedule of meals and activities. Mismatches could result in hypoglycemia. For example, taking a dose of insulinor other medication that increases insulin levelsbut then skipping a meal could result in hypoglycemia.\n                \nTo help prevent hypoglycemia, people with diabetes should always consider the following:\n                \n- Their diabetes medications. A health care provider can explain which diabetes medications can cause hypoglycemia and explain how and when to take medications. For good diabetes management, people with diabetes should take diabetes medications in the recommended doses at the recommended times. In some cases, health care providers may suggest that patients learn how to adjust medications to match changes in their schedule or routine.  - Their meal plan. A registered dietitian can help design a meal plan that fits one's personal preferences and lifestyle. Following one's meal plan is important for managing diabetes. People with diabetes should eat regular meals, have enough food at each meal, and try not to skip meals or snacks. Snacks are particularly important for some people before going to sleep or exercising. Some snacks may be more effective than others in preventing hypoglycemia overnight. The dietitian can make recommendations for snacks.  - Their daily activity. To help prevent hypoglycemia caused by physical activity, health care providers may advise      - checking blood glucose before sports, exercise, or other physical activity and having a snack if the level is below 100 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL)    - adjusting medication before physical activity    - checking blood glucose at regular intervals during extended periods of physical activity and having snacks as needed    - checking blood glucose periodically after physical activity    - Their use of alcoholic beverages. Drinking alcoholic beverages, especially on an empty stomach, can cause hypoglycemia, even a day or two later. Heavy drinking can be particularly dangerous for people taking insulin or medications that increase insulin production. Alcoholic beverages should always be consumed with a snack or meal at the same time. A health care provider can suggest how to safely include alcohol in a meal plan.  - Their diabetes management plan. Intensive diabetes managementkeeping blood glucose as close to the normal range as possible to prevent long-term complicationscan increase the risk of hypoglycemia. Those whose goal is tight control should talk with a health care provider about ways to prevent hypoglycemia and how best to treat it if it occurs.\n                \nWhat to Ask the Doctor about Diabetes Medications\n              ...\n\n    Generated Answer: Here are some tips to help prevent hypoglycemia:\n\n1. Eat regular meals and snacks: Eating at regular intervals can help maintain your blood sugar levels.\n2. Monitor your blood sugar levels: Check your blood sugar levels regularly, especially before meals, before bedtime, and after intense physical activity.\n3. Adjust your medication: If you are taking medication for diabetes, work with your healthcare provider to adjust the dosage as needed.\n4. Be mindful of carbohydrate intake: Carbohydrates are the nutrients that affect your blood sugar levels the most. Be mindful of your...\n\n    Scoring guide:\n    1.

They may need a change in their treatment plan: less medication or a different medication, a new schedule for insulin or medication, a different meal plan, or a new physical activity plan.\n                \nPrompt Treatment for Hypoglycemia\n                \nWhen people think their blood glucose is too low, they should check the blood glucose level of a blood sample using a meter. If the level is below 70 mg/dL, one of these quick-fix foods should be consumed right away to raise blood glucose:\n                \n- 3 or 4 glucose tablets  - 1 serving of glucose gelthe amount equal to 15 grams of carbohydrate  - 1/2 cup, or 4 ounces, of any fruit juice  - 1/2 cup, or 4 ounces, of a regularnot dietsoft drink  - 1 cup, or 8 ounces, of milk  - 5 or 6 pieces of hard candy  - 1 tablespoon of sugar or honey\n                \nRecommended amounts may be less for small children. The child's doctor can advise about the right amount to give a child.\n                \nThe next step is to recheck blood glucose in 15 minutes to make sure it is 70 mg/dL or above. If it's still too low, another serving of a quick-fix food should be eaten. These steps should be repeated until the blood glucose level is 70 mg/dL or above. If the next meal is an hour or more away, a snack should be eaten once the quick-fix foods have raised the blood glucose level to 70 mg/dL or above.\n                \nFor People Who Take Acarbose (Precose) or Miglitol (Glyset)\n                \nPeople who take either of these diabetes medications should know that only pure glucose, also called dextroseavailable in tablet or gel formwill raise their blood glucose level during a low blood glucose episode. Other quick-fix foods and drinks won't raise the level quickly enough because acarbose and miglitol slow the digestion of other forms of carbohydrate.\n                \nHelp from Others for Severe Hypoglycemia\n                \nSevere hypoglycemiavery low blood glucosecan cause a person to pass out and can even be life threatening. Severe hypoglycemia is more likely to occur in people with type 1 diabetes. People should ask a health care provider what to do about severe hypoglycemia. Another person can help someone who has passed out by giving an injection of glucagon. Glucagon will rapidly bring the blood glucose level back to normal and help the person regain consciousness. A health care provider can prescribe a glucagon emergency kit. Family, friends, or coworkersthe people who will be around the person at risk of hypoglycemiacan learn how to give a glucagon injection and when to call 911 or get medical help.\n                \nPhysical Activity and Blood Glucose Levels\n                \nPhysical activity has many benefits for people with diabetes, including lowering blood glucose levels. However, physical activity can make levels too low and can cause hypoglycemia up to 24 hours afterward. A health care provider can advise about checking the blood glucose level before exercise. For those who take insulin or one of the oral medications that increase insulin production, the health care provider may suggest having a snack if the glucose level is below 100 mg/dL or adjusting medication doses before physical activity to help avoid hypoglycemia. A snack can prevent hypoglycemia. The health care provider may suggest extra blood glucose checks, especially after strenuous exercise.\n                \nHypoglycemia When Driving\n                \nHypoglycemia is particularly dangerous if it happens to someone who is driving. People with hypoglycemia may have trouble concentrating or seeing clearly behind the wheel and may not be able to react quickly to road hazards or to the actions of other drivers. To prevent problems, people at risk for hypoglycemia should check their blood glucose level before driving. During longer trips, they should check their blood glucose level frequently and eat snacks as needed to keep the level at 70 mg/dL or above. If necessary, they should stop for treatment and then make sure their blood glucose level is 70 mg/dL or above before starting to drive again.\n                \nHypoglycemia Unawareness\n                \nSome people with diabetes do not have early warning signs of low blood glucose, a condition called hypoglycemia unawareness. This lack of awareness means they don't feel the usual symptoms of hypoglycemia, such as shakiness or confusion, until the blood glucose level drops very low. People with hypoglycemia unawareness need to test their blood glucose frequently, especially before eating and physical activity, and whenever they suspect that their level might be dropping. They may want to consider wearing a continuous glucose monitor CGM, which measures glucose levels throughout the day and can alert users to high or low levels. People with hypoglycemia unawareness should talk with their health care provider about how to prevent and treat episodes of low blood glucose.\n                \nNighttime Low Blood Glucose\n                \nLow blood glucose can happen at night, too. Nocturnal hypoglycemia can occur in people who take insulin or certain oral medications for diabetes. People who notice that their blood glucose levels are consistently low at night may want to consult with their health care provider about possible changes in their treatment plan. Some ways to manage nighttime lows include setting an alarm to test blood glucose levels during the night; asking a partner or family member to check on them periodically during the night; using a continuous glucose monitor CGM; or adjusting the dose or timing of their medication or insulin regimen.\n                \nPreventing Hypoglycemia\n                \nTo prevent hypoglycemia, people with diabetes should work with their health care provider to adjust their treatment plan as needed. Here are some tips to help prevent hypoglycemia:\n                \n- Eat all your meals and don't skip snacks.\n- Don't take too much medication.\n- Have a carbohydrate snack before exercising.\n- Monitor your blood glucose regularly.\n- Adjust your medication or insulin doses as directed by your healthcare provider.\n- Tell your family, friends, and coworkers about your diabetes and teach them how to recognize hypoglycemic episodes and how to administer glucagon.\n                \nIf you're taking insulin or diabetes pills, you're at higher risk for hypoglycemia. You should always carry a source of fast-acting carbohydrates with you, like glucose tablets or gels, hard candies, or raisins. In case of severe hypoglycemia, always carry a glucagon kit with you and make sure someone close to you knows how to use it.\n\n    Model Answer: Treatments for hypoglycemia include consuming quick-fix foods such as glucose tablets, glucose gel, fruit juice, soft drinks, milk, hard candy, or sugar/honey to raise blood glucose",

            "raw_response": "Evaluate this medical answer based on the criteria below. Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: What to do for Hypoglycemia?\n\n    Reference Answer: Two types of hypoglycemia can occur in people who do not have diabetes:\n                \n- Reactive hypoglycemia, also called postprandial hypoglycemia, occurs within 4 hours after meals.  - Fasting hypoglycemia, also called postabsorptive hypoglycemia, is often related to an underlying disease.\n                \nSymptoms of both reactive and fasting hypoglycemia are similar to diabetes-related hypoglycemia. Symptoms may include hunger, sweating, shakiness, dizziness, light-headedness, sleepiness, confusion, difficulty speaking, anxiety, and weakness.\n                \nTo find the cause of a patient's hypoglycemia, the doctor will use laboratory tests to measure blood glucose, insulin, and other chemicals that play a part in the body's use of energy.\n                \nReactive Hypoglycemia\n                \nDiagnosis\n                \nTo diagnose reactive hypoglycemia, the doctor may\n                \n- ask about signs and symptoms  - test blood glucose while the patient is having symptoms by taking a blood sample from the arm and sending it to a laboratory for analysis*  - check to see whether the symptoms ease after the patient's blood glucose returns to 70 mg/dL or above after eating or drinking\n                \nA blood glucose level below 70 mg/dL at the time of symptoms and relief after eating will confirm the diagnosis. The oral glucose tolerance test is no longer used to diagnose reactive hypoglycemia because experts now know the test can actually trigger hypoglycemic symptoms.\n                \nCauses and Treatment\n                \nThe causes of most cases of reactive hypoglycemia are still open to debate. Some researchers suggest that certain people may be more sensitive to the body's normal release of the hormone epinephrine, which causes many of the symptoms of hypoglycemia. Others believe deficiencies in glucagon secretion might lead to reactive hypoglycemia.\n                \nA few causes of reactive hypoglycemia are certain, but they are uncommon. Gastricor stomachsurgery can cause reactive hypoglycemia because of the rapid passage of food into the small intestine. Rare enzyme deficiencies diagnosed early in life, such as hereditary fructose intolerance, also may cause reactive hypoglycemia.\n                \nTo relieve reactive hypoglycemia, some health professionals recommend\n                \n- eating small meals and snacks about every 3 hours  - being physically active  - eating a variety of foods, including meat, poultry, fish, or nonmeat sources of protein; starchy foods such as whole-grain bread, rice, and potatoes; fruits; vegetables; and dairy products  - eating foods high in fiber  - avoiding or limiting foods high in sugar, especially on an empty stomach\n                \nThe doctor can refer patients to a registered dietitian for personalized meal planning advice. Although some health professionals recommend a diet high in protein and low in carbohydrates, studies have not proven the effectiveness of this kind of diet to treat reactive hypoglycemia.\n                \nFasting Hypoglycemia\n                \nDiagnosis\n                \nFasting hypoglycemia is diagnosed from a blood sample that shows a blood glucose level below 50 mg/dL after an overnight fast, between meals, or after physical activity.\n                \nCauses and Treatment\n                \nCauses of fasting hypoglycemia include certain medications, alcoholic beverages, critical illnesses, hormonal deficiencies, some kinds of tumors, and certain conditions occurring in infancy and childhood.\n                \nMedications. Medications, including some used to treat diabetes, are the most common cause of hypoglycemia. Other medications that can cause hypoglycemia include\n                \n- salicylates, including aspirin, when taken in large doses  - sulfa medications, which are used to treat bacterial infections  - pentamidine, which treats a serious kind of pneumonia  - quinine, which is used to treat malaria\n                \nIf using any of these medications causes a person's blood glucose level to fall, the doctor may advise stopping the medication or changing the dose.\n                \nAlcoholic beverages. Drinking alcoholic beverages, especially binge drinking, can cause hypoglycemia. The body's breakdown of alcohol interferes with the liver's efforts to raise blood glucose. Hypoglycemia caused by excessive drinking can be serious and even fatal.\n                \nCritical illnesses. Some illnesses that affect the liver, heart, or kidneys can cause hypoglycemia. Sepsis, which is an overwhelming infection, and starvation are other causes of hypoglycemia. In these cases, treating the illness or other underlying cause will correct the hypoglycemia.\n                \nHormonal deficiencies. Hormonal deficiencies may cause hypoglycemia in very young children, but rarely in adults. Shortages of cortisol, growth hormone, glucagon, or epinephrine can contribute to hypoglycemia.\n                \nTumors. Certain rare tumors, including those that produce excess amounts of insulin, can cause hypoglycemia. These tumors are usually found in the pancreas, but may also appear in the abdomen, chest, neck, or pelvis.\n                \nInfancy and childhood. Children typically outgrow the causes of fasting hypoglycemia. However, some infants are born with metabolic disorders or genetic syndromes that can cause hypoglycemia. Examples include\n                \n- glycogen storage diseases  - hereditary fructose intolerance  - phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase deficiency  - fatty acid oxidation defects\n                \nIn some cases, eating frequent, balanced meals can help alleviate the symptoms of fasting hypoglycemia. In other cases, treatment involves addressing the underlying cause.\n                \nPrevention\n                \nPeople can prevent hypoglycemia by\n                \n- eating regular meals  - choosing complex carbohydrates, such as whole grains, fruits, and vegetables  - avoiding skipping meals  - limiting intake of simple sugars, caffeine, and alcohol\n                \nIn addition, people should avoid fasting or severe calorie restriction without consulting their doctor first. People with a history of hypoglycemia should talk with their doctor or a registered dietitian about the best ways to prevent future episodes.\n\n    Model Answer: To manage hypoglycemia, eat small meals and snacks every 3 hours, be physically active, and consume a variety of foods including protein, starchy foods, fruits, vegetables, and dairy products. Avoid or limit sugary foods, especially on an empty stomach. A registered dietitian can provide personalized meal planning advice. Additionally, preventing hypoglycemia can be achieved by eating regular meals, choosing complex carbohydrates, avoiding skipping meals, and limiting intake of simple sugars, caffeine, and alcohol.",

The most common tests used to diagnose diabetes are:\n\n1. Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG) Test: This measures your blood sugar after not eating for at least eight hours. A fasting blood sugar level less than 100 mg/dL is normal. A fasting blood sugar level from 100 to 125 mg/dL is considered prediabetes. If it's 126 mg/dL or higher on two separate tests, you have diabetes.\n2. Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT): For this test, you fast overnight, and the fasting blood sugar level is measured. Then you drink a sugary liquid, and blood sugar levels are tested periodically for the next two hours. A blood sugar level less than 140 mg/dL is normal. A reading of more than 200 mg/dL after two hours indicates diabetes. A reading between 140 and 199 mg/dL indicates prediabetes.\n3.

A rectal exam is performed in the health care providers office; anesthesia is not needed. To perform the exam, the health care provider asks the person to bend over a table or lie on one side while holding the knees close to the chest. The health care provider slides a gloved, lubricated finger into the rectum. The exam is used to check for pain, bleeding, or a blockage in the intestine.\n                \nThe health care provider may schedule one or more of the following tests:\n                \n- Blood test. A blood test involves drawing a persons blood at a health care providers office, a commercial facility, or a hospital and sending the sample to a lab for analysis. The blood test can show the presence of inflammation or anemiaa condition in which red blood cells are fewer or smaller than normal, which prevents the bodys cells from getting enough oxygen.  - Computerized tomography (CT) scan. A CT scan of the colon is the most common test used to diagnose diverticular disease. CT scans use a combination of x rays and computer technology to create three-dimensional (3D) images. For a CT scan, the person may be given a solution to drink and an injection of a special dye, called contrast medium. CT scans require the person to lie on a table that slides into a tunnel-shaped device where the x rays are taken. The procedure is performed in an outpatient center or a hospital by an x-ray technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologista doctor who specializes in medical imaging. Anesthesia is not needed. CT scans can detect diverticulosis and confirm the diagnosis of diverticulitis.  - Lower gastrointestinal (GI) series. A lower GI series is an x-ray exam that is used to look at the large intestine. The test is performed at a hospital or an outpatient center by an x-ray technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologist. Anesthesia is not needed. The health care provider may provide written bowel prep instructions to follow at home before the test. The person may be asked to follow a clear liquid diet for 1 to 3 days before the procedure. A laxative or enema may be used before the test. A laxative is medication that loosens stool and increases bowel movements. An enema involves flushing water or laxative into the rectum using a special squirt bottle. These medications cause diarrhea, so the person should stay close to a bathroom during the bowel prep.   - For the test, the person will lie on a table while the radiologist inserts a flexible tube into the persons anus. The colon is filled with barium, making signs of diverticular disease show up more clearly on x rays.  - For several days, traces of barium in the large intestine can cause stools to be white or light colored. Enemas and repeated bowel movements may cause anal soreness. A health care provider will provide specific instructions about eating and drinking after the test.  - Colonoscopy. The test is performed at a hospital or an outpatient center by a gastroenterologist. Before the test, the persons health care provider will provide written bowel prep instructions to follow at home. The person may need to follow a clear liquid diet for 1 to 3 days before the test. The person may also need to take laxatives and enemas the evening before the test.  - In most cases, light anesthesia, and possibly pain medication, helps people relax for the test. The person will lie on a table while the gastroenterologist inserts a flexible tube into the anus.

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: What are the treatments for Diverticular Disease?\n\n    Reference Answer: A health care provider may treat the symptoms of diverticulosis with a high-fiber diet or fiber supplements, medications, and possibly probiotics. Treatment for diverticular disease varies, depending on whether a person has diverticulitis or diverticular bleeding.\n                \nDiverticulosis\n                \nHigh-fiber diet. Studies have shown that a high-fiber diet can help prevent diverticular disease in people who already have diverticulosis.2 A health care provider may recommend a slow increase in dietary fiber to minimize gas and abdominal discomfort. For more information about fiber-rich foods, see Eating, Diet, and Nutrition.\n                \nFiber supplements. A health care provider may recommend taking a fiber product such as methylcellulose (Citrucel) or psyllium (Metamucil) one to three times a day. These products are available as powders, pills, or wafers and provide 0.5 to 3.5 grams of fiber per dose. Fiber products should be taken with at least 8 ounces of water.\n                \nMedications. A number of studies suggest the medication mesalazine (Asacol), given either continuously or in cycles, may be effective at reducing abdominal pain and GI symptoms of diverticulosis. Research has also shown that combining mesalazine with the antibiotic rifaximin (Xifaxan) can be significantly more effective than using rifaximin alone to improve a persons symptoms and maintain periods of remission, which means being free of symptoms.4\n                \nProbiotics. Although more research is needed, probiotics may help treat the symptoms of diverticulosis, prevent the onset of diverticulitis, and reduce the chance of recurrent symptoms. Probiotics are live bacteria, like those normally found in the GI tract. Probiotics can be found in dietary supplementsin capsules, tablets, and powdersand in some foods, such as yogurt.\n                \nTo help ensure coordinated and safe care, people should discuss their use of complementary and alternative medical practices, including their use of dietary supplements and probiotics, with their health care provider. Read more at www.nccam.nih.gov/health/probiotics.\n                \nTips for talking with health care providers are available at www.nccam.nih.gov/timetotalk.\n                \nDiverticular Bleeding\n                \nDiverticular bleeding is rare. Bleeding can be severe; however, it may stop by itself and not require treatment. A person who has bleeding from the rectumeven a small amountshould see a health care provider right away.\n                \nTo treat the bleeding, a colonoscopy may be performed to identify the location of and stop the bleeding. A CT scan or angiogram also may be used to identify the site of the bleeding. A traditional angiogram is a special kind of x ray in which a thin, flexible tube called a catheter is threaded through a large artery, often from the groin, to the area of bleeding. Contrast medium is injected through the catheter so the artery shows up more clearly on the x ray. The procedure is performed in a hospital or an outpatient center by an x-ray technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologist. Anesthesia is not needed, though a sedative may be given to lessen anxiety during the procedure.\n                \nIf the bleeding does not stop, abdominal surgery with a colon resection may be necessary. In a colon resection, the surgeon removes the affected part of the colon and joins the remaining ends of the colon together; general anesthesia is used. A blood transfusion may be needed if the person has lost a significant amount of blood.\n                \nDiverticulitis\n                \nDiverticulitis with mild symptoms and no complications usually requires a person to rest, take oral antibiotics, and be on a liquid diet for a period of time. If symptoms ease after a few days, the health care provider will recommend gradually adding solid foods back into the diet.\n                \nSevere...\n\n    Generated Answer: Diverticular disease can be treated with a combination of dietary changes, medication, and, in some cases, surgery.\n\n1. Diet: A high-fiber diet can help prevent diverticular disease and alleviate its symptoms. This includes foods like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes.\n\n2.

While many people with diverticula do not have symptoms, some may experience abdominal pain, bloating, constipation, or diarrhea.\n\nHere are some general recommendations for managing diverticular disease:\n\n1. Eat a high-fiber diet: A diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes can help prevent the formation of new diverticula and reduce symptoms.\n2.

He or she will ask the patient about symptoms and may request a history of past operations.\n                \nPhysical Exam\n                \nA physical exam may help diagnose short bowel syndrome. During a physical exam, a health care provider usually\n                \n- examines a patient's body, looking for muscle wasting or weight loss and signs of vitamin and mineral deficiencies  - uses a stethoscope to listen to sounds in the abdomen  - taps on specific areas of the patient's body\n                \nBlood Tests\n                \nA blood test involves drawing a patient's blood at a health care provider's office or a commercial facility and sending the sample to a lab for analysis. Blood tests can show mineral and vitamin levels and measure complete blood count.\n                \nFecal Fat Tests\n                \nA fecal fat test measures the body's ability to break down and absorb fat. For this test, a patient provides a stool sample at a health care provider's office. The patient may also use a take-home test kit. The patient collects stool in plastic wrap that he or she lays over the toilet seat and places a sample into a container. A patient can also use a special tissue provided by the health care provider's office to collect the sample and place the tissue into the container. For children wearing diapers, the parent or caretaker can line the diaper with plastic to collect the stool. The health care provider will send the sample to a lab for analysis. A fecal fat test can show how well the small intestine is working.\n                \nX-ray\n                \nAn x-ray is a picture created by using radiation and recorded on film or on a computer. The amount of radiation used is small. An x-ray technician performs the x-ray at a hospital or an outpatient center, and a radiologista doctor who specializes in medical imaginginterprets the images. An x-ray of the small intestine can show that the last segment of the large intestine is narrower than normal. Blocked stool causes the part of the intestine just before this narrow segment to stretch and bulge.\n                \nUpper Gastrointestinal Series\n                \nUpper GI series, also called a barium swallow, uses x rays and fluoroscopy to help diagnose problems of the upper GI tract. Fluoroscopy is a form of x ray that makes it possible to see the internal organs and their motion on a video monitor. An x-ray technician performs this test at a hospital or an outpatient center, and a radiologist interprets the images.\n                \nDuring the procedure, the patient will stand or sit in front of an x-ray machine and drink barium, a chalky liquid. Barium coats the esophagus, stomach, and small intestine so the radiologist and a health care provider can see the shape of these organs more clearly on x-rays.\n                \nA patient may experience bloating and nausea for a short time after the test. For several days afterward, barium liquid in the GI tract causes white or light-colored stools. A health care provider will give the patient specific instructions about eating and drinking after the test. Upper GI series can show narrowing and widening of the small and large intestines.\n                \nMore information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Upper GI Series.\n                \nComputerized Tomography Scan\n                \nComputerized tomography scans use a combination of x-rays and computer technology to create images. For a...\n\n    Generated Answer: Short Bowel Syndrome (SBS) is typically diagnosed based on a patient's medical history, symptoms, and diagnostic testing results. Here are the general steps to diagnose SBS:\n\n1. Medical History: The doctor will ask about the patient's symptoms, such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, bloating, and weight loss. They will also ask about any history of intestinal surgery or disease.\n2. Physical Examination: The doctor will perform a physical exam to check for signs of dehydration, malnutrition, or other complications of SBS.\n3. Diagnostic Tests: The following tests may be ordered to confirm the diagnosis of SBS:\n* Blood tests: To check for signs of malnutrition, dehydration, and electrolyte imbalances.\n* Stool tests: To check for infection or inflammation in the digestive tract.\n* Imaging tests: Such as X-rays, CT scans, or MRIs, to evaluate the structure and function of the intestines.\n* Video Capsule Endoscopy: A small camera pill is swallowed, which...\n\n    Scoring guide:\n    1.

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: What are the treatments for Short Bowel Syndrome?\n\n    Reference Answer: A health care provider will recommend treatment for short bowel syndrome based on a patient's nutritional needs. Treatment may include\n                \n- nutritional support  - medications  - surgery  - intestinal transplant\n                \nNutritional Support\n                \nThe main treatment for short bowel syndrome is nutritional support, which may include the following:\n                \n- Oral rehydration. Adults should drink water, sports drinks, sodas without caffeine, and salty broths. Children should drink oral rehydration solutionsspecial drinks that contain salts and minerals to prevent dehydrationsuch as Pedialyte, Naturalyte, Infalyte, and CeraLyte, which are sold in most grocery stores and drugstores.  - Parenteral nutrition. This treatment delivers fluids, electrolytes, and liquid vitamins and minerals into the bloodstream through an intravenous (IV) tubea tube placed into a vein. Health care providers give parenteral nutrition to people who cannot or should not get their nutrition or enough fluids through eating.  - Enteral nutrition. This treatment delivers liquid food to the stomach or small intestine through a feeding tubea small, soft, plastic tube placed through the nose or mouth into the stomach. Gallstonessmall, pebblelike substances that develop in the gallbladderare a complication of enteral nutrition. More information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Gallstones.  - Vitamin and mineral supplements. A person may need to take vitamin and mineral supplements during or after parenteral or enteral nutrition.  - Special diet. A health care provider can recommend a specific diet plan for the patient that may include      - small, frequent feedings    - avoiding foods that can cause diarrhea, such as foods high in sugar, protein, and fiber    - avoiding high-fat foods\n                \nMedications\n                \nA health care provider may prescribe medications to treat short bowel syndrome, including\n                \n- antibiotics to prevent bacterial overgrowth  - H2 blockers to treat too much gastric acid secretion  - proton pump inhibitors to treat too much gastric acid secretion  - choleretic agents to improve bile flow and prevent liver disease  - bile-salt binders to decrease diarrhea  - anti-secretin agents to reduce gastric acid in the intestine  - hypomotility agents to increase the time it takes food to travel through the intestines, leading to increased nutrient absorption  - growth hormones to improve intestinal absorption  - teduglutide to improve intestinal absorption\n                \nSurgery\n                \nThe goal of surgery is to increase the small intestine's ability to absorb nutrients. Approximately half of the patients with short bowel syndrome need surgery.2 Surgery used to treat short bowel syndrome includes procedures that\n                \n- prevent blockage and preserve the length of the small intestine  - narrow any dilated segment of the small intestine  - slow the time it takes for food to travel through the small intestine  - lengthen the small intestine\n                \nLong-term treatment and recovery, which for some may take years, depend in part on\n                \n- what sections of the small intestine were removed  - how much of the intestine is damaged  - how well the muscles of the intestine work  - how well the remaining small intestine adapts over time\n                \nIntestinal Transplant\n                \nAn intestinal transplant is surgery to remove a diseased or an injured small intestine and replace it with a healthy small intestine from a person who has just died, called a donor. Sometimes a living donor can provide a segment of his or her small intestine.\n                \nTransplant surgeonsdoctors who specialize in performing transplant surgeryperform the surgery on patients for whom other treatments have failed and who have lifethreatening complications from long-term parenteral nutrition. An intestinal-transplant team performs the surgery in a hospital. The patient will need anesthesia. Complications of intestinal transplantation include infections and rejection of the transplanted organ.\n                \nA successful intestinal transplant can be a life-saving treatment for people with intestinal failure caused by short bowel syndrome. By 2008, transplant surgeons had performed almost 2,000 intestinal transplantations in the United Statesapproximately 75 percent of which were in patients younger than 18 years of age.3\n                \nA health care provider will tailor treatment to the severity of the patient's disease:   - Treatment for mild short bowel syndrome involves eating small, frequent meals; drinking fluid; taking nutritional supplements; and using medications to treat diarrhea.   - Treatment for moderate short bowel syndrome is similar to that for mild short bowel syndrome, with the addition of parenteral nutrition as...\n\n    Generated Answer: Treatment for Short Bowel Syndrome (SBS) typically involves a combination of nutritional support, medication, and, in some cases, surgery.\n\n1. Nutritional Support: This is the primary treatment for SBS. It often includes oral rehydration solutions, dietary modifications, and enteral nutrition (tube feeding). In severe cases, total parenteral nutrition (TPN) may be necessary, which involves delivering nutrients directly into the bloodstream through a vein.\n\n2. Medication: Various medications can help manage symptoms associated with SBS, such as diarrhea, malabsorption, and bacterial overgrowth. These may include antibiotics, antacids, anti-diarrheal drugs, and medications to enhance nutrient absorption.\n\n3. Surgery: Surgical interventions aim to either restore the function of the remaining intestine or correct anatomical issues contributing to malabsorption. Procedures might involve tapering or lengthening parts of the intestine to improve its absorptive capacity.\n\n4. Intestinal Transplant: For individuals with severe intestinal failure due to SBS, where other treatments have been ineffective, an intestinal transplant may be considered. This involves replacing the diseased portion of the intestine with a healthy one from a donor.\n\nTreatment plans are highly individualized, depending on the extent of intestinal loss, the presence of complications, and the patient's overall health status. Management of SBS requires close monitoring and adjustments over time to optimize nutritional outcomes and quality of life.",

            "raw_response": "Evaluate this medical answer based on the criteria below. Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: How to diagnose Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome?\n\n    Reference Answer: A health care provider diagnoses Zollinger-Ellison syndrome based on the following:\n                \n- medical history   - physical exam  - signs and symptoms  - blood tests  - upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy  - imaging tests to look for gastrinomas  - measurement of stomach acid\n                \nMedical History\n                \nTaking a medical and family history is one of the first things a health care provider may do to help diagnose Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. The health care provider may ask about family cases of MEN1 in particular.\n                \nPhysical Exam\n                \nA physical exam may help diagnose Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. During a physical exam, a health care provider usually\n                \n- examines a persons body  - uses a stethoscope to listen to bodily sounds  - taps on specific areas of the persons body\n                \nSigns and Symptoms\n                \nA health care provider may suspect Zollinger-Ellison syndrome if\n                \n- diarrhea accompanies peptic ulcer symptoms or if peptic ulcer treatment fails.  - a person has peptic ulcers without the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as aspirin and ibuprofen or a bacterial Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection. NSAID use and H. pylori infection may cause peptic ulcers.  - a person has severe ulcers that bleed or cause holes in the duodenum or stomach.  - a health care provider diagnoses a person or the persons family member with MEN1 or a person has symptoms of MEN1.\n                \nBlood Tests\n                \nThe health care provider may use blood tests to check for an elevated gastrin level. A technician or nurse draws a blood sample during an office visit or at a commercial facility and sends the sample to a lab for analysis. A health care provider will ask the person to fast for several hours prior to the test and may ask the person to stop acid-reducing medications for a period of time before the test. A gastrin level that is 10 times higher than normal suggests Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.2\n                \nA health care provider may also check for an elevated gastrin level after an infusion of secretin. Secretin is a hormone that causes gastrinomas to release more gastrin. A technician or nurse places an intravenous (IV) needle in a vein in the arm to give an infusion of secretin. A health care provider may suspect Zollinger-Ellison syndrome if blood drawn after the infusion shows an elevated gastrin level.\n                \nUpper Gastrointestinal Endoscopy\n                \nThe health care provider uses an upper GI endoscopy to check the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum for ulcers and esophagitisa general term used to describe irritation and swelling of the esophagus. This procedure involves using an endoscopea small, flexible tube with a lightto see the upper GI tract, which includes the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. A gastroenterologista doctor who specializes in digestive diseasesperforms the test at a hospital or an outpatient center. The gastroenterologist carefully feeds the endoscope down the esophagus and into the stomach and duodenum. A small camera mounted on the endoscope transmits a video image to a monitor, allowing close examination of the intestinal lining. A person may receive a liquid anesthetic that is gargled or sprayed on the back of the throat. A technician or nurse inserts an IV needle in a vein in the arm if anesthesia is given.\n                \nImaging Tests\n                \nTo help find gastrinomas, a health care provider may order one or more of the following imaging tests:\n                \n- Computerized tomography (CT) scan. A CT scan is an x ray that produces pictures of the body. A CT scan may include the injection of a special dye, called contrast medium. CT scans use a combination of x rays and computer technology to create images. CT scans require the person to lie on a table that slides into a tunnel-shaped device where an x-ray technician takes x rays. A computer puts the different views together to create a model of the pancreas, stomach, and duodenum. The x-ray technician performs the procedure in an outpatient center or a hospital, and a radiologista doctor who specializes in medical imaginginterprets the images. The person does not need anesthesia. CT scans can show tumors and ulcers.  - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI is a test that takes pictures of the bodys internal organs and soft tissues without using x rays. A specially trained technician performs the procedure in an outpatient center or a hospital, and a radiologist interprets the images. The person does not need anesthesia, though people with a fear of confined spaces may receive light sedation, taken by mouth. An MRI may include the injection of contrast medium. With most MRI machines, the person will lie on a table that slides into a tunnel-shaped device. Some centers offer open MRI machines that allow the person to lie on a table that is not enclosed.  - Somatostatin receptor scintigraphy (SRS). SRS is a type of nuclear medicine imaging test that creates detailed images of the pancreas and other parts of the body. A technician injects a small amount of radioactive material into a vein in the arm. The radioactive material binds to the tumor cells, and a special camera and computer create images of the tumor. A radiologist interprets the images. The person does not need anesthesia.  - Positron emission tomography (PET). PET is a type of nuclear medicine imaging test that helps find abnormal cell growth in the body. A technician injects a small amount of radioactive glucose into a vein in the arm. Abnormal cells in the body take up more glucose and appear brighter on the images. A special camera and computer create images of the tumor. A radiologist interprets the images. The person does not need anesthesia.\n                \nMeasurement of Stomach Acid\n                \nA health care provider may measure stomach acid to confirm a diagnosis of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. The health care provider passes a thin tube through the nose or mouth into the stomach to collect samples of stomach acid. The person should not eat or drink anything for several hours before the test. The health care provider may perform this test in a hospital or an outpatient center, and the person does not need anesthesia.",

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: What are the treatments for Indigestion?\n\n    Reference Answer: Some people may experience relief from symptoms of indigestion by\n                \n- eating several small, low-fat meals throughout the day at a slow pace  - refraining from smoking  - abstaining from consuming coffee, carbonated beverages, and alcohol  - stopping use of medications that may irritate the stomach liningsuch as aspirin or anti-inflammatory drugs  - getting enough rest  - finding ways to decrease emotional and physical stress, such as relaxation therapy or yoga\n                \nThe doctor may recommend over-the-counter antacids or medications that reduce acid production or help the stomach move food more quickly into the small intestine. Many of these medications can be purchased without a prescription. Nonprescription medications should only be used at the dose and for the length of time recommended on the label unless advised differently by a doctor. Informing the doctor when starting a new medication is important.\n                \nAntacids, such as Alka-Seltzer, Maalox, Mylanta, Rolaids, and Riopan, are usually the first drugs recommended to relieve symptoms of indigestion. Many brands on the market use different combinations of three basic saltsmagnesium, calcium, and aluminumwith hydroxide or bicarbonate ions to neutralize the acid in the stomach. Antacids, however, can have side effects. Magnesium salt can lead to diarrhea, and aluminum salt may cause constipation. Aluminum and magnesium salts are often combined in a single product to balance these effects.\n                \nCalcium carbonate antacids, such as Tums, Titralac, and Alka-2, can also be a supplemental source of calcium, though they may cause constipation.\n                \nH2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs) include ranitidine (Zantac), cimetidine (Tagamet), famotidine (Pepcid), and nizatidine (Axid) and are available both by prescription and over-the-counter. H2RAs treat symptoms of indigestion by reducing stomach acid. They work longer than but not as quickly as antacids. Side effects of H2RAs may include headache, nausea, vomiting, constipation, diarrhea, and unusual bleeding or bruising.\n                \nProton pump inhibitors (PPIs) include omeprazole (Prilosec, Zegerid), lansoprazole (Prevacid), pantoprazole (Protonix), rabeprazole (Aciphex), and esomeprazole (Nexium) and are available by prescription. Prilosec is also available in over-the-counter strength. PPIs, which are stronger than H2RAs, also treat indigestion symptoms by reducing stomach acid. PPIs are most effective in treating symptoms of indigestion in people who also have GERD. Side effects of PPIs may include back pain, aching, cough, headache, dizziness, abdominal pain, gas, nausea, vomiting, constipation, and diarrhea.\n                \nProkinetics such as...\n\n    Generated Answer: Indigestion, also known as...\n\n    Scoring guide:\n    1.

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: What to do for What I need to know about Physical Activity and Diabetes?\n\n    Reference Answer: - Starting a physical activity program can help you lose weight or keep a healthy weight and keep your blood glucose levels on target.  - Always talk with your health care team before you start a new physical activity program.  - Ask your health care team if you need to change the amount of medicine you take or the food you eat before any physical activity.  - Talk with your health care team about what types of physical activity are safe for you, such as walking, weightlifting, or housework.  - To make sure you stay active, find activities you like to do. Ask a friend or family member to be your exercise buddy.  - Write down your blood glucose levels and when and how long you are physically active in a record book.  - Doctors suggest that you aim for 30 to 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity most days of the week.  - Children and adolescents with type 2 diabetes who are 10 to 17 years old should aim for 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous activity every day.  - Not all physical activity has to take place at the same time. For example, you might take a walk for 20 minutes, lift hand weights for 10 minutes, and walk up and down the stairs for 5 minutes.  - Doing moderate to vigorous aerobic exercise for 30 to 60 minutes a day most days of the week provides many benefits. You can even split up these minutes into several parts.  - Start exercising slowly, with 5 to 10 minutes a day, and add a little more time each week. Try walking briskly, hiking, or climbing stairs.  - Whether youre a man or a woman, you can do strength training with hand weights, elastic bands, or weight machines two to three times a week.  - Stretching exercises are a light to moderate physical activity that both men and women can do.

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: What to do for What I need to know about Lactose Intolerance?\n\n    Reference Answer: Talk with your doctor about your dietary plan. A dietary plan can help you manage the symptoms of lactose intolerance and get enough nutrients. If you have a child with lactose intolerance, follow the diet plan that your childs doctor recommends.\n                \nMilk and milk products. You may be able to have milk and milk products without symptoms if you\n                \n- drink small amounts of milkhalf a cup or lessat a time  - drink small amounts of milk with meals, such as having milk with cereal or having cheese with crackers  - add small amounts of milk and milk products to your diet a little at a time and see how you feel  - eat milk products that are easier for people with lactose intolerance to break down:      - yogurt    - hard cheeses such as cheddar and Swiss\n                \n\n                \nLactose-free and lactose-reduced milk and milk products. You can find lactose-free and lactose-reduced milk and milk products at the grocery store. These products are just as healthy for you as regular milk and milk products.\n                \nLactase products. You can use lactase tablets and drops when you have milk and milk products. The lactase enzyme breaks down the lactose in food. Using lactase tablets or drops can help you prevent symptoms of lactose intolerance. Check with your doctor before using these products. Some people, such as young children and pregnant and breastfeeding women, may not be able to use these products.\n                \n\n                \n\n                \nCalcium and Vitamin D   If you are lactose intolerant, make sure you get enough calcium each day. Milk and milk products are the most common sources of calcium. Other foods that contain calcium include   - fish with soft bones, such as canned salmon or sardines   - broccoli and other leafy green vegetables   - oranges   - almonds, Brazil nuts, and dried beans   - tofu   - products with the label showing added calcium, such as cereals, fruit juices, and soy milk    Vitamin D helps the body absorb and use calcium. Be sure to eat foods that contain vitamin D, such as eggs, liver, and certain kinds of fish, such as salmon. Also, being outside in the sunlight helps your body make vitamin D. Some companies add vitamin D to milk and milk products. If you are able to drink small amounts...\n\n    Generated Answer: Lactose intolerance is the inability to digest lactose, a sugar found in milk and dairy products. Here's what you need to know:\n\n1. Symptoms: They usually occur within 30 minutes to 2 hours after consuming dairy. These may include bloating, diarrhea, gas, and stomach pain or cramps.\n\n2. Cause: It's often due to a lack of lactase, an enzyme produced in the small intestine that breaks down lactose into simpler sugars for absorption.\n\n3. Diagnosis: Usually based on symptoms and a hydrogen breath test or a stool acidity test for infants and...\n\n    Scoring guide:\n    1.

            "raw_response": "Evaluate this medical answer based on the criteria below. Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: What are the treatments for Proctitis?\n\n    Reference Answer: Treatment of proctitis depends on its cause. The goal of treatment is to reduce inflammation, control symptoms, and eliminate infection, if it is present. Only a doctor can determine the cause of proctitis and the best course of treatment. With proper medical attention, proctitis can be successfully treated.\n                \nProctitis from Infection\n                \nIf lab tests confirm that an STD or non-STD infection is present, medication is prescribed based on the type of infection found. Antibiotics are prescribed to kill bacteria; antiviral medications are prescribed to treat viruses. Although some STD viruses cannot be eliminated, antivirals can control their symptoms.\n                \nProctitis from Other Causes\n                \nIf antibiotic use triggered proctitis, the doctor may prescribe a different antibiotic designed to destroy the harmful bacteria that have developed in the intestines.\n                \nIf proctitis is caused by anorectal trauma, the activity causing the inflammation should be stopped. Healing usually occurs in 4 to 6 weeks. The doctor may recommend over-the-counter medications such as antidiarrheals and those used for pain relief, such as aspirin and ibuprofen.\n                \nTreatment of radiation proctitis is based on symptoms. Radiation proctitis causing only mild symptoms such as occasional bleeding or tenesmus may heal without treatment. For people with persistent or severe bleeding, thermal therapy may be used to stop bleeding and inflammation. Thermal therapy is done during flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy and targets the rectal lining with a heat probe, electric current, or laser. Argon plasma coagulation is the most common thermal therapy used to control bleeding in radiation proctitis. In many cases, several treatments are required. Obstruction that results from a stricturea narrowing of the rectumcaused by radiation proctitis may be treated with stool softeners in mild cases. In people with narrower strictures, dilation to enlarge the narrow area may be required. Sucralfate, 5-aminosalicylic acidknown as 5-ASAor corticosteroid enemas can also be used to ease pain and reduce inflammation from radiation proctitis, although their effectiveness is limited.\n                \nWhen a chronic IBD such as ulcerative colitis or Crohns disease causes proctitis, treatment aims to reduce inflammation, control symptoms, and induce and maintain remissiona period when the person is symptom-free. Treatment depends on the extent and severity of the disease.\n                \nAnti-inflammation medications. Mild proctitis can often be effectively treated with topical mesalamine, either suppositories or enemas.\n                \nSome people with IBD and proctitis cannot tolerateor may have an incomplete response torectal therapy with 5-ASA suppositories or enemas. For these people, the doctor may prescribe oral medications alone or in combination with rectal therapy. Oral medications commonly used for proctitis contain salicylate. These include sulfasalazine- or mesalamine-containing medications, such as Asacol, Dipentum, or Pentasa. Possible side effects of oral administration of sulfasalazine- or mesalaminecontaining medications include nausea, vomiting, heartburn, diarrhea, and headache. Improvement in symptoms, including a decrease in bleeding, can occur within a few days, although complete healing requires 4 to 6 weeks of therapy.\n                \nCortisone or steroids. These medications, also called corticosteroids, are effective at reducing inflammation. Prednisone and budesonide are generic names of two medications in this group. Corticosteroids for proctitis may be taken in pill, suppository, or enema form. When symptoms are at their worst, corticosteroids are usually prescribed in a large dose. The dosage is then gradually lowered once symptoms are controlled. Corticosteroids can cause serious side effects, including greater susceptibility to infection and osteoporosis, or weakening of the bones.\n                \nImmune system suppressors. Medications that suppress the immune systemcalled immunosuppressive medicationsare also used to treat proctitis. The most commonly prescribed medication is 6-mercaptopurine or a related medication, azathioprine. Immunosuppressive medications work by blocking the immune reaction that contributes to inflammation. These medications may cause side effects such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea and may lower a persons resistance to infection. Some patients are treated with a combination of corticosteroids and immunosuppressive medications. Some studies suggest that immunosuppressive medications may enhance the effectiveness of corticosteroids.\n                \nInfliximab (Remicade). Researchers have found that high levels of a protein produced by the immune system, called tumor necrosis factor (TNF), are present in people with Crohns disease. Infliximab is the first of a group of medications that bind to TNF and block its action. This reduces inflammation and heals the intestinal tract. Infliximab has been shown to be highly effective in treating moderate-to-severe Crohns disease that does not respond to other therapies. Side effects of infliximab include reactions to the infusion, which can be reduced by premedication with acetaminophen and diphenhydramine. Other possible side effects include increased risk of infections, lymphoma, and nerve damage.\n                \nSurgery. Surgery is sometimes necessary to remove damaged portions of the intestine. Surgery is considered only after all other options have failed and the person is experiencing complications such as bowel obstruction, fistulas, abscesses, or severe hemorrhage. Surgery may also be necessary if there is a narrowingstrictureof the intestine or if precancerous lesions are detected.\n                \nNutritional Therapy\n                \nPeople with proctitis may experience weight loss due to chronic diarrhea, abdominal pain, and decreased appetite. Nutritional therapy can help manage these symptoms. A registered dietitian can help develop a personalized nutrition plan. The goals of nutritional therapy are to\n                \nMaintain or increase weight\n                Reduce symptoms\n                Induce and maintain remission\n                Improve overall health\n                \nThe dietitian will consider the following factors when developing a nutrition plan\n                \nDietary restrictions\n                Food allergies or intolerances\n                Nutrient deficiencies\n                Overall health status\n                \nA well-balanced diet that includes a variety of foods from all food groups can help manage proctitis symptoms. Foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids, antioxidants, and fiber may be particularly beneficial. Examples of these foods include\n                \n\nFatty fishsuch as salmon and sardines\n                Nuts and seeds\n                Leafy greenssuch as spinach and kale\n                Berriessuch as blueberries and raspberries\n                Legumes, such as lentils and chickpeas\n                \nAvoiding trigger foods can also help manage symptoms. Common trigger foods include\n                \n\nDairy products\n                Gluten\n                High-fiber foods\n                Spicy foods\n                Caffeine\n                \nIn some cases, enteral nutrition may be recommended. Enteral nutrition involves delivering nutrients directly into the gastrointestinal tract through a feeding tube. This can help manage symptoms and promote healing in the digestive tract. Parenteral nutrition may also be necessary in some cases, especially if the person is unable to absorb enough nutrients from food. Parenteral nutrition involves delivering nutrients intravenouslythrough a vein.",

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: What causes Insulin Resistance and Prediabetes?\n\n    Reference Answer: Although the exact causes of insulin resistance are not completely understood, scientists think the major contributors to insulin resistance are excess weight and physical inactivity.\n                \nExcess Weight\n                \nSome experts believe obesity, especially excess fat around the waist, is a primary cause of insulin resistance. Scientists used to think that fat tissue functioned solely as energy storage. However, studies have shown that belly fat produces hormones and other substances that can cause serious health problems such as insulin resistance, high blood pressure, imbalanced cholesterol, and cardiovascular disease (CVD).\n                \nBelly fat plays a part in developing chronic, or long-lasting, inflammation in the body. Chronic inflammation can damage the body over time, without any signs or symptoms. Scientists have found that complex interactions in fat tissue draw immune cells to the area and trigger low-level chronic inflammation. This inflammation can contribute to the development of insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and CVD. Studies show that losing the weight can reduce insulin resistance and prevent or delay type 2 diabetes.\n                \nPhysical Inactivity\n                \nMany studies have shown that physical inactivity is associated with insulin resistance, often leading to type 2 diabetes. In the body, more glucose is used by muscle than other tissues. Normally, active muscles burn their stored glucose for energy and refill their reserves with glucose taken from the bloodstream, keeping blood glucose levels in balance.\n                \nStudies show that after exercising, muscles become more sensitive to insulin, reversing insulin resistance and lowering blood glucose levels. Exercise also helps muscles absorb more glucose without the need for insulin. The more muscle a body has, the more glucose it can burn to control blood glucose levels.\n                \nOther Causes\n                \nOther causes of insulin resistance may include ethnicity; certain diseases; hormones; steroid use; some medications; older age; sleep problems, especially sleep apnea; and cigarette smoking.\n                \n\n                \nDoes sleep matter?   Yes. Studies show that untreated sleep problems, especially sleep apnea, can increase the risk of obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes. Night shift workers may also be at increased risk for these problems. Sleep apnea is a common disorder in which a person's breathing is interrupted during sleep. People may often move out of deep sleep...\n\n    Generated Answer: Insulin resistance and prediabetes are related conditions that are caused by a combination of genetic and lifestyle factors.\n\nInsulin resistance occurs when the body's cells become less responsive to insulin, a hormone that regulates blood sugar levels. This causes the body to produce more insulin to maintain normal blood sugar levels, leading to high insulin levels in the blood.\n\nPrediabetes is a condition in which blood sugar levels are higher than normal but not high enough to be diagnosed as diabetes. It is often a precursor to type 2 diabetes and is frequently caused by insulin resistance.\n\nSome of the factors that contribute to insulin resistance and prediabetes include:\n\n1. Genetics: Having a family history of diabetes or insulin resistance increases the risk of developing these conditions.\n2. Weight: Being overweight or obese is a significant risk factor for insulin resistance and prediabetes. Excess body fat, particularly in the abdominal area, can interfere with the body's ability to use insulin effectively.\n3. Physical inactivity: Lack of regular physical activity can contribute to insulin resistance and prediabetes by making it harder for the body to use insulin effectively.\n4. Diet: A diet high in processed foods, sugary drinks, and unhealthy fats can increase...\n\n    Scoring guide:\n    1. Scientific Consensus: 1=Aligned, 0=No consensus, -1=Opposed\n    2.

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: How to diagnose Insulin Resistance and Prediabetes?\n\n    Reference Answer: Health care providers use blood tests to determine whether a person has prediabetes, but they do not usually test specifically for insulin resistance. Insulin resistance can be assessed by measuring the level of insulin in the blood.\n                \nHowever, the test that most accurately measures insulin resistance, called the euglycemic clamp, is too costly and complicated to be used in most health care providers' offices. The clamp is a research tool used by scientists to learn more about glucose metabolism. Research has shown that if blood tests indicate prediabetes, insulin resistance most likely is present.\n                \nBlood Tests for Prediabetes\n                \nAll blood tests involve drawing blood at a health care provider's office or commercial facility and sending the sample to a lab for analysis. Lab analysis of blood is needed to ensure test results are accurate. Glucose measuring devices used in a health care provider's office, such as finger-stick devices, are not accurate enough for diagnosis but may be used as a quick indicator of high blood glucose.\n                \nPrediabetes can be detected with one of the following blood tests:\n                \n- the A1C test  - the fasting plasma glucose (FPG) test  - the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)\n                \nA1C test. Sometimes called hemoglobin A1c, HbA1c, or glycohemoglobin test, this test reflects average blood glucose levels over the past 3 months. This test is the most reliable test for prediabetes, but it is not as sensitive as the other tests. In some individuals, it may miss prediabetes that could be caught by glucose tests.\n                \nAlthough some health care providers can quickly measure A1C in their office, that type of measurementcalled a point-of-care testis not considered reliable for diagnosis. For diagnosis of prediabetes, the A1C test should be analyzed in a laboratory using a method that is certified by the NGSP.\n                \nThe A1C test can be unreliable for diagnosing prediabetes in people with certain conditions that are known to interfere with the results. Interference should be suspected when A1C results seem very different from the results of a blood glucose test. People of African, Mediterranean, or Southeast Asian descent, or people with family members with sickle cell anemia or a thalassemia, are particularly at risk of interference. People in these groups may have a less common type of hemoglobin, known as a hemoglobin variant, that can interfere with some A1C tests.\n                \nAn A1C of 5.7 to 6.4 percent indicates prediabetes.\n                \nMore information about the A1C test is provided in the NIDDK health topic, The A1C Test and Diabetes.\n                \nFasting plasma glucose test. This test measures blood glucose in people who have not eaten anything for at least 8 hours. This test is most reliable when done in the morning. Prediabetes found with this test is called IFG.\n              ...\n\n    Generated Answer: Insulin resistance and prediabetes are typically diagnosed through a combination of medical history, physical examination, and diagnostic tests.\n\nTo diagnose insulin resistance, doctors often use a method called the Homeostasis Model Assessment (HOMA) to estimate insulin resistance based on fasting insulin and glucose levels. However, there is no standardized test to diagnose insulin resistance, and it is often identified based on other risk factors and symptoms.\n\nPrediabetes is typically diagnosed through a fasting plasma glucose test, an oral glucose tolerance test, or an A1C test. A fasting plasma glucose test measures your blood sugar level after an overnight fast. An oral glucose...\n\n    Scoring guide:\n    1.

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: What to do for Insulin Resistance and Prediabetes?\n\n    Reference Answer: Adopting healthy eating habits can help people lose a modest amount of weight and reverse insulin resistance. Experts encourage people to slowly adopt healthy eating habits that they can maintain, rather than trying extreme weight-loss solutions. People may need to get help from a dietitian or join a weight-loss program for support.\n                \nIn general, people should lose weight by choosing healthy foods, controlling portions, eating less fat, and increasing physical activity. People are better able to lose weight and keep it off when they learn how to adapt their favorite foods to a healthy eating plan.\n                \nThe DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) eating plan, developed by the NIH, has been shown to be effective in decreasing insulin resistance when combined with weight loss and physical activity. More information on DASH is available at www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/dash.\n                \nThe U.S. Dietary Guidelines for Americans also offers healthy eating advice and tools for changing eating habits at www.choosemyplate.gov.\n                \nDietary Supplements\n                \nVitamin D studies show a link between people's ability to maintain healthy blood glucose levels and having enough vitamin D in their blood. However, studies to determine the proper vitamin D levels for preventing diabetes are ongoing; no special recommendations have been made about vitamin D levels or supplements for people with prediabetes.\n                \nCurrently, the Institute of Medicine (IOM), the agency that recommends supplementation levels based on current science, provides the following guidelines for daily vitamin D intake:\n                \n- People ages 1 to 70 years may require 600 International Units (IUs).  - People ages 71 and older may require as much as 800 IUs.\n                \nThe IOM also recommended that no more than 4,000 IUs of vitamin D be taken per day.\n                \nTo help ensure coordinated and safe care, people should discuss use of complementary and alternative medicine practices, including the use of dietary supplements, with their health care provider.\n                \nMore information about using dietary supplements to help with diabetes is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Complementary and Alternative Medical Therapies for Diabetes.\n                \n\n                \nPhysical Activity\n                \nRegular physical activity tackles several risk factors at once. Regular physical activity helps the body use insulin properly.\n                \nRegular physical activity also helps a person\n                \n- lose weight  - control blood glucose levels  - control blood pressure  - control cholesterol levels\n                \nPeople in the DPP who were physically active for 30 minutes a day, 5 days a week, reduced their risk of type 2 diabetes. Many chose brisk walking as their physical activity.\n                \nMost people should aim for at least 30 minutes of exercise most days of the week. For best results, people should do both aerobic activities, which use large muscle groups and make the heart beat faster, and muscle strengthening activities.\n                \nAerobic activities include brisk walking, climbing stairs, swimming, dancing, and other activities that increase the heart rate.\n                \nMuscle strengthening activities include lifting weights and doing sit-ups or push-ups.\n                \nPeople who haven't been physically active recently should talk with their health care provider about which activities are best for them and have a checkup before starting an exercise program.\n                \nNot Smoking\n                \nThose who smoke should quit. A health care provider can help people find ways to quit smoking. Studies show that people who get help have a better chance of quitting.\n                \nFor more information about how to reverse insulin resistance and prediabetes with diet and increased physical activity, see the following National Diabetes Education Program publications at www.yourdiabetesinfo.org:    - Get Real! You Don't Have to Knock Yourself Out to Prevent Diabetes!   - More Than 50 Ways to Prevent Diabetes   - Small Steps. Big Rewards. Your Game Plan to Prevent Type 2 Diabetes.\n                \nMedication\n                \nThe medication metformin is recommended for treatment of some individuals at very high risk of developing type 2 diabetes. In the DPP, metformin was shown to be most effective in preventing or delaying the development of type 2 diabetes in younger, heavier people with prediabetes. In general, metformin is recommend for those who are younger than age 60 and have\n                \n- combined IGT and IFG  - A1C above 6 percent  - low HDL cholesterol  - elevated triglycerides  - a parent or sibling with diabetes  - a BMI of at least 35\n                \nMetformin also lowers the risk of diabetes in women who have had gestational diabetes. People at high risk should ask their health care provider if they should take metformin...\n\n    Generated Answer: If you have been diagnosed with insulin resistance and prediabetes, here are some steps you can take:\n\n1. Lifestyle modifications: Making changes to your lifestyle can have a significant impact on managing insulin resistance and prediabetes. This includes:\n* Eating a healthy diet: Focus on consuming whole, unprocessed foods like vegetables, fruits, lean proteins, and whole grains. Avoid sugary drinks and refined carbohydrates.\n* Increasing physical activity: Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise, or a combination of both, per week. Additionally, incorporate strength-training exercises into your routine.\n* Maintaining a healthy weight: If you're overweight or obese, losing weight can help improve insulin sensitivity.\n* Getting enough sleep: Aim for 7-8 hours of sleep per night to help regulate blood sugar levels.\n* Managing stress: Engage in stress-reducing activities like yoga, meditation, or deep breathing exercises.\n\n2. Medications: In some cases, medications like metformin may be prescribed to help manage insulin resistance and prediabetes. Metformin works by improving insulin sensitivity and reducing glucose production in the liver.\n\n3. Monitoring: Regularly monitoring your blood sugar levels, blood pressure, and lipid profiles can help identify any changes or potential complications early on.\n\n4. Seeking professional guidance: Consult with your healthcare provider or a registered dietitian to create a personalized plan tailored to your specific needs and health goals.\n\nRemember, making these lifestyle changes and working closely with your healthcare team can significantly reduce your risk of developing type 2 diabetes and related complications.",

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: How to diagnose Crohn's Disease?\n\n    Reference Answer: A health care provider diagnoses Crohn's disease with the following:\n                \n- medical and family history  - physical exam  - lab tests  - upper GI series  - computerized tomography (CT) scan  - intestinal endoscopy\n                \nThe health care provider may perform a series of medical tests to rule out other bowel diseases, such as irritable bowel syndrome, ulcerative colitis, or celiac disease, that cause symptoms similar to those of Crohn's disease.\n                \nMedical and Family History\n                \nTaking a medical and family history can help a health care provider diagnose Crohn's disease and understand a patient's symptoms. He or she will ask the patient to describe his or her\n                \n- family history  - symptoms  - current and past medical conditions  - current medications\n                \nPhysical Exam\n                \nA physical exam may help diagnose Crohn's disease. During a physical exam, the health care provider most often\n                \n- checks for abdominal distension, or swelling  - listens to sounds within the abdomen using a stethoscope  - taps on the abdomen to check for tenderness and pain and establish if the liver or spleen is abnormal or enlarged\n                \nLab Tests\n                \nA health care provider may order lab tests, including blood and stool tests.\n                \nBlood tests. A blood test involves drawing blood at a health care provider's office or a lab. A lab technologist will analyze the blood sample. A health care provider may use blood tests to look for changes in\n                \n- red blood cells. When red blood cells are fewer or smaller than normal, a patient may have anemia.  - white blood cells. When the white blood cell count is higher than normal, a person may have inflammation or infection somewhere in his or her body.\n                \nStool tests. A stool test is the analysis of a sample of stool. A health care provider will give the patient a container for catching and storing the stool at home. The patient returns the sample to the health care provider or to a lab. A lab technologist will analyze the stool sample. Health care providers commonly order stool tests to rule out other causes of GI diseases.\n                \nUpper Gastrointestinal Series\n                \nAn upper GI series, also called a barium swallow, uses x-rays and fluoroscopy to help diagnose problems of the upper GI tract. Fluoroscopy is a form of x-ray that makes it possible to see the internal organs and their motion on a video monitor. An x-ray technician performs this test at a hospital or an outpatient center, and a radiologista doctor who specializes in medical imaginginterprets the images.\n                \nThis test does not require anesthesia. A patient should not eat or drink before the procedure, as directed by the health care provider. Patients should ask their health care provider about how to prepare for an upper GI series.\n                \nDuring the procedure, the patient will stand or sit in front of an x-ray machine and drink barium, a chalky liquid. Barium coats the esophagus, stomach, and small intestine so the radiologist and a health care provider can see the shape of these organs more clearly on x-rays.\n                \nA patient may experience bloating and nausea for a short time after the test. For several days afterward, barium liquid in the GI tract causes white or light-colored stools. A health care provider will give the patient specific instructions about eating and drinking after the test.\n                \nComputerized Tomography Scan\n                \nComputerized tomography scans use a combination of x-rays and computer technology to create images. For a CT scan, a health care provider may give the patient a solution to drink and an injection of a special dye, called contrast medium. CT scans require the patient to lie on a table that slides into a tunnel-shaped device where the x-rays are taken. An x-ray technician performs the procedure in an outpatient center or a hospital, and a radiologist interprets the images. The patient does not need anesthesia. CT scans can diagnose both Crohn's disease and the complications seen with the disease.\n                \nIntestinal Endoscopy\n                \nIntestinal endoscopies are the most accurate methods for diagnosing Crohn's disease and ruling out other possible conditions, such as ulcerative colitis, diverticular disease, or cancer. Intestinal endoscopies include\n                \n- upper GI endoscopy and enteroscopy  - capsule endoscopy  - colonoscopy\n                \nUpper GI endoscopy and enteroscopy. An upper GI endoscopy is a procedure that uses an endoscopea small, flexible tube with a lightto directly visualize the lining of the upper GI tract. A health care provider performs the procedure at a hospital or an outpatient center. A nurse or technician may give the patient a liquid anesthetic to gargle or will spray the anesthetic on the back of a patient's throat. The anesthetic numbs the throat and calms the gag reflex. The nurse or technician will then place an intravenous needle in a vein in the arm so the sedative can be given during the procedure, which induces moderate sedation. Once the patient is sedated, the health care provider gently inserts the endoscope through the mouth and guides it through the upper GI tract. Air is pumped into the GI tract to make it easier to see inside. The air temporarily inflates the belly, which may cause discomfort.\n                \nThe health care provider can view the inside of the upper GI tract on a video monitor. The procedure takes about 1 hour. The patient will likely feel drowsy for 1 to 2 hours after the procedure. Arrangements should be made for getting the patient home.\n                \nEnteroscopy is a type of endoscopy used to examine the small intestine. Enteroscopy is performed only at certain medical centers.\n                \nCapsule endoscopy. Capsule endoscopy is a procedure that allows a health care provider to examine the lining of the middle part of the GI tractfor example, the middle and lower sections of the small intestinewithout cutting the skin. It is helpful in detecting Crohn's disease, ulcers, and tumors in the small intestine. In capsule endoscopy, the patient swallows a capsule containing a tiny camera, a light source, a battery, and a transmitter. As the capsule travels through the digestive tract, it sends signals to a computer worn on a belt around the waist. The computer records the video pictures from the camera for 8 hours. After ingesting the capsule, the patient can continue daily activities while wearing the data recorder. The capsule passes out of the body in the stool without needing to be retrieved.\n                \nColonoscopy. Colonoscopy is similar to an upper GI endoscopy but examines the large intestine instead of the upper GI tract. This procedure is useful in evaluating symptoms such as abdominal pain, rectal bleeding, and changes in bowel movements. A colonoscopy can also detect early signs of colorectal cancer and can help determine the extent of inflammatory bowel disease. To prepare for the procedure, patients may need to follow a clear liquid diet for 1 to 3 days beforehand. They will also take laxatives and enemas to clean out the bowel. A health care provider may provide additional instructions.\n                \nDuring the procedure, the patient lies on his or her side or back. A nurse or technician gives the patient conscious sedation, an intravenous medication that induces relaxation and reduces anxiety during the procedure. Once the patient is relaxed, the health care provider",

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: What are the treatments for Crohn's Disease?\n\n    Reference Answer: A health care provider treats Crohn's disease with\n                \n- medications  - bowel rest  - surgery\n                \nWhich treatment a person needs depends on the severity of the disease and symptoms. Each person experiences Crohn's disease differently, so health care providers adjust treatments to improve the person's symptoms and induce, or bring about, remission.\n                \nMedications\n                \nWhile no medication cures Crohn's disease, many can reduce symptoms. The goals of medication therapy are\n                \n- inducing and maintaining remission  - improving the person's quality of life\n                \nMany people with Crohn's disease require medication therapy. Health care providers will prescribe medications depending on the person's symptoms:\n                \n- aminosalicylates  - corticosteroids  - immunomodulators  - biologic therapies  - other medications\n                \nAminosalicylates are medications that contain 5-aminosalicyclic acid (5-ASA), which helps control inflammation. Health care providers use aminosalicylates to treat people newly diagnosed with Crohn's disease who have mild symptoms. Aminosalicylates include\n                \n- balsalazide  - mesalamine  - olsalazine  - sulfasalazinea combination of sulfapyridine and 5-ASA\n                \nSome of the common side effects of aminosalicylates include\n                \n- abdominal pain  - diarrhea  - headaches  - heartburn  - nausea and vomiting\n                \nCorticosteroids, also known as steroids, help reduce the activity of the immune system and decrease inflammation. Health care providers prescribe corticosteroids for people with moderate to severe symptoms. Corticosteroids include\n                \n- budesonide  - hydrocortisone  - methylprednisone  - prednisone\n                \nSide effects of corticosteroids include\n                \n- acne  - a higher chance of developing infections  - bone mass loss  - high blood glucose  - high blood pressure  - mood swings  - weight gain\n                \nIn most cases, health care providers do not prescribe corticosteroids for long-term use.\n                \nImmunomodulators reduce immune system activity, resulting in less inflammation in the GI tract. These medications can take several weeks to 3 months to start working. Immunomodulators include\n                \n- 6-mercaptopurine, or 6-MP  - azathioprine  - cyclosporine  - methotrexate\n                \nHealth care providers prescribe these medications to help people with Crohn's disease go into remission or to help people who do not respond to other treatments. People taking these medications may have the following side effects:\n                \n- a low white blood cell count, which can lead to a higher chance of infection  - fatigue, or feeling tired  - nausea and vomiting  - pancreatitis\n                \nHealth care providers most often prescribe cyclosporine only to people with severe Crohn's disease because of the medication's serious side effects. People should talk with their health care provider about the risks and benefits of cyclosporine.\n                \nBiologic therapies are medications that target a protein made by the immune system. Neutralizing this protein decreases inflammation in the intestine. Biologic therapies work quickly to bring on remission, especially in people who do not respond to other medications. Biologic therapies include\n                \n- adalimumab  - certolizumab  - infliximab  - natalizumab  - vedolizumab\n                \nHealth care providers most often give patients infliximab every 6 to 8 weeks at a hospital or an outpatient center. Side effects may include a toxic reaction to the medication and a higher chance of developing infections, particularly tuberculosis.\n                \nOther medications to treat symptoms or complications may include\n                \n- acetaminophen for mild pain. People with Crohn's disease should avoid using ibuprofen, naproxen, and aspirin since these medications can make symptoms worse.  - antibiotics to prevent or treat infections and fistulas.  - loperamide to help slow or stop severe diarrhea. In most cases, people only take this medication for short periods of time since it can increase the chance of developing megacolon.\n                \nBowel Rest\n                \nSometimes Crohn's disease symptoms are severe and a person may need to rest his or her bowel for a few days to several weeks. Bowel rest involves drinking only clear liquids or having no oral intake. To provide the patient with nutrition, a health care provider will deliver IV nutrition through a special catheter, or tube, inserted into a vein in the patient's arm. Some patients stay in the hospital, while other patients are able to receive the treatment at home. In most cases, the intestines are able to heal during bowel rest.\n                \nSurgery\n                \nEven with medication treatments, up to 20 percent of people will need surgery to treat their Crohn's disease.1 Although surgery does not cure Crohn's disease, it can treat complications such as\n                \n- abscesses  - bowel obstruction  - fistulas  - narrowing of the intestine\n                \nSurgeons perform two types of surgery to treat Crohn's disease:\n                \n- Proctocolectomy is a surgical procedure that removes part or all of the rectum and colon. Surgeons usually reserve proctocolectomy for people with ulcerative colitis, but sometimes they perform the surgery on people with Crohn's disease.  - Resection is a surgical procedure that removes a damaged portion of the digestive tract and then reconnects the remaining healthy portions. Surgeons perform resection when complications such as blockages, fistulas, or abscesses occur in a specific area of the intestine.\n                \nAfter surgery, a person's lifestyle may change significantly. For example, a person may need to follow a special diet or eat more frequently. In some cases, a person may need to wear a pouch on the outside of the body to collect stool. This pouch is attached to an opening in the abdomen called an ostomy.\n                \nThe goal of treatment is to reduce symptoms, maintain remission, and improve quality of life. With proper treatment, most people with Crohn's disease are able to manage their condition effectively.\n\n\n\nAnswer: Medications, bowel rest, and surgery are used to treat Crohn's disease. Medications aim to induce and maintain remission, improve quality of life, and reduce symptoms. Types of medications include aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, immunomodulators, biologic therapies, and others. Bowel rest involves resting the bowel for a few days to several weeks, and surgery may be necessary to treat complications such as abscesses, bowel obstruction, fistulas, and narrowing of the intestine.",

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: How to diagnose Whipple Disease?\n\n    Reference Answer: A health care provider may use several tests and exams to diagnose Whipple disease, including the following:\n                \n- medical and family history  - physical exam  - blood tests  - upper GI endoscopy and enteroscopy\n                \nA patient may be referred to a gastroenterologista doctor who specializes in digestive diseases.\n                \nA health care provider may first try to rule out more common conditions with similar symptoms, including\n                \n- inflammatory rheumatic diseasecharacterized by inflammation and loss of function in one or more connecting or supporting structures of the body.  - celiac diseasea digestive disease that damages the small intestine and interferes with the absorption of nutrients from food. People who have celiac disease cannot tolerate gluten, a protein in wheat, rye, and barley.  - neurologic diseasesdisorders of the central nervous system.  - intra-abdominal lymphomaabdominal cancer in part of the immune system called the lymphatic system.  - Mycobacterium avium complexan infection that affects people with AIDS.\n                \nMedical and Family History\n                \nTaking a family and medical history can help a health care provider diagnose Whipple disease.\n                \nPhysical Exam\n                \nA physical exam may help diagnose Whipple disease. During a physical exam, a health care provider usually\n                \n- examines a patients body  - uses a stethoscope to listen to sounds related to the abdomen  - taps on specific areas of the patients body checking for pain or tenderness\n                \nBlood Tests\n                \nA technician or nurse draws a blood sample during an office visit or at a commercial facility and sends the sample to a lab for analysis. The health care provider may use blood tests to check for\n                \n- malabsorption. When the damaged villi do not absorb certain nutrients from food, the body has a shortage of protein, calories, and vitamins. Blood tests can show shortages of protein, calories, and vitamins in the body.  - abnormal levels of electrolytes. Electrolyteschemicals in body fluids, including sodium, potassium, magnesium, and chlorideregulate a persons nerve and muscle function. A patient who has malabsorption or a lot of diarrhea may lose fluids and electrolytes, causing an imbalance in the body.  - anemia. Anemia is a condition in which the body has fewer red blood cells than normal. A patient with Whipple disease does not absorb the proper nutrients to make enough red blood cells in the body, leading to anemia.  - T. whipplei DNA. Although not yet approved, rapid polymerase chain reaction diagnostic tests have been developed to detect T. whipplei DNA and may be useful in diagnosis.\n                \nUpper Gastrointestinal Endoscopy and Enteroscopy\n                \nAn upper GI endoscopy and enteroscopy are procedures that use an endoscopea small, flexible tube with a lightto see the upper GI tract. A health care provider performs these tests at a hospital or an outpatient center. The health care provider carefully feeds the endoscope down the esophagus and into the stomach and duodenum.\n                \nOnce the endoscope is in the duodenum, the health care provider will use smaller tools and a smaller scope to see more of the small intestine. These additional procedures may include\n                \n- push enteroscopy, which uses a long endoscope to examine the upper portion of the small intestine.  - double-balloon enteroscopy, which uses balloons to help move the endoscope through the entire small intestine.  - capsule enteroscopy, during which the patient swallows a capsule containing a tiny camera. As the capsule passes through the GI tract, the camera will transmit images to a video monitor. Using this procedure, the health care provider can examine the entire digestive tract.\n                \nA small camera mounted on the endoscope transmits a video image to a monitor, allowing close examination of the intestinal lining. A health care provider may give a patient a liquid anesthetic to gargle or may spray anesthetic on the back of the patients throat. A health care provider will place an intravenous (IV) needle in a vein in the arm or hand to administer sedation. Sedatives help patients stay relaxed and comfortable. The test can show changes in the lining of the small intestine that can occur with Whipple disease.\n                \nThe health care provider can use tiny tools passed through the endoscope to perform biopsies. A biopsy is a procedure that involves taking a piece of tissue for...\n\n    Generated Answer: Whipple's disease is a rare systemic bacterial infection caused by the bacterium Tropheryma whipplei. The diagnosis of Whipple's disease is often challenging due to its nonspecific symptoms, which can mimic other conditions. Here are the steps to diagnose Whipple's disease:\n\n1. Medical history and physical examination: A healthcare provider will take a detailed medical history and perform a physical examination to assess the patient's symptoms and identify any potential risk factors.\n2. Laboratory tests: Blood tests may be ordered to evaluate the patient's nutritional status, liver function, and complete blood count. Stool tests may also be performed to detect the presence of T. whipplei.\n3. Imaging studies: Imaging studies such as computed tomography (CT) scans or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans may be used to evaluate the extent of the disease and detect any complications.\n4. Endoscopy and biopsy: An upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and biopsy may be performed to visualize the small intestine and obtain tissue samples for histopathological examination.\n5. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR): PCR testing may be used to detect the genetic material of T. whipplei in stool, blood, or tissue samples.\n6. Histopathological examination: Tissue samples obtained during endoscopy or biopsy are examined under a microscope to look for characteristic histopathological features of Whipple's disease, such as the presence of PAS-positive macrophages.\n\nIt is essential to note that a definitive diagnosis of Whipple's disease requires the detection of T. whipplei in a tissue sample or the presence of characteristic histopathological features in a biopsy specimen.",

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: What are the treatments for Whipple Disease?\n\n    Reference Answer: The health care provider prescribes antibiotics to destroy the T. whipplei bacteria and treat Whipple disease. Health care providers choose antibiotics that treat the infection in the small intestine and cross the blood-brain barriera layer of tissue around the brain. Using antibiotics that cross the blood-brain barrier ensures destruction of any bacteria that may have entered the patients brain and central nervous system.\n                \nThe health care provider usually prescribes IV antibiotics for the first 2 weeks of treatment. Most patients feel relief from symptoms within the first week or two. A nurse or technician places an IV in the patients arm to give the antibiotics. IV antibiotics used to treat Whipple disease may include\n                \n- ceftriaxone (Rocephin)  - meropenem (Merrem I.V.)  - penicillin G (Pfizerpen)  - streptomycin (Streptomycin)\n                \nAfter a patient completes the IV antibiotics, the health care provider will prescribe long-term oral antibiotics. Patients receive long-term treatmentat least 1 to 2 yearsto cure the infection anywhere in the body. Oral antibiotics may include\n                \n- trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (Septra, Bactrim)a combination antibiotic  - doxycycline (Vibramycin)\n                \nPatients should finish the prescribed course of antibiotics to ensure the medication destroyed all T. whipplei bacteria in the body. Patients who feel better may still have the bacteria in the small intestine or other areas of the body for 1 to 2 years. A health care provider will monitor the patient closely, repeat the blood tests, and repeat the upper GI endoscopy with biopsy during and after treatment to determine whether T. whipplei is still present.\n                \nPeople may relapse during or after treatment. A health care provider will prescribe additional or new antibiotics if a relapse occurs. Some people will relapse years after treatment, so it is important for patients to schedule routine follow-ups with the health care provider. Most...\n\n    Generated Answer: Whipple disease is a rare bacterial infection that affects multiple organ systems, particularly the gastrointestinal tract. The primary treatment for Whipple disease is antibiotic therapy, usually involving intravenous administration of antibiotics such as ceftriaxone or meropenem for at least 2 weeks, followed by oral antibiotics (such as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or doxycycline) for 12 to 18 months. This long-term antibiotic therapy is essential to ensure complete eradication of the bacteria and prevent relapse.\n\nAdditionally, patients with Whipple disease may...\n\n    Scoring guide:\n    1.

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: How to diagnose What I need to know about Crohn's Disease?\n\n    Reference Answer: A doctor will perform a physical exam and tests to diagnose Crohns disease. During your visit, the doctor will ask about your symptoms and medical history.\n                \nThe doctor may order blood tests, which involve drawing blood at a health care providers office or commercial facility and sending the sample to a lab for analysis. Blood tests can show anemia caused by bleeding. Anemia is a condition in which red blood cells are fewer or smaller than normal, which means less oxygen is carried to the bodys cells. Blood tests can also show a high white blood cell count, a sign of chronic inflammation.\n                \n\n                \nYou may also be asked for a stool sample. A stool test is commonly used to rule out other causes of GI diseases, such as infections. The doctor will give you a container for catching and storing the stool. The sample is returned to the doctor or a commercial facility and sent to a lab for analysis. A stool sample can also be used to check if you have bleeding or inflammation.\n                \nOther tests may be needed to diagnose Crohn's disease. The following tests are all performed at a hospital or outpatient center.\n                \n- Colonoscopy. Colonoscopy is the most commonly used test to specifically diagnose Crohns disease. This test is used to look inside your rectum, entire colon, and ileum. The health care provider will give you written bowel prep instructions to follow at home before the test. You may need to follow a clear liquid diet for 1 to 3 days before the test. You will need to take laxatives and enemas the evening before the test, and you will likely have one or more enemas about 2 hours before the test. A laxative is medicine that loosens stool and increases bowel movements. An enema involves flushing water, laxative, or sometimes a mild soap solution into the anus using a special squirt bottle.  For the test, you will lie on a table while the doctor inserts a flexible tube into your anus. A small camera on the tube sends a video image of the intestinal lining to a computer screen. The doctor can see inflammation, ulcers, or bleeding. The doctor may also perform a biopsy. The doctor will look at the tissue with a microscope to confirm the diagnosis of Crohns disease. In most cases, youll be given a light sedative, and possibly pain medicine, to help you relax. You will not feel the biopsy.  Cramping or bloating may occur during the first hour after the test. Driving is not permitted for 24 hours after the test to allow the sedative time to wear off. Before the appointment, you should make plans for a ride home. By the next day, you should fully recover and go back to your normal diet.    - Flexible sigmoidoscopy. This test is used to look inside the rectum and lower colon. The health care provider will give you written bowel prep instructions to follow at home before the test. You may need to follow a clear liquid diet for 1 to 3 days before the test. You may also need a laxative or enema the night before the test. And youll have one or more enemas about 2 hours before the procedure.  For the test, you will lie on a table while the doctor inserts a flexible tube into your anus. You will not need a sedative for the test. A small camera on the tube sends a video image of the intestinal lining to a computer screen. The doctor can see inflammation, ulcers, or bleeding. The doctor may also perform a biopsy by snipping a bit of tissue from the intestinal lining. The doctor will look at the tissue with a microscope to confirm the diagnosis of Crohns disease. You will not feel the biopsy.  You can usually go back to your normal diet after the test, though you may have cramping or bloating during the first hour after the test.    - Computerized tomography (CT) scan. A CT scan uses x rays and computers to create images of the inside of the body. For the test, you will lie on a table that slides into a tunnel-shaped device where the x rays are taken. The technician may give you a solution to drink and an injection of a special dye through a needle inserted into an arm vein. You will not need a sedative for the test. CT scans can be used to help diagnose Crohn's disease.    - Upper GI series (x rays). An upper GI series may be done to look at the small intestine. No eating or drinking is allowed for 8 hours before the procedure. You will not need a sedative for the test. During the procedure, you will stand or sit in front of an x-ray machine and drink barium, a chalky liquid. The barium coats the small intestine, making signs of the disease show up more clearly on x rays. X-rays are then taken to get pictures of your small intestine. You may experience bloating during the test. After the test, you can resume regular activities and eat normally.    - Capsule endoscopy. Capsule endoscopy takes color photos of the inside of the digestive tract as a tiny wireless capsule passes through. The capsule is about the size of a vitamin pill. You swallow the capsule, and it moves through your digestive tract. As the capsule travels through your digestive tract, it sends signals to a recorder that you wear on your waist. After 12 hours, you will return the recorder to the doctor. The doctor will view the color photos of the inside of your digestive tract on a video monitor. The capsule is passed naturally in your stool without discomfort. You can continue your usual diet unless instructed otherwise by your doctor.    - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI is a noninvasive test that uses magnets and radio waves to produce detailed images of the digestive tract. No eating or drinking is required before the test. You will lie on a table that slides into a tunnel-shaped device where the images are taken. You will not need a sedative for the test. You may receive an injection of a special dye through a needle inserted into an arm vein. The dye helps the organs in your digestive tract show up more clearly during the test. You may hear loud knocking sounds when you are inside the MRI machine. You can breathe freely and communicate with medical staff through a two-way intercom system at any time during the test. After the test, you can resume regular activities and eat normally.\n\n\n\n    Medical Answer: To diagnose Crohn\u2019s disease, a doctor will perform a physical exam and tests. They will ask about your symptoms and medical history, and may order blood tests, a stool sample, and other tests such as colonoscopy, flexible sigmoidoscopy, CT scan, upper GI series, capsule endoscopy, and MRI. These tests can help identify inflammation, ulcers, or bleeding in the digestive tract, and confirm the diagnosis of Crohn\u2019s disease.",

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: What are the treatments for What I need to know about Crohn's Disease?\n\n    Reference Answer: Treatment for Crohns disease depends on\n                \n- where the disease is located in the GI tract  - what problems you already have from the disease  - what past treatments you have had for the disease\n                \nThe goals of treatment are to\n                \n- decrease the inflammation  - relieve symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, and rectal bleeding  - correct nutritional problems\n                \nTreatment may include\n                \n- medicines  - surgery  - eating, diet, and nutrition\n                \n\n                \nMedicines\n                \nOne or more of the following medicines may be used to treat Crohns disease:\n                \n- Anti-inflammation medicines may be used first to treat your Crohn's disease. These medicines help lower inflammation in the intestine and relieve the pain and diarrhea. Sometimes anti-inflammation medicines cause side effects, so you should talk with your health care provider about what to expect.  - Steroids also help lower inflammation. Steroids are similar to natural chemicals in the body. However, steroids are used only for a short time because long-term use can lead to serious side effects.  - Immune system suppressors. Azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine work by keeping your immune system from attacking harmless foreign substances. Immune system suppressors also cause side effects, so you should talk with your health care provider about what to expect.  - Biological therapies. Biological therapies are medicines that are given by an injection in the vein, infliximab (Remicade), or an injection in the skin, adalimumab (HUMIRA). Your health care provider may treat you with these medicines if others are not helping to decrease inflammation, or if you have fistulas with abscesses. The goals for using these medicines are to get you better, keep you better, and avoid long-term steroid use.  - Antibiotics. Antibiotics are used to treat bacterial overgrowth in the small intestine caused by stricture, fistulas, or surgery. For this common problem, the doctor may prescribe one or more of the following antibiotics: ampicillin, sulfonamide, cephalosporin, tetracycline, or metronidazole.\n                \n\n                \n- Anti-diarrheal medicines and fluid replacements. Diarrhea and abdominal cramps are often relieved when the inflammation improves, but more medicine may be needed. Anti-diarrheal medicines include diphenoxylate, loperamide, and codeine. People with diarrhea should drink plenty of fluids to prevent dehydrationloss of fluids from the body. If diarrhea does not improve, the person should see the doctor promptly for possible treatment with fluids given through a small tube inserted into an arm vein.\n                \nSurgery\n                \nSome people with Crohns disease need surgery if medicines are no longer working to control blockage, fistulas, abscesses, and bleeding. A surgeon performs the procedure in a hospital, where you will receive medicine to make you sleep during the surgery.\n                \nOne or more of the following surgeries may be needed:\n                \n- Intestinal resection. The surgeon removes the diseased section of intestine and puts the ends of the intestine back together.  - Proctocolectomy. Proctocolectomy is surgery to remove the rectum and part or all of the colon. An ileostomy is performed with a proctocolectomy.  - Ileostomy. Ileostomy is an operation to create an openingcalled a stomafor the stool to exit the body when the ends of the intestine cannot be put back together. To create a stoma, an end of the intestine is brought out through a small opening made on the lower right part of the abdomen near the beltline. The stoma is about the size of a quarter. An ostomy pouch is worn outside the body over the stoma to collect waste, and it is...\n\n    Generated Answer: Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease that can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract. While there is no cure for Crohn's disease, there are several treatment options available to manage symptoms, reduce inflammation, and maintain remission. Here are some common treatments:\n\n1. Medications: Various medications can be used to treat Crohn's disease, including anti-inflammatory drugs, immunosuppressants, biologic therapies, and antibiotics. The choice of medication depends on the severity and location of the inflammation.\n2. Diet and lifestyle modifications: Certain dietary changes and lifestyle modifications can help alleviate symptoms and reduce inflammation. These may include avoiding trigger foods, eating smaller, more frequent meals, increasing fiber intake, staying hydrated, and managing stress.\n3. Surgery: In severe cases of Crohn's disease, surgery may be necessary to remove damaged portions of the intestine or to treat complications such as obstructions, abscesses,...\n\n    Scoring guide:\n    1.

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: What are the symptoms of Wilson Disease?\n\n    Reference Answer: The signs and symptoms of Wilson disease vary, depending on what organs of the body are affected. Wilson disease is present at birth; however, the signs and symptoms of the disease do not appear until the copper builds up in the liver, the brain, or other organs.\n                \nWhen people have signs and symptoms, they usually affect the liver, the central nervous system, or both. The central nervous system includes the brain, the spinal cord, and nerves throughout the body. Sometimes a person does not have symptoms and a health care provider discovers the disease during a routine physical exam or blood test, or during an illness. Children can have Wilson disease for several years before any signs and symptoms occur. People with Wilson disease may have\n                \n- liver-related signs and symptoms  - central nervous system-related signs and symptoms  - mental health-related signs and symptoms  - other signs and symptoms\n                \nLiver-related Signs and Symptoms\n                \nPeople with Wilson disease may develop signs and symptoms of chronic, or long lasting, liver disease:\n                \n- weakness  - fatigue, or feeling tired  - loss of appetite  - nausea  - vomiting  - weight loss  - pain and bloating from fluid accumulating in the abdomen  - edemaswelling, usually in the legs, feet, or ankles and less often in the hands or face  - itching  - spiderlike blood vessels, called spider angiomas, near the surface of the skin  - muscle cramps  - jaundice, a condition that causes the skin and whites of the eyes to turn yellow\n                \nSome people with Wilson disease may not develop signs or symptoms of liver disease until they develop acute liver failurea condition that develops suddenly.\n                \nCentral Nervous System-related Signs and Symptoms\n                \nCentral nervous system-related symptoms usually appear in people after the liver has retained a lot of copper; however, signs and symptoms of liver disease may not be present. Central nervous system-related symptoms occur most often in adults and sometimes occur in children.1 Signs and symptoms include\n                \n- tremors or uncontrolled movements  - muscle stiffness  - problems with speech, swallowing, or physical coordination\n                \nA health care provider may refer people with these symptoms to a neurologista doctor who specializes in nervous system diseases.\n                \nMental Health-related Signs and Symptoms\n                \nSome people will have mental health-related signs and symptoms when copper builds up in the central nervous system. Signs and symptoms may include\n                \n- personality changes  - depression  - feeling anxious, or nervous, about most things  - psychosiswhen a person loses contact with reality\n                \nOther Signs and Symptoms\n                \nOther signs and symptoms of...\n\n    Generated Answer: Wilson's disease is a genetic disorder that affects the body's ability to metabolize copper. Symptoms can vary widely, but common ones include:\n\n1. Fatigue or lack of energy\n2. Jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes)\n3. Abdominal pain\n4. Fluid buildup in the abdomen (ascites)\n5.

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: How to diagnose Wilson Disease?\n\n    Reference Answer: A health care provider may use several tests and exams to diagnose Wilson disease, including the following:\n                \n- medical and family history  - physical exam  - blood tests  - urine tests  - liver biopsy  - imaging tests\n                \nHealth care providers typically see the same symptoms of Wilson disease in other conditions, and the symptoms of Wilson disease do not occur together often, making the disease difficult to diagnose.\n                \nMedical and Family History\n                \nA health care provider may take a medical and family history to help diagnose Wilson disease.\n                \nPhysical Exam\n                \nA physical exam may help diagnose Wilson disease. During a physical exam, a health care provider usually\n                \n- examines a patients body  - uses a stethoscope to listen to sounds related to the abdomen\n                \nA health care provider will use a special light called a slit lamp to look for Kayser-Fleischer rings in the eyes.\n                \nBlood Tests\n                \nA nurse or technician will draw blood samples at a health care providers office or a commercial facility and send the samples to a lab for analysis. A health care provider may\n                \n- perform liver enzyme or function testsblood tests that may indicate liver abnormalities.  - check copper levels in the blood. Since the copper is deposited into the organs and is not circulating in the blood, most people with Wilson disease have a lower-than-normal level of copper in the blood. In cases of acute liver failure caused by Wilson disease, the level of blood copper is often higher than normal.  - check the level of ceruloplasmina protein that carries copper in the bloodstream. Most people with Wilson disease have a lower-than-normal ceruloplasmin level.  - conduct genetic testing. A health care provider may recommend genetic testing in cases of a known family history of Wilson disease.\n                \nUrine Tests\n                \n24-hour urine collection. A patient will collect urine at home in a special container provided by a health care providers office or a commercial facility. A health care provider sends the sample to a lab for analysis. A 24-hour urine collection will show increased copper in the urine in most patients who have symptoms due to Wilson disease.\n                \nLiver Biopsy\n                \nA liver biopsy is a procedure that involves taking a small piece of liver tissue for examination with a microscope for signs of damage or disease. The health care provider may ask the patient to stop taking certain medications temporarily before the liver biopsy. He or she may also ask the patient to fasteat or drink nothingfor 8 hours before the procedure.\n                \nDuring the procedure, the patient lies on a table, right hand resting above the head. The health care provider applies a local anesthetic to the area where he or she will insert the biopsy needle. If needed, a health care provider will also give sedatives and pain medication. The health care provider uses the needle to take a small piece of liver tissue. He or she may use ultrasound, computerized tomography scans, or other imaging techniques to guide the needle. After the biopsy, the patient must lie on the right side for up to 2 hours and is monitored an additional 2 to 4 hours before being sent home.\n                \nA pathologista doctor who specializes in diagnosing diseasesexamines the liver tissue in a lab. The test can show cirrhosis of the liver. Sometimes the liver biopsy will show copper buildup in the liver cells; however, the results can vary because the copper does not always deposit evenly into the liver. Therefore, health care providers often find it more useful to analyze a piece of liver tissue for copper content. Most patients with Wilson disease have high levels of copper in the liver tissue when compared with carriers or with people who do not have Wilson disease.\n                \nMore information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Liver Biopsy.\n                \nImaging Tests\n                \nA health care provider may order imaging tests to evaluate brain abnormalities in patients who have nervous system symptoms often seen with Wilson disease, or in patients diagnosed with Wilson disease. Health care providers do not use brain imaging tests to diagnose Wilson disease, though certain findings may suggest the patient has the disease.\n                \nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI). An MRI is a test that takes pictures of the bodys internal organs and soft tissues without using x rays. A specially trained technician performs the procedure in an outpatient center or a hospital, and a radiologista doctor who specializes in medical imaginginterprets the images. The patient does not need anesthesia, though people with a fear of confined spaces may receive light sedation, taken by mouth. An MRI may include the injection of a special dye, called contrast medium. With most MRI machines, the patient will lie on a table that slides into a tunnel-shaped device that may be open ended or closed at one end. Some machines allow the patient to lie in a more open space. The technician will take a sequence of images from different angles to create a detailed picture of the brain. During sequencing, the patient will hear loud mechanical knocking and humming noises. The patient can wear earplugs to reduce the noise. The test takes about 30 minutes to an hour.\n                \nComputed tomography (CT) scan. A CT scan uses a combination of x rays and computer technology to produce cross-sectional images of the bodys internal organs and soft tissues. A specially trained technician performs the procedure in an outpatient center or a hospital, and a radiologist interprets the images. The patient does not need anesthesia. The patient will lie on a table that slides into a large, doughnut-shaped machine creating the images. The technician may inject a special dye, called contrast medium, into a vein in the arm to make the organs appear more clearly on the images produced by the CT scan. The test takes only a few minutes.\n                \nThe health care provider may order these tests to rule out other causes of the patients symptoms.",

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: What are the treatments for Wilson Disease?\n\n    Reference Answer: A health care provider will treat Wilson disease with a lifelong effort to reduce and control the amount of copper in the body. Treatment may include\n                \n- medications  - changes in eating, diet, and nutrition  - a liver transplant\n                \nMedications\n                \nA health care provider will prescribe medications to treat Wilson disease. The medications have different actions that health care providers use during different phases of the treatment.\n                \nChelating agents. Chelating agents are medications that remove extra copper from the body by releasing it from organs into the bloodstream. Once the cooper is in the bloodstream, the kidneys then filter the copper and pass it into the urine. A health care provider usually recommends chelating agents at the beginning of treatment. A potential side effect of chelating agents is that nervous system symptoms may become worse during treatment. The two medications available for this type of treatment include\n                \n- trientine (Syprine)the risk for side effects and worsening nervous system symptoms appears to be lower with trientine than d-penicillamine. Researchers are still studying the side effects; however, some health care providers prefer to prescribe trientine as the first treatment of choice because it appears to be safer.  - d-penicillaminepeople taking d-penicillamine may have other reactions or side effects, such as      - fever    - a rash    - kidney problems    - bone marrow problems\n                \nA health care provider will prescribe a lower dose of a chelating agent to women who are pregnant to reduce the risk of birth defects. A health care provider should consider future screening on any newborn whose parent has Wilson disease.\n                \nZinc. A health care provider will prescribe zinc for patients who do not have symptoms, or after a person has completed successful treatment using a chelating agent and symptoms begin to improve. Zinc, taken by mouth as zinc salts such as zinc acetate (Galzin), blocks the digestive tracts absorption of copper from food. Although most people taking zinc usually do not experience side effects, some people may experience stomach upset. A health care provider may prescribe zinc for children with Wilson disease who show no symptoms. Women may take the full dosage of zinc safely during pregnancy.\n                \nMaintenance, or long term, treatment begins when symptoms improve and tests show that copper is at a safe level. Maintenance treatment typically includes taking zinc or a lower dose of a chelating agent. A health care provider closely monitors the person and reviews regular blood and urine tests to...\n\n    Generated Answer: Wilson disease is a genetic disorder that affects copper metabolism. The main treatments for Wilson disease are:\n\n1. Medications: The most common medications used to treat Wilson disease are D-penicillamine and trientine, which help remove excess copper from the body. Zinc acetate is another medication that can be used to prevent the body from absorbing too much copper.\n2. Dietary modifications: Avoiding foods that are high in copper, such as shellfish, nuts, chocolate, and dried fruits, can help reduce copper intake.\n3. Regular...\n\n    Scoring guide:\n    1.

In this case, hyperthyroidism is due to too much TSH.\n                \nGraves Disease\n                \nGraves disease, also known as toxic diffuse goiter, is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism in the United States. Graves disease is an autoimmune disorder. Normally, the immune system protects the body from infection by identifying and destroying bacteria, viruses, and other potentially harmful foreign substances. But in autoimmune diseases, the immune system attacks the bodys own cells and organs.\n                \nWith Graves disease, the immune system makes an antibody called thyroid stimulating immunoglobulin (TSI) that attaches to thyroid cells. TSI mimics the action of TSH and stimulates the thyroid to make too much thyroid hormone.\n                \nMore information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Graves' disease.\n                \nThyroid Nodules\n                \nThyroid nodules, also called adenomas, are lumps in the thyroid. Thyroid nodules are common and usually noncancerous. About 3 to 7 percent of the U.S. population has them.2 However, nodules may become overactive and produce too much hormone.\n                \nA single overactive nodule is called a toxic adenoma. Multiple overactive nodules are called toxic multinodular goiter. Often found in older adults, toxic multinodular goiter can produce a large amount of excess thyroid hormone.\n                \nThyroiditis\n                \nThyroiditis is an inflammation of the thyroid that causes stored thyroid hormone to leak out of the thyroid gland. At first, the leakage raises hormone levels in the blood, leading to hyperthyroidism that lasts for 1 or 2 months. Most people then develop hypothyroidismwhen thyroid hormone levels are too lowbefore the thyroid is completely healed.\n                \nSeveral types of thyroiditis can cause hyperthyroidism followed by hypothyroidism:\n                \n- Subacute thyroiditis. This condition involves painful inflammation and enlargement of the thyroid. Experts are not sure what causes subacute thyroiditis, but it may be related to a viral or bacterial infection. The condition usually goes away on its own in a few months.  - Postpartum thyroiditis. This type of thyroiditis develops after a woman gives birth. For more information, see the section titled What happens with pregnancy and thyroid conditions?  - Silent thyroiditis. This type of thyroiditis is called silent because it is painless, as is postpartum thyroiditis, even though the thyroid may be enlarged. Like postpartum thyroiditis, silent thyroiditis is probably an autoimmune condition and sometimes develops into permanent hypothyroidism.\n                \nConsuming Too Much Iodine\n                \nThe thyroid uses iodine to make thyroid hormone, so the amount of iodine consumed influences the amount of thyroid hormone the thyroid makes. In some people, consuming large amounts of iodine may cause the thyroid to make excess thyroid hormone.\n                \nSometimes significant amounts of iodine are contained in medicationssuch as amiodarone, which is used to treat heart problemsor in supplements containing seaweed. Some cough syrups also contain large amounts of iodine. See Eating, Diet, and Nutrition for more information on iodine.\n                \nOvermedicating with Synthetic Thyroid Hormone\n                \nSome people who take synthetic thyroid hormone for hypothyroidism may take...\n\n    Generated Answer:...\n\n    Scoring guide:\n    1.

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: What are the treatments for Hyperthyroidism?\n\n    Reference Answer: Health care providers treat hyperthyroidism with medications, radioiodine therapy, or thyroid surgery. The aim of treatment is to bring thyroid hormone levels to a normal state, thus preventing long-term complications, and to relieve uncomfortable symptoms. No single treatment works for everyone.\n                \nTreatment depends on the cause of hyperthyroidism and how severe it is. When choosing a treatment, health care providers consider a patients age, possible allergies to or side effects of the medications, other conditions such as pregnancy or heart disease, and the availability of an experienced thyroid surgeon.\n                \nFinding the right specialist for treatment is an important first step. Some professional societies, listed under For More Information, and endocrinology departments in local teaching hospitals can provide the names of local specialists.\n                \nMedications\n                \nBeta blockers. Health care providers may prescribe a medication called a beta blocker to reduce symptoms until other treatments take effect. Beta blockers act quickly to relieve many of the symptoms of hyperthyroidism, such as tremors, rapid heartbeat, and nervousness, but do not stop thyroid hormone production. Most people feel better within hours of taking these medications.\n                \nAntithyroid medications. Antithyroid therapy is the easiest way to treat hyperthyroidism. Antithyroid medications interfere with thyroid hormone production but dont usually have permanent results. Antithyroid medications are not used to treat thyroiditis.\n                \nOnce treatment with antithyroid medications begins, thyroid hormone levels may not move into the normal range for several weeks or months. The average treatment time is about 1 to 2 years, but treatment can continue for many years.\n                \nAntithyroid medications can cause side effects in some people, including\n                \n- allergic reactions such as rashes and itching  - a decrease in the number of white blood cells in the body, which can lower resistance to infection  - liver failure, in rare cases\n                \nStop your antithyroid medication and call your health care provider right away if you develop any of the following while taking antithyroid medications:   - fatigue   - weakness   - vague abdominal pain   - loss of appetite   - skin rash or itching   - easy bruising   - yellowing of the skin or whites of the eyes, called jaundice   - persistent sore throat   - fever\n                \nIn the United States, health care providers prescribe the antithyroid medication methimazole (Tapazole, Northyx) for most types of hyperthyroidism.\n                \nAntithyroid medications and pregnancy. Because pregnant and breastfeeding women cannot receive radioiodine therapy, they are usually treated with an antithyroid medication instead. However, experts agree that women in their first trimester of pregnancy should not take methimazole due to the rare occurrence of damage to the fetus. Another antithyroid medication, propylthiouracil (PTU), is available for women in this stage of pregnancy or for women who are allergic to or intolerant of methimazole and have no other treatment options.\n                \nHealth care providers may prescribe PTU for the first trimester of pregnancy and switch to methimazole for the second and third trimesters. Some women are able to stop taking antithyroid medications in the last 4 to 8 weeks of pregnancy due to the remission of hyperthyroidism that occurs during pregnancy. However these women should continue to be monitored for recurrence of thyroid problems following delivery.\n                \nStudies have shown that mothers taking antithyroid medications may safely breastfeed. However, they should take only moderate doses, less than 1020 milligrams daily, of the antithyroid medication methimazole. Doses should be divided and taken after feedings, and the infants should be monitored for side effects.4\n                \nWomen requiring higher doses of the antithyroid medication to control hyperthyroidism should not breastfeed.\n                \nRadioiodine Therapy\n                \nRadioactive iodine-131 is a common and effective treatment for hyperthyroidism. In radioiodine therapy, patients take radioactive iodine-131 by mouth. Because the thyroid gland collects iodine to make thyroid hormone, it will collect the radioactive iodine from the bloodstream in the same way. The radioactive iodine gradually destroys the cells that make up the thyroid gland but does not affect other body tissues.\n                \nMore than one round of radioiodine therapy may be needed to bring thyroid hormone production into the normal range. In the meantime, treatment with beta blockers can control symptoms.\n                \nAlmost everyone who receives radioactive iodine treatment eventually develops hypothyroidism. But health care providers consider this an acceptable outcome because hypothyroidism is easier to treat and has fewer long-term complications than hyperthyroidism. People who develop hypothyroidism must take synthetic thyroid hormone.\n                \nRadioiodine and pregnancy. Although iodine-131 is not known to cause birth defects or infertility, health care providers advise women who are pregnant or breastfeeding against receiving radioiodine therapy. Women who are breastfeeding should wait at least 6 to 8 weeks after stopping breastfeeding before receiving radioiodine therapy.\n                \nThyroid Surgery\n                \nSurgery may be recommended for people with large goiters or nodules that are producing too much thyroid hormone. Surgery is also sometimes performed when cancer of the thyroid is suspected or confirmed. A surgeon removes part or all of the thyroid gland.\n                \nThe primary advantage of surgery is that it allows the surgeon to remove damaged areas of the thyroid gland and examine them for signs of cancer. Surgery may also be necessary when a goiter is so large that it makes swallowing difficult.\n                \nHowever, surgery carries risks, such as damage to nearby parathyroid glands\u2014four small glands located near the thyroid gland that play a role in regulating calcium levels in the blood. Damage to the recurrent laryngeal nerve is another risk; this nerve controls the vocal cords, so damage can lead to hoarseness or loss of the voice. Surgeons often use special techniques to preserve nerve function and take steps to prevent these complications.\n                \nAfter surgery, some people need to take synthetic thyroid hormone to replace the hormones produced by the removed thyroid tissue. If the entire thyroid gland was removed, lifelong replacement therapy will be required.\n                \nWhat are the benefits and drawbacks of each treatment option?\n                \nBenefits of beta blockers:\n                \n- Relieve symptoms quickly\n- Can be used in combination with other treatments\n                \nDrawbacks of beta blockers:\n                \n- Do not stop thyroid hormone production\n- May mask symptoms rather than treating the underlying condition\n                \nBenefits of antithyroid medications:\n                \n- Interfere with thyroid hormone production\n- Are relatively inexpensive\n                \nDrawbacks of antithyroid medications:\n                \n- May take several weeks or months to work\n- Can cause side effects such as allergic reactions, decreased white blood cell count, and liver failure\n                \nBenefits of radioiodine therapy:\n                \n- Is highly effective\n- Does not require ongoing treatment\n                \nDrawbacks of radioiodine therapy:\n                \n- May result in hypothyroidism\n- Is not suitable for pregnant or breastfeeding women\n                \nBenefits of thyroid surgery:\n                \n- Allows removal of damaged thyroid tissue\n- Can help diagnose cancer\n                \nDrawbacks of thyroid surgery:\n                \n- Carries risks such as damage to parathyroid glands and recurrent laryngeal nerve\n- May require lifelong replacement therapy\n\n    Model Answer: Medications, radioiodine therapy, or thyroid surgery are the",

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: What are the treatments for Diabetic Neuropathies: The Nerve Damage of Diabetes?\n\n    Reference Answer: The first treatment step is to bring blood glucose levels within the normal range to help prevent further nerve damage. Blood glucose monitoring, meal planning, physical activity, and diabetes medicines or insulin will help control blood glucose levels. Symptoms may get worse when blood glucose is first brought under control, but over time, maintaining lower blood glucose levels helps lessen symptoms. Good blood glucose control may also help prevent or delay the onset of further problems. As scientists learn more about the underlying causes of neuropathy, new treatments may become available to help slow, prevent, or even reverse nerve damage.\n                \nAs described in the following sections, additional treatment depends on the type of nerve problem and symptom.\n                \nPain Relief\n                \nDoctors usually treat painful diabetic neuropathy with oral medications, although other types of treatments may help some people. People with severe nerve pain may benefit from a combination of medications or treatments and should consider talking with a health care provider about treatment options.\n                \nMedications used to help relieve diabetic nerve pain include\n                \n- tricyclic antidepressants, such as amitriptyline, imipramine, and desipramine (Norpramin, Pertofrane)  - other types of antidepressants, such as duloxetine (Cymbalta), venlafaxine, bupropion (Wellbutrin), paroxetine (Paxil), and citalopram (Celexa)  - anticonvulsants, such as pregabalin (Lyrica), gabapentin (Gabarone, Neurontin), carbamazepine, and lamotrigine (Lamictal)  - opioids and opioidlike drugs, such as controlled-release oxycodone, an opioid; and tramadol (Ultram), an opioid that also acts as an antidepressant\n                \nDuloxetine and pregabalin are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration specifically for treating painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy.\n                \nPeople do not have to be depressed for an antidepressant to help relieve their nerve pain. All medications have side effects, and some are not recommended for use in older adults or those with heart disease. Because over-the-counter pain medicines such as acetaminophen and ibuprofen may not work well for treating most nerve pain and can have serious side effects, some experts recommend avoiding these medications.\n                \nTreatments that are applied to the skintypically to the feetinclude capsaicin cream and lidocaine patches (Lidoderm, Lidopain). Studies suggest that nitrate sprays or patches for the feet may relieve pain. Studies of alpha-lipoic acid, an antioxidant, and evening primrose oil suggest they may help relieve symptoms and improve nerve function in some patients.\n                \nA device called a bed cradle can keep sheets and blankets from touching sensitive feet and legs. Acupuncture, biofeedback, or physical therapy may help relieve pain in some people. Treatments that involve electrical nerve stimulation, magnetic therapy, and laser or light therapy may be helpful but need further study. Researchers are also studying several new therapies in clinical trials.\n                \nGastrointestinal Problems\n                \nTo relieve mild symptoms of gastroparesisindigestion, belching, nausea, or vomitingdoctors suggest eating small, frequent meals; avoiding fats; and eating less fiber. When symptoms are severe, doctors may prescribe erythromycin to speed digestion, metoclopramide to speed digestion and help relieve nausea, or other medications to help regulate digestion or reduce stomach acid secretion.\n                \nTo relieve diarrhea or other bowel problems, doctors may prescribe an antibiotic such as tetracycline, or other medications as appropriate.\n                \nDizziness and Weakness\n                \nSitting or standing slowly may help prevent the light-headedness, dizziness, or fainting associated with blood pressure and circulation problems. Raising the head of the bed or wearing elastic stockings may also help. Some people benefit from increased salt in the diet and treatment with salt-retaining hormones. Others benefit from high blood pressure medications. Physical therapy can help when muscle weakness or loss of coordination is a problem.\n                \nUrinary and Sexual Problems\n                \nTo clear up a urinary tract infection, the doctor will probably prescribe an antibiotic. Drinking plenty of fluids will help prevent another infection. People who have incontinence should try to urinate at regular intervalsevery 3 hours, for examplebecause they may not be able to tell when the bladder is full.\n                \nTo treat erectile dysfunction in men, the doctor will first do tests to rule out a hormonal cause. Several methods are available to treat erectile dysfunction caused by neuropathy. Medicines are available to help men have and maintain erections by increasing blood flow to the penis. Some are oral medications and others are injected into the penis or inserted into the urethra at the tip of the penis. Mechanical vacuum devices may also increase blood flow to the penis. Manually stimulated erection devices apply suction to the penis, causing it to swell, and a constriction band is then placed around the base of the penis to help maintain the erection.\n                \nFor women, the doctor may prescribe a low dose of estrogen cream directly applied to the vagina to help restore thinning vaginal tissues and improve lubrication. Devices that use suction to direct blood flow to the clitoris may help improve sexual arousal and orgasm.\n                \nOther Treatments\n                \nTranscutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) and percutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (PENS) are two techniques that involve applying a small electrical current to certain parts of the body. These currents can help block pain signals to the brain and stimulate nerves to release endorphins, also known as natural painkillers. Acupuncture is another technique that has been shown to reduce pain. Acupuncture involves the insertion of fine needles into the skin at specific locations on the body to stimulate nerves, muscles, and connective tissue. This can help improve functioning of affected areas.\n                \nIn addition, various alternative approaches such as meditation, biofeedback, cognitive-behavioral therapy, and relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, or guided imagery, may be helpful in managing chronic pain of diabetic neuropathy. Many people find these approaches helpful in coping with the emotional aspects of their condition.\n                \nSurgery may be considered to relieve compression on nerves, such as pressure caused by a tumor.\n                \nThe goals of research studies on diabetic neuropathy are to find treatments that can replace or repair damaged nerve cells and to make better diagnostic tools available.\n                \nThe National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) conducts and supports research to develop and test new treatments for people with diabetic neuropathy. Other components of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) that support research on diabetic neuropathy include the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), the National Institute on Aging (NIA), and the Office of Research on Women's Health (ORWH).\n                \nThe NIDDK also provides information to help people manage their symptoms and improve their quality of life through its Information Clearinghouse, which supplies information about diabetes to people with diabetes and to their families, health care providers, and the public. The NIDDK makes available free single copies of booklets and fact sheets about diabetes; subscriptions to its quarterly newsletter, Diabetes Dateline; and other materials.

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: How to diagnose Biliary Atresia?\n\n    Reference Answer: No single test can definitively diagnose biliary atresia, so a series of tests is needed. All infants who still have jaundice 2 to 3 weeks after birth, or who have gray or white stools after 2 weeks of birth, should be checked for liver damage.2\n                \nInfants with suspected liver damage are usually referred to a\n                \n- pediatric gastroenterologist, a doctor who specializes in childrens digestive diseases  - pediatric hepatologist, a doctor who specializes in childrens liver diseases  - pediatric surgeon, a doctor who specializes in operating on childrens livers and bile ducts\n                \nThe health care provider may order some or all of the following tests to diagnose biliary atresia and rule out other causes of liver problems. If biliary atresia is still suspected after testing, the next step is diagnostic surgery for confirmation.\n                \nBlood test. A blood test involves drawing blood at a health care providers office or commercial facility and sending the sample to a lab for analysis. High levels of bilirubin in the blood can indicate blocked bile ducts.\n                \nAbdominal x rays. An x ray is a picture created by using radiation and recorded on film or on a computer. The amount of radiation used is small. An x ray is performed at a hospital or outpatient center by an x-ray technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologista doctor who specializes in medical imaging. Anesthesia is not needed, but sedation may be used to keep infants still. The infant will lie on a table during the x ray. The x-ray machine is positioned over the abdominal area. Abdominal x rays are used to check for an enlarged liver and spleen.\n                \nUltrasound. Ultrasound uses a device, called a transducer, that bounces safe, painless sound waves off organs to create an image of their structure. The procedure is performed in a health care providers office, outpatient center, or hospital by a specially trained technician, and the images are interpreted a radiologist. Anesthesia is not needed, but sedation may be used to keep the infant still. The images can show whether the liver or bile ducts are enlarged and whether tumors or cysts are blocking the flow of bile. An ultrasound cannot be used to diagnose biliary atresia, but it does help rule out other common causes of jaundice.\n                \nLiver scans. Liver scans are special x rays that use chemicals to create an image of the liver and bile ducts. Liver scans are performed at a hospital or outpatient facility, usually by a nuclear medicine technician. The infant will usually receive general anesthesia or be sedated before the procedure. Hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid scanning, a type of liver scan, uses injected radioactive dye to trace the path of bile in the body. The test can show if and where bile flow is blocked. Blockage is likely to be caused by biliary atresia.\n                \nLiver biopsy. A biopsy is a procedure that involves taking a piece of liver tissue for examination with a microscope. The biopsy is performed by a health care provider in a hospital with light sedation and local anesthetic. The health care provider uses imaging techniques such as ultrasound or a computerized tomography scan to guide the biopsy needle into the liver. The liver tissue is examined in a lab by a pathologista doctor who specializes in diagnosing diseases. A liver biopsy can show whether biliary atresia is likely. A biopsy can also help rule out other liver problems, such as hepatitisan irritation of the liver...\n\n    Generated Answer: Biliary atresia is typically diagnosed through a series of tests and procedures, including:\n\n1. Physical exam: A healthcare provider will perform a physical exam, which may include checking for a visible abdominal mass or jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes).\n2. Blood tests: Blood tests can be used to measure liver function and check for the presence of bilirubin, a yellow pigment that can indicate a problem with the liver or bile ducts.\n3. Ultrasound: An ultrasound can be used to create images of the liver and bile ducts, which can help identify any blockages or abnormalities.\n4. HIDA scan: A HIDA scan is a nuclear medicine test that involves injecting a small amount of radioactive material into the body. This can help track the flow of bile through the bile ducts and identify any blockages.\n5. Liver biopsy: A liver biopsy...\n\n    Scoring guide:\n    1.

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: How to diagnose Mineral and Bone Disorder in Chronic Kidney Disease?\n\n    Reference Answer: A health care provider diagnoses mineral and bone disorder in CKD with\n                \n- a family and medical history  - a physical exam  - a blood test  - a bone biopsy  - an x-ray\n                \nFamily and Medical History\n                \nTaking a medical and family history is one of the first things a health care provider may do to help diagnose mineral and bone disorder in CKD. He or she will ask the patient or caretaker questions about when the patient was first diagnosed with CKD and whether any family members have also had mineral and bone disorder with or without CKD.\n                \nPhysical Exam\n                \nA physical exam may help diagnose mineral and bone disorder in CKD. During a physical exam, a health care provider usually examines a patients body for changes in bone structure.\n                \nBlood Test\n                \nA blood test involves drawing blood at a health care providers office or a commercial facility and sending the sample to a lab for analysis. The blood test shows levels of calcium, phosphorus, parathyroid hormone, and sometimes vitamin D.\n                \nBone Biopsy\n                \nA bone biopsy is a procedure that removes a piece of bone tissue for examination with a microscope. A health care provider performs the biopsy in a hospital with light sedation and local anesthetic. The health care provider uses imaging techniques such as ultrasound or a computerized tomography scan to guide the biopsy needle into the hip bone. A pathologista doctor who specializes in diagnosing diseasesexamines the bone tissue in a lab. The test can show whether a persons bone cells are building normal bone.\n                \nX-ray\n                \nAn x-ray is a picture created by using radiation and recorded on film or on a computer. The amount of radiation used is small. A radiographer performs the x-ray at a hospital or an outpatient center, and a radiologista doctor who specializes in medical imaginginterprets the images. Patients do not need anesthesia. The patient will lie on a table or stand during the x-ray. The...\n\n    Generated Answer: Mineral and Bone Disorder (MBD) in Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is typically diagnosed through a combination of laboratory tests, imaging studies, and clinical evaluation. Here are the steps to diagnose MBD in CKD:\n\n1. Medical history and physical exam: The doctor will take a detailed medical history and perform a physical exam to assess for symptoms of MBD, such as bone pain, muscle cramps, and weakness.\n2. Laboratory tests: The following lab tests are used to diagnose MBD:\n* Serum calcium, phosphorus, and intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) levels.\n* Alkaline phosphatase, a bone-specific isoenzyme, to assess bone turnover.\n* Vitamin D levels, as vitamin D deficiency can contribute to MBD.\n* Electrolytes, such as sodium, potassium, and bicarbonate, to assess for electrolyte imbalances.\n3. Imaging studies: Bone X-rays, bone scans, and...\n\n    Scoring guide:\n    1. Scientific Consensus: 1=Aligned, 0=No consensus, -1=Opposed\n    2.

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: What are the treatments for Mineral and Bone Disorder in Chronic Kidney Disease?\n\n    Reference Answer: Treating mineral and bone disorder in CKD includes preventing damage to bones by controlling parathyroid hormone levels through changes in eating, diet, and nutrition; medications and supplements; and dialysis. If these treatments do not bring parathyroid hormone levels under control, a health care provider may remove a persons parathyroid glands surgically, a procedure called a parathyroidectomy.\n                \nEating, Diet, and Nutrition\n                \nChanges in diet can treat mineral and bone disorder in CKD. Reducing dietary intake of phosphorus is one of the most important steps in preventing bone disease. Most foods contain phosphorus; however, processed and packaged foods contain especially high levels of phosphorus. Food producers use phosphorus as an additive to preserve the food on the shelf. People who have CKD or are on dialysis should avoid packaged foods containing ingredients that include the letters PHOS. A renal dietitian can help develop a dietary plan to control phosphorus levels in the blood. Some drinks and natural foods also contain high amounts of phosphorus, including\n                \n- beer  - cheese  - cocoa  - dark sodas  - dried beans  - milk  - nuts  - peanut butter  - peas\n                \nMore information is provided in the NIDDK health topics, How To Read a Food Label: Tips for People with Chronic Kidney Disease and Phosphorus: Tips for People with Chronic Kidney Disease.\n                \nMedications and Supplements\n                \nMedications protect the bones by restoring the proper balance of minerals and hormones. If the kidneys do not make adequate amounts of calcitriol, a health care provider may prescribe synthetic calcitriol as a pill (Rocaltrol) or, for dialysis patients, in an injectable form (Calcijex). Calcitriol helps reduce parathyroid hormone levels. Medications called doxercalciferol (Hectorol) and paricalcitol (Zemplar) act like calcitriol because they are also activated forms of vitamin D. A health care provider may prescribe a calcium supplement in addition to calcitriol or another activated form of vitamin D.\n                \nCertain forms of vitamin Davailable by prescription or as over-the-counter vitamin supplementsrequire activation by a persons kidneys before they can act as calcitriol does. However, the benefits of some of these not-yet-activated forms of vitamin Dfor example, ergocalciferol (Calciferol, Drisdol) or cholecalciferol (Delta D3)are unclear. To help ensure coordinated and safe care, people should discuss their use of alternative medications, including use of vitamin and mineral supplements, with their health care provider.\n                \nCinacalcet hydrochloride (Sensipar) belongs to another class of prescription medications called calcimimetics. Cinacalcet lowers parathyroid hormone levels by imitating calciums effects on the parathyroid gland. Generally, this medication is used only in people on dialysis.\n                \nOften, health care providers will prescribe medications called phosphate binderssuch as calcium carbonate (Tums), calcium acetate (PhosLo), sevelamer carbonate (Renvela), or lanthanum carbonate (Fosrenol)to take with meals and snacks to bind phosphorus in the bowel. These medications decrease the absorption of phosphorus into the blood.\n                \nDialysis\n                \nDialysis is the process of filtering wastes and extra fluid from the body by means other than the kidneys. The two forms of dialysis are hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis:\n                \n- Hemodialysis uses a machine to circulate a persons blood through a filter outside the body. The blood passes from a patients body through a needle, at nearly 1 pint per minute. The blood then travels through a tube that takes it to the filter, called a dialyzer. Inside the dialyzer, the blood flows through thin fibers that filter out wastes and extra fluid. After the machine filters the blood, it passes back to the body through another tube. More information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Treatment Methods for Kidney Failure: Hemodialysis.  - Peritoneal dialysis uses the lining of the abdomen to filter a persons blood inside the body. A soft tube called a catheter is placed in the patients abdomen a few weeks before peritoneal dialysis begins. A person uses the catheter to fill the empty space inside the abdomen with dialysis solutiona kind of salty waterfrom a plastic bag. While inside the body, the dialysis solution absorbs wastes and extra fluid. After a few hours, the person drains the used dialysis solution into another bag for disposal. The person then restarts the process with a fresh bag of dialysis solution. More information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Treatment Methods for Kidney Failure: Peritoneal Dialysis.\n                \nParathyroidectomy\n                \nIf other treatments do not bring parathyroid hormone levels under control, a surgeon may perform a parathyroidectomy. In this surgical procedure, the surgeon removes all four of a persons parathyroid glands. Removing the parathyroid glands stops the production of parathyroid hormone, which reduces phosphorus levels in the blood and prevents further bone damage. However, removing the parathyroid glands has risks, such as low calcium levels in the blood, so a health care provider must carefully weigh the potential benefits and risks before recommending surgery.\n                \nMore information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Parathyroidectomy.\n                \nHow can Mineral and Bone Disorder in Chronic Kidney Disease be prevented?\n                \nPreventing mineral and bone disorder in CKD involves managing the underlying causes of kidney disease and maintaining healthy lifestyle habits. More information is available in the NIDDK health topic, Preventing Chronic Kidney Disease.\n                \nWhat are the complications of Mineral and Bone Disorder in Chronic Kidney Disease?\n                \nMineral and bone disorder in CKD can lead to complications such as cardiovascular disease, bone pain, fractures, and increased risk of death. More information is available in the NIDDK health topic, Complications of Chronic Kidney Disease.\n                \nWhat are the symptoms of Mineral and Bone Disorder in Chronic Kidney Disease?\n                \nSymptoms of mineral and bone disorder in CKD may include bone pain, joint pain, muscle weakness, and difficulty walking. More information is available in the NIDDK health topic, Symptoms & Causes of Chronic Kidney Disease.\n                \nHow is Mineral and Bone Disorder in Chronic Kidney Disease diagnosed?\n                \nDiagnosing mineral and bone disorder in CKD involves blood tests to measure parathyroid hormone, calcium, phosphorus, and vitamin D levels. Imaging tests such as X-rays and bone density scans may also be used. More information is available in the NIDDK health topic, Diagnosing Chronic Kidney Disease.\n                \nHow common is Mineral and Bone Disorder in Chronic Kidney Disease?\n                \nMineral and bone disorder in CKD is a common complication of chronic kidney disease. More information is available in the NIDDK health topic, Statistics About Kidney Disease.\n                \nWhat research is being done on Mineral and Bone Disorder in Chronic Kidney Disease?\n                \nThe National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases conducts and supports research into many areas of kidney disease, including mineral and bone disorder in CKD.

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: How to diagnose Ectopic Kidney?\n\n    Reference Answer: A health care provider may use one or more of the following imaging tests to diagnose an ectopic kidney:\n                \n- Ultrasound. An ultrasound uses a device, called a transducer, that bounces safe, painless sound waves off organs to create an image of their structure. The procedure is performed in a health care providers office, outpatient center, or hospital by a specially trained technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologista doctor who specializes in medical imaging; anesthesia is not needed. The images can show the location of the kidneys.  - Intravenous pyelogram (IVP). An IVP is an x ray of the urinary tract. A special dye, called contrast medium, is injected into a vein in the persons arm, travels through the body to the kidneys, and makes urine visible on the x ray. The procedure is performed in a health care providers office, outpatient center, or hospital by an x-ray technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologist; anesthesia is not needed. An IVP can show a blockage in the urinary tract. In children, ultrasounds are usually done instead of IVPs.  - Voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG). A VCUG is an x-ray image of the bladder and urethra taken while the bladder is full and during urination, also called voiding. The bladder and urethra are filled with contrast medium to make the structures clearly visible on the x-ray images. The x-ray machine captures images of the contrast medium while the bladder is full and when the person urinates. The procedure is performed in a health care providers office, outpatient center, or hospital by an x-ray technician supervised by a radiologist, who then interprets the images. Anesthesia is not needed, but sedation may be used for some people. The test can show abnormalities of the inside of the urethra and bladder and whether urine is backing up toward the kidneys during urination.  - Radionuclide scan. A radionuclide scan is an imaging technique that relies on the detection of small amounts of radiation after injection of radioactive chemicals. Because the dose of the radioactive chemicals is small, the risk of causing damage to cells is low. Special cameras and computers are used to create images of the radioactive chemicals as they pass through the kidneys. The procedure is performed in a health care providers office, outpatient center, or hospital by a specially trained technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologist; anesthesia is not needed. This test can show the location of an ectopic kidney and whether the ureters are blocked.  - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI machines use radio waves and magnets to produce detailed pictures of the bodys internal organs and soft tissues without using x rays. An MRI may include the injection of contrast medium. With most MRI machines, the person lies on a table that slides into a tunnel-shaped device that may be open ended or closed at one end; some newer machines are designed to allow the person to lie in a more open space. The procedure is performed in an outpatient center or hospital by a specially trained...\n\n    Generated Answer: An ectopic kidney is a kidney that is located in an abnormal position, usually in the pelvis or lower abdomen. To diagnose an ectopic kidney, a healthcare provider will typically use imaging tests such as an ultrasound, CT scan, or MRI. These tests can help to visualize the location of the kidney and determine if it is functioning properly. In some cases, a...\n\n    Scoring guide:\n    1.

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: What to do for Kidney Failure: Choosing a Treatment That's Right for You?\n\n    Reference Answer: All of the treatment options for kidney failure require changes and restrictions in your diet.\n                \nHemodialysis\n                \nHemodialysis has the most restrictions. You should watch how much water and other liquids you get from food and drinks and avoid getting too much sodium, often from salt; potassium; and phosphorus. You may find it difficult to limit phosphorus because many foods that are high in phosphorus also provide the protein you need. Hemodialysis can remove protein from the body, so you should eat foods with high-quality protein, such as meat, fish, and eggs. Limit your phosphorus by avoiding foods such as beans, peas, nuts, tea, and colas. You may also need to take a pill called a phosphate binder that keeps phosphorus in your food from entering your bloodstream. Talk with your dialysis centers dietitian to find a hemodialysis meal plan that works for you.\n                \nMore information about nutrition for people who are on hemodialysis is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Eat Right to Feel Right on Hemodialysis.\n                \nPeritoneal Dialysis\n                \nLike hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis requires limits on sodium and phosphorus. You may need to take a phosphate binder. The liquid limitations in peritoneal dialysis may not be as strict as those for hemodialysis. In fact, you may need to drink more water and other liquids if your peritoneal dialysis treatments remove too much fluid from your body. Peritoneal dialysis removes potassium from the body, so you may need to eat potassium-rich foods such as potatoes, tomatoes, oranges, and bananas. However, be careful not to eat too much potassium because it can cause an unsteady heartbeat. Peritoneal dialysis removes even more protein than hemodialysis, so eating foods with high-quality protein is important. You may need to limit calories because your body absorbs sugar from the dialysis solution.\n                \nKidney Transplantation\n                \nKidney transplantation has the fewest restrictions on your diet. You should limit sodium because it can raise your blood pressure. Medicines that you take after the transplant can cause you to gain weight, so you may need to limit calories.\n                \nConservative Management\n                \nThe diet for conservative management limits protein. Protein breaks down into waste products the kidneys must remove. Limiting protein may reduce the amount of work the kidneys have to do so they will last longer.\n                \n\n                \nHemodialysis    Peritoneal Dialysis    Kidney Transplantation                 In Center                 Home                 CAPD                 CCPD                 Deceased                 Living                     Schedule                 Three treatments a week for 3 to 5 hours or more.                 More flexibility in determining your schedule of treatments.                 Four to six exchanges a day, every day.                 Three to five exchanges a night, every night, with an additional exchange begun first thing in the morning.                 You may wait several years before a suitable kidney is available.                 If a friend or family member is donating, you can schedule the operation when you're both ready.                     After the operation, you'll have regular checkups with your doctor.                     Location                 Dialysis center.                 Home.                 Any clean environment that allows solution exchanges.                 The transplant operation takes place in a hospital.                     Availability                 Available in most communities; may require travel in some rural areas.                 Generally available, but not widely used because of equipment requirements.                 Widely available.                 Widely available.                 Transplant centers are located throughout the country. However, the demand for kidneys is far greater than the supply.                     Equipment      and Supplies                 No equipment or supplies in the home.                 Hemodialysis machine connected to plumbing; chair.                 Bags of dialysis solution take up storage space.                 Cycling machine; bags of dialysis solution.                 No equipment or supplies needed.                     Training Required                 Little training required; clinic staff perform most tasks.                 You and a helper must attend several training sessions.                 You'll need to attend several training sessions.                 You'll need to learn about your medications and when to take them.

Level of Freedom                 Little freedom during treatments. Greater freedom on non-treatment days.                 More freedom to set your own schedule. You're still linked to a machine for several hours a week.                 You can move around, exercise, work, drive, etc., with solution in your abdomen.                 You're linked to a machine during the night. You're free from exchanges during the day.                 Offers the greatest amount of freedom.                     Level of Responsibility                 Some patients prefer to let clinic staff perform all tasks.                 You and your helper are responsible for cleaning and...\n\n    Generated Answer: I understand that you're looking for information about treating kidney failure. There are various treatment options available, including hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, kidney transplantation, and conservative management. Each option has its own set of dietary restrictions and lifestyle adjustments. For example, hemodialysis requires limiting fluids, sodium, potassium, and phosphorus, while peritoneal dialysis involves fewer dietary restrictions. Kidney transplantation offers the greatest amount of freedom, but it's essential to follow a healthy diet and take prescribed medications. Conservative management focuses on reducing protein intake to minimize the workload on the kidneys. It's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional to determine the best course of treatment for your specific situation. They can help you create a personalized plan that suits your needs and preferences.",

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: How to diagnose Pyelonephritis: Kidney Infection?\n\n    Reference Answer: The tests used to diagnose pyelonephritis depend on the patients age, gender, and response to treatment and include the following:\n                \n- Urinalysis. Urinalysis is testing of a urine sample. The urine sample is collected in a special container in a health care providers office or commercial facility and can be tested in the same location or sent to a lab for analysis. The presence of white blood cells and bacteria in the urine indicate infection.  - Urine culture. A urine culture is performed by placing part of a urine sample in a tube or dish with a substance that encourages any bacteria present to grow. The urine sample is collected in a special container in a health care providers office or commercial facility and sent to a lab for culture. Once the bacteria have multiplied, which usually takes 1 to 3 days, they can be identified. The health care provider can then determine the best treatment.  - Ultrasound. Ultrasound uses a device, called a transducer, that bounces safe, painless sound waves off organs to create an image of their structure. The procedure is performed in a health care providers office, outpatient center, or hospital by a specially trained technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologista doctor who specializes in medical imaging; anesthesia is not needed. The images can show obstructions in the urinary tract. Ultrasound is often used for people who do not respond to treatment within 72 hours.  - Computerized tomography (CT) scan. CT scans use a combination of x rays and computer technology to create three-dimensional (3-D) images. A CT scan may include the injection of a special dye, called contrast medium. CT scans require the person to lie on a table that slides into a tunnel-shaped device where the x rays are taken. The procedure is performed in an outpatient center or hospital by an x-ray technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologist. Anesthesia is not needed. CT scans can show obstructions in the urinary tract. The test is often used for people who do not respond to treatment within 72 hours.  - Voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG). A VCUG is an x-ray image of the bladder and urethra taken while the bladder is full and during urination, also called voiding. The procedure is performed in an outpatient center or hospital by an x-ray technician supervised by a radiologist, who then interprets the images. Anesthesia is not needed, but sedation may be used for some people. The bladder and urethra are filled with contrast medium to make the structures clearly visible on the x-ray images. The x-ray machine captures images of the contrast medium while the bladder is full and when the person urinates. This test can show abnormalities of the inside of the urethra and bladder and is usually used to detect VUR in children.  - Digital rectal examination (DRE). A DRE is a physical exam of the prostate that is performed in the health care providers office. Anesthesia is not needed. To perform the exam, the health care provider asks the person to bend over a table or lie on his side while holding his knees close to his chest. The health care provider slides a gloved, lubricated finger into the rectum and feels the part of the prostate that lies in front of the rectum. Men with suspected pyelonephritis may have a DRE to determine whether a swollen prostate may be obstructing the neck of the bladder.  - Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy. DMSA scintigraphy is an imaging technique that relies on the detection of small amounts of radiation after injection of radioactive material. Because the dose of radioactive material is small, the risk of causing damage to cells is low. The procedure is performed in an outpatient center or hospital by a specially trained technician, and the images are...\n\n    Generated Answer: Pyelonephritis, or kidney infection, is typically diagnosed by a healthcare professional based on a combination of symptoms, physical examination, and laboratory tests. Here are the steps to diagnose pyelonephritis:\n\n1. Medical history and symptoms: The doctor will ask about your symptoms, such as fever, chills, abdominal or back pain, nausea, or vomiting. They will also ask about any medical conditions you have, any medications you are taking, and any recent urinary tract infections.\n2. Physical examination: The doctor will perform a physical examination, including checking your temperature, blood pressure, and heart rate. They may also perform a pelvic or rectal examination to check for tenderness or masses.\n3. Urinalysis: A urinalysis is a test that examines a sample of your urine for signs of infection, such as white blood cells, red blood cells, and bacteria.\n4. Urine culture: A urine culture is a test that checks for the growth of bacteria in your urine. This test can help identify the type of bacteria causing the infection and guide antibiotic treatment.\n5. Imaging studies: Depending on the severity of your symptoms and the results of other tests, your doctor may order imaging studies, such as ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), to evaluate the kidneys and urinary tract for any blockages or abnormalities.\n6. Blood tests: Your doctor may also order blood tests to check for signs of infection, such as elevated white blood cell count, and to monitor kidney function.\n\nIt's essential to seek medical attention if you suspect you have pyelonephritis, as prompt treatment can help prevent complications and improve outcomes.",

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: What are the treatments for Autoimmune Hepatitis?\n\n    Reference Answer: Treatment for autoimmune hepatitis includes medication to suppress, or slow down, an overactive immune system. Treatment may also include a liver transplant.\n                \nTreatment works best when autoimmune hepatitis is diagnosed early. People with autoimmune hepatitis generally respond to standard treatment and the disease can be controlled in most cases. Long-term response to treatment can stop the disease from getting worse and may even reverse some damage to the liver.\n                \nMedications\n                \nPeople with autoimmune hepatitis who have no symptoms or a mild form of the disease may or may not need to take medication. A health care provider will determine if a person needs treatment. In some people with mild autoimmune hepatitis, the disease may go into remission. Remission is a period when a person is symptom-free and blood tests and liver biopsy show improvement in liver function.\n                \nCorticosteroids. Corticosteroids are medications that decrease swelling and reduce the activity of the immune system. Health care providers treat both types of autoimmune hepatitis with a daily dose of a corticosteroid called prednisone. Treatment may begin with a high dose that is gradually lowered as the disease is controlled. The treatment goal is to find the lowest possible dose that helps control the disease.\n                \nSide effects of prednisone may include\n                \n- weight gain  - weakness of the bones, called osteoporosis or osteomalacia  - thinning of the hair and skin  - acne  - diabetes  - high blood pressure  - cataracts, a clouding in the lens of the eyes  - glaucoma, elevated pressure in the eyes  - anxiety and confusion\n                \nA health care provider will closely monitor and manage any side effects that may occur, as high doses of prednisone are often prescribed to treat autoimmune hepatitis.\n                \nImmune system suppressors. Medications that suppress the immune system prevent the body from making autoantibodies and block the immune reaction that contributes to inflammation. In most cases, health care providers use azathioprine (Azasan, Imuran) in conjunction with prednisone to treat autoimmune hepatitis. When using azathioprine, a health care provider can use a lower dose of prednisone, which may reduce prednisone's side effects.\n                \nSide effects of azathioprine include\n                \n- low white blood cell count  - nausea  - vomiting  - skin rash  - liver damage  - pancreatitis, or inflammation of the pancreas\n                \nAzathioprine is an immune system suppressor, so people taking the medication should undergo routine blood tests to monitor their white blood cell counts. A low white blood cell count can lead to bone marrow failure. Bone marrow is the tissue found inside bones that produces new blood cells, including platelets. A health care provider will also check the platelet count when blood tests are done.\n                \nA person may need to discontinue prednisone or azathioprine if they cause severe side effects. The risk of side effects is higher in people who also have cirrhosis.\n                \nA health care provider may gradually reduce the dose of medication in people who show improvement, although the symptoms can return. When a person discontinues treatment, a health care provider will perform routine blood tests and carefully monitor the person's condition for a return of symptoms. Treatment with low doses of prednisone or azathioprine may be necessary on and off for many years.\n                \nPeople who do not respond to standard immune therapy or who have severe side effects from the medications may benefit from other immunosuppressive agents such as mycophenolate mofetil (CellCept), cyclosporine, or tacrolimus (Hecoria, Prograf).\n                \nMedications that suppress the immune system may lead to various forms of cancer. People on low doses of azathioprine for long periods of time are at slight risk of developing cancer.\n                \nLiver Transplant\n                \nIn some people, autoimmune hepatitis progresses to cirrhosis and end-stage liver failure, and a liver transplant may be necessary. Symptoms of cirrhosis and liver failure include the symptoms of autoimmune hepatitis and\n                \n- generalized itching  - a longer-than-usual amount of time for bleeding to stop  - easy bruising  - a swollen stomach or swollen ankles  - spiderlike blood vessels, called spider angiomas, that develop on the skin  - abdominal bloating due to an enlarged liver  - fluid in the abdomenalso called ascites  - forgetfulness or confusion\n                \nLiver transplant is surgery to remove a diseased or an injured liver and replace it with a healthy one from another person, called a donor. A team of surgeons performs a liver transplant in a hospital. When possible, the patient fasts for 8 hours before the...\n\n    Generated Answer: Autoimmune hepatitis is typically treated with medications that reduce inflammation and suppress the immune system's abnormal response. The most common treatments are:\n\n1. Corticosteroids, such as prednisone, which help reduce inflammation and swelling in the liver.\n2. Immunosuppressants, such as azathioprine, which help reduce the immune system's abnormal response and prevent further liver damage.\n\nIn some cases, a liver transplant may be necessary if the disease has progressed to cirrhosis or end-stage liver failure.",

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: What is (are) Diagnosis of Diabetes and Prediabetes?\n\n    Reference Answer: Diabetes is a complex group of diseases with a variety of causes. People with diabetes have high blood glucose, also called high blood sugar or hyperglycemia.\n                \nDiabetes is a disorder of metabolismthe way the body uses digested food for energy. The digestive tract breaks down carbohydratessugars and starches found in many foodsinto glucose, a form of sugar that enters the bloodstream. With the help of the hormone insulin, cells throughout the body absorb glucose and use it for energy. Insulin is made in the pancreas, an organ located behind the stomach. As the blood glucose level rises after a meal, the pancreas is triggered to release insulin. Within the pancreas, clusters of cells called islets contain beta cells, which make the insulin and release it into the blood.\n                \nDiabetes develops when the body doesnt make enough insulin or is not able to use insulin effectively, or both. As a result, glucose builds up in the blood instead of being absorbed by cells in the body. The bodys cells are then starved of energy despite high blood glucose levels.\n                \nOver time, high blood glucose damages nerves and blood vessels, leading to complications such as heart disease, stroke, kidney disease, blindness, dental disease, and amputations. Other complications of diabetes may include increased susceptibility to other diseases, loss of mobility with aging, depression, and pregnancy problems.\n                \nMain Types of Diabetes\n                \nThe three main types of diabetes are type 1, type 2, and gestational diabetes:\n                \n- Type 1 diabetes, formerly called juvenile diabetes, is usually first diagnosed in children, teenagers, and young adults. In this type of diabetes, the beta cells of the pancreas no longer make insulin because the bodys immune system has attacked and destroyed them.  - Type 2 diabetes, formerly called adult-onset diabetes, is the most common type of diabetes. About 90 to 95 percent of people with diabetes have type 2.1 People can develop type 2 diabetes at any age, even during childhood, but this type of diabetes is most often associated with older age. Type 2 diabetes is also associated with excess weight, physical inactivity, family history of diabetes, previous history of gestational diabetes, and certain ethnicities.   Type 2 diabetes usually begins with insulin resistance, a condition linked to excess weight in which muscle, liver, and fat cells do not use insulin properly. As a result, the body needs more insulin to help glucose enter cells to be used for energy. At first, the pancreas keeps up with the added demand by producing more insulin. But in time, the pancreas loses its ability to produce enough insulin in response to meals, and blood glucose levels rise.  - Gestational diabetes is a type of diabetes that develops only during pregnancy.  The hormones produced during pregnancy increase the amount of insulin needed to control blood glucose levels. If the body cant meet this increased need for insulin, women can develop gestational diabetes during the late stages of pregnancy.  Gestational diabetes usually goes away after the baby is born. Shortly after pregnancy, 5 to 10 percent of women with gestational diabetes continue to have high blood glucose levels and are diagnosed as having diabetes, usually type 2.1 Research has shown that lifestyle changes and the diabetes medication, metformin, can reduce or delay the risk of type 2 diabetes in these women. Babies born to mothers who had gestational diabetes are also more likely to develop obesity and type 2 diabetes as they grow up.  More information about gestational diabetes is provided in the NIDDK health topic, What I need to know about Gestational Diabetes,or by calling 18008608747.\n                \nOther Types of Diabetes\n                \nMany other types of diabetes exist, and a person can exhibit characteristics of more than one type. For example, in latent autoimmune diabetes in adults, people show signs of both type 1 and...\n\n    Generated Answer: Diabetes is diagnosed when a person's blood sugar level is too high. This can be determined through various tests, such as a fasting plasma glucose test, an oral glucose tolerance test, or a hemoglobin A1C test. Prediabetes is a condition in which blood sugar levels are higher than normal, but not high enough to be considered diabetes. It is often a precursor to type 2 diabetes and can be diagnosed through the same tests used to diagnose diabetes.\n\nHere are the specific criteria for diagnosing diabetes and prediabetes:\n\nDiabetes:\n\n* Fasting plasma glucose level of 126 mg/dL or higher on two separate occasions\n* Hemoglobin A1C level of 6.5% or higher\n* Random plasma glucose level of 200 mg/dL or higher, along with symptoms of diabetes (such as...\n\n    Scoring guide:\n    1.

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: How to diagnose Diagnosis of Diabetes and Prediabetes?\n\n    Reference Answer: Blood tests are used to diagnosis diabetes and prediabetes because early in the disease type 2 diabetes may have no symptoms. All diabetes blood tests involve drawing blood at a health care providers office or commercial facility and sending the sample to a lab for analysis. Lab analysis of blood is needed to ensure test results are accurate. Glucose measuring devices used in a health care providers office, such as finger-stick devices, are not accurate enough for diagnosis but may be used as a quick indicator of high blood glucose.\n                \nTesting enables health care providers to find and treat diabetes before complications occur and to find and treat prediabetes, which can delay or prevent type 2 diabetes from developing.\n                \nAny one of the following tests can be used for diagnosis:*\n                \n- an A1C test, also called the hemoglobin A1c, HbA1c, or glycohemoglobin test  - a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) test  - an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)\n                \n*Not all tests are recommended for diagnosing all types of diabetes. See the individual test descriptions for details.\n                \nAnother blood test, the random plasma glucose (RPG) test, is sometimes used to diagnose diabetes during a regular health checkup. If the RPG measures 200 milligrams per deciliter or above, and the individual also shows symptoms of diabetes, then a health care provider may diagnose diabetes.\n                \nSymptoms of diabetes include\n                \n- increased urination  - increased thirst  - unexplained weight loss\n                \nOther symptoms can include fatigue, blurred vision, increased hunger, and sores that do not heal.\n                \nAny test used to diagnose diabetes requires confirmation with a second measurement unless clear symptoms of diabetes exist.\n                \nThe following table provides the blood test levels for diagnosis of diabetes for nonpregnant adults and diagnosis of prediabetes.\n                \nA1C Test\n                \nThe A1C test is used to detect type 2 diabetes and prediabetes but is not recommended for diagnosis of type 1 diabetes or gestational diabetes. The A1C test is a blood test that reflects the average of a persons blood glucose levels over the past 3 months and does not show daily fluctuations. The A1C test is more convenient for patients than the traditional glucose tests because it does not require fasting and can be performed at any time of the day.\n                \nThe A1C test result is reported as a percentage. The higher the percentage, the higher a persons blood glucose levels have been. A normal A1C level is below 5.7 percent.\n                \nAn A1C of 5.7 to 6.4 percent indicates prediabetes. People diagnosed with prediabetes may be retested in 1 year. People with an A1C below 5.7 percent maystill be at risk for diabetes, depending on the presence of other characteristics that put them at risk, also known as risk factors. People with an A1C above 6.0 percent should be considered at very high risk of developing diabetes. A level of 6.5 percent or above means a person has diabetes.\n                \nLaboratory analysis. When the A1C test is used for diagnosis, the blood sample must be sent to a laboratory using a method that is certified by the NGSP to ensure the results are standardized. Blood samples analyzed in a health care providers office, known as point-of-care tests, are not standardized for diagnosing diabetes.\n                \nAbnormal results. The A1C test can be unreliable for diagnosing or monitoring diabetes in people with certain conditions known to interfere with the results. Interference should be suspected when A1C results seem very different from the results of a blood glucose test. People of African, Mediterranean, or Southeast Asian descent or people with family members with sickle cell anemia or a thalassemia are particularly at risk of interference.\n                \nHowever, not all of the A1C tests are unreliable for people with these diseases. The NGSP provides information about which A1C tests are appropriate to use for specific types of interference and details on any problems with the A1C test at www.ngsp.org.\n                \nFalse A1C test results may also occur in people with other problems that affect their blood or hemoglobin such as chronic kidney disease, liver disease, or anemia.\n                \nMore information about limitations of the A1C test and different forms of sickle cell anemia is provided in the NIDDK health topic, For People of African, Mediterranean, or Southeast Asian Heritage: Important Information about Diabetes Blood Tests, or by calling 18008608747.\n                \nChanges in Diagnostic Testing\n                \nIn the past, the A1C test was used to monitor blood glucose levels but not for diagnosis. The A1C test has now been standardized, and in 2009, an international expert committee recommended it be used for diagnosis of type 2 diabetes and prediabetes. In response to this recommendation, the American Diabetes Association, the European Association for the Study of Diabetes, and the International Diabetes Federation endorsed the use of the A1C test for diagnosis of type 2 diabetes and prediabetes.\n                \nFasting Plasma Glucose (FPG) Test\n                \nThe FPG test is used to measure blood glucose levels after an overnight fast of at least 8 hours. Results indicate\n                \n- Normal: Below 100 mg/dL\n                \n- Prediabetes: Between 100 and 125 mg/dL\n                \n- Diabetes: 126 mg/dL or above\n                \nOral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT)\n                \nThe OGTT is used to measure the bodys ability to regulate blood glucose levels after consuming a sugary drink containing a measured amount of glucose. This test can be used to diagnose pre-diabetes and diabetes. First, a healthcare provider will measure the individuals fasting glucose level. Then, the individual will consume the sugary drink and blood glucose measurements will be taken again after 1 hour and 2 hours. In healthy people, the body will produce insulin to help remove excess glucose from the bloodstream. In people with diabetes, the body either cant make enough insulin or cant effectively use the insulin it produces, leading to high blood sugar levels.\n                \nResults indicate\n                \n\n- Normal: Less than 140 mg/dL\n                \n- Prediabetes: Between 140 and 199 mg/dL\n                \n- Diabetes: 200 mg/dL or above\n                \nRandom Plasma Glucose (RPG) Test\n                \nThe RPG test measures blood glucose levels at any given time. It is often used to diagnose diabetes when symptoms are present. A healthcare provider may perform this test if someone is experiencing symptoms of diabetes, such as increased thirst and urination, unexplained weight loss, or cuts/bruises that are slow to heal. If the RPG measures 200 mg/dL or above, and the individual also shows symptoms of diabetes, then a healthcare provider may diagnose diabetes.\n                \nGestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) Screening\n                \nAll pregnant women between 24 and 28 weeks of pregnancy should be tested for GDM. Women who are overweight, have had a previous history of delivering large babies, or have a family history of diabetes may need to be tested earlier in their pregnancy. The screening typically involves drinking a sweet liquid and having blood drawn 1 hour later to measure glucose levels. If the results are abnormal, further testing will",

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: How to prevent Diagnosis of Diabetes and Prediabetes?\n\n    Reference Answer: A major research study, the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), proved that people with prediabetes were able to sharply reduce their risk of developing diabetes during the study by losing 5 to 7 percent of their body weight through dietary changes and increased physical activity.\n                \nStudy participants followed a low-fat, low-calorie diet and engaged in regular physical activity, such as walking briskly five times a week for 30 minutes. These strategies worked well for both men and women in all racial and ethnic groups, but were especially effective for participants age 60 and older. A follow-up study, the Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study (DPPOS), showed losing weight and being physically active provide lasting results. Ten years after the DPP, modest weight loss delayed onset of type 2 diabetes by an average of 4 years.\n                \nThe diabetes medication metformin also lowers the risk of type 2 diabetes in people with prediabetes, especially those who are younger and heavier and women who have had gestational diabetes. The DPPOS showed that metformin delayed type 2 diabetes by 2 years. People at high risk should ask their health care provider if they should take metformin to prevent type 2 diabetes. Metformin is a medication that makes insulin work better and can reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes.\n                \nMore information about insulin resistance, the DPP, or how to lower risk for type 2 diabetes is provided in the NIDDK health topics:\n                \n- Am I at Risk for Type 2 Diabetes?  - Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP)  - Insulin Resistance and Prediabetes\n                \nAdditional information about the DPP, funded under NIH clinical trial number NCT00004992, and the DPPOS,...\n\n    Generated Answer: Here are some ways to prevent a diagnosis of diabetes and prediabetes:\n\n1. Maintain a healthy weight: Being overweight is a major risk factor for developing diabetes. Even a small amount of weight loss can help prevent or delay diabetes.\n2. Exercise regularly: Regular physical activity can help you lose weight, lower your blood sugar levels, and boost your sensitivity to insulin.\n3. Eat a healthy diet: A healthy diet can help you maintain a healthy weight and keep your blood sugar levels stable. Focus on eating whole foods, such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats.\n4. Limit processed foods and sugary drinks: Processed foods and sugary drinks can increase your risk of developing diabetes. Try to limit your intake of these foods and drinks.\n5. Quit smoking: Smoking can increase your risk of...\n\n    Scoring guide:\n    1. Scientific Consensus: 1=Aligned, 0=No consensus, -1=Opposed\n    2.

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: What causes Hypothyroidism?\n\n    Reference Answer: Hypothyroidism has several causes, including\n                \n- Hashimotos disease  - thyroiditis, or inflammation of the thyroid  - congenital hypothyroidism, or hypothyroidism that is present at birth  - surgical removal of part or all of the thyroid  - radiation treatment of the thyroid  - some medications\n                \nLess commonly, hypothyroidism is caused by too much or too little iodine in the diet or by abnormalities of the pituitary gland.\n                \nHashimotos Disease\n                \nHashimotos disease, also called chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis, is the most common cause of hypothyroidism in the United States.1 Hashimotos disease is a form of chronic inflammation of the thyroid gland. Hashimotos disease is also an autoimmune disorder.\n                \nNormally, the immune system protects the body against foreign invaderssuch as viruses and bacteriathat can cause illness. But in autoimmune diseases, the immune system attacks the bodys own cells and organs. With Hashimotos disease, the immune system attacks the thyroid, causing inflammation and interfering with its ability to produce thyroid hormones.\n                \nMore information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Hashimotos Disease.\n                \nThyroiditis\n                \nThyroiditis causes stored thyroid hormone to leak out of the thyroid gland. At first, the leakage raises hormone levels in the blood, leading to hyperthyroidismwhen thyroid hormone levels are too highthat lasts for 1 or 2 months. Most people then develop hypothyroidism before the thyroid is completely healed.\n                \nSeveral types of thyroiditis can cause hyperthyroidism followed by hypothyroidism:\n                \n- Subacute thyroiditis. This condition involves painful inflammation and enlargement of the thyroid. Experts are not sure what causes subacute thyroiditis, but it may be related to a viral or bacterial infection. The condition usually goes away on its own in a few months.  - Postpartum thyroiditis. This type of thyroiditis develops after a woman gives birth. For more information, see the section titled What happens with pregnancy and thyroid conditions?  - Silent thyroiditis. This type of thyroiditis is called silent because it is painless, as is postpartum thyroiditis, even though the thyroid may be enlarged. Like postpartum thyroiditis, silent thyroiditis is probably an autoimmune condition and sometimes develops into permanent hypothyroidism.\n                \nCongenital Hypothyroidism\n                \nSome babies are born with a thyroid that is not fully developed or does not function properly. If untreated, congenital hypothyroidism can lead to mental retardation and growth failure. Early treatment can prevent these complications, so most newborns in the United States are screened for hypothyroidism.\n                \nSurgical Removal of the Thyroid\n                \nWhen part of the thyroid is removed, the remaining part may produce normal amounts of thyroid hormone, but some people who have this surgery develop hypothyroidism. Removal of the entire thyroid always results in hypothyroidism.\n                \nPart or all of the thyroid may be surgically removed as a treatment for\n                \n- hyperthyroidism  - a large goiter, which is an enlarged thyroid that may cause the neck to appear swollen and can interfere with normal breathing and swallowing  - thyroid nodules, which are noncancerous tumors, called adenomas, or lumps in the thyroid that can produce excess thyroid hormone  - thyroid cancer\n                \nRadiation Treatment of the Thyroid\n                \nRadioactive iodine, a common treatment for hyperthyroidism, gradually destroys the cells of the thyroid. Most people who receive radioactive iodine treatment...\n\n    Generated Answer: Hypothyroidism is a condition where the thyroid gland doesn't produce enough thyroid...\n\n    Scoring guide:\n    1.

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: What are the treatments for What I need to know about Living with Kidney Failure?\n\n    Reference Answer: Kidney failure means your kidneys no longer work well enough to do their job. You need treatment to replace the work your damaged kidneys have stopped doing. The treatments for kidney failure are\n                \n- hemodialysis  - peritoneal dialysis  - a kidney transplant\n                \nYour kidneys filter wastes and extra fluid from your blood to keep you healthy. The wastes and extra fluid become urine that is stored in your bladder until you urinate. When your kidneys fail, dialysis can take over a small part of the work your damaged kidneys can no longer do. You can make treatments work better by\n                \n- sticking to your treatment schedule  - taking all medicines your doctor prescribes  - following a special diet that keeps wastes from building up in your blood  - being active most days of the week\n                \nHemodialysis\n                \nHemodialysis is a treatment for kidney failure. Hemodialysis uses a machine to filter your blood outside your body. First, a dialysis nurse places two needles into your arm. A pump on the hemodialysis machine draws your blood through one of the needles into a tube. The tube takes the blood to a filter, called a dialyzer. Inside the dialyzer, your blood flows through thin fibers that are like straws. The wastes and extra fluid leave the blood through tiny holes in the fibers. Then, a different tube carries the filtered blood back to your body through the second needle.\n                \nMore information is provided in the NIDDK health topics, Treatment Methods for Kidney Failure: Hemodialysis and Home Hemodialysis.\n                \nPeritoneal Dialysis\n                \ncatheter\n                \nTreatment Methods for Kidney Failure: Peritoneal Dialysis\n                \nKidney Transplant\n                \nA kidney transplant places a healthy kidney from another person into your body. The kidney may come from someone who has just died. Your doctor will place your name on a waiting list for a kidney. A family member or friend might be able to give you a kidney. Then you dont have to wait.\n                \nThe new kidney takes over filtering your blood. The damaged kidneys usually stay where they are. The new kidney is placed in the...\n\n    Generated Answer: Living with kidney failure, also known as end-stage renal disease (ESRD), requires significant lifestyle changes and close medical management. Here are the three main treatment options:\n\n1. Dialysis: This is a process that removes waste and excess fluid from the blood when the kidneys can no longer do so. There are two main types: hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis.\n\n2. Kidney transplant: This involves surgically implanting a healthy kidney from a donor into the patient's body. After the transplant, the patient will need to take immunosuppressive drugs to prevent rejection of the new kidney.\n\n3....\n\n    Scoring guide:\n    1.

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: What to do for What I need to know about Living with Kidney Failure?\n\n    Reference Answer: Eating the right foods can help you feel better when you are on dialysis or have a kidney transplant. Staying healthy with kidney failure requires watching how much of these elements are included in your diet:\n                \n- Protein is in many foods you eat. Protein is in foods from animals and plants. Most diets include both types of protein. Protein provides the building blocks that maintain and repair muscles, organs, and other parts of the body. Too much protein can cause waste to build up in your blood, making your kidneys work harder. However, if you are on hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis, you need lots of protein to replace the protein that dialysis removes.  - Phosphorus is a mineral that keeps your bones healthy. Phosphorus also keeps blood vessels and muscles working. This mineral is found naturally in foods rich in protein, such as meat, poultry, fish, nuts, beans, and dairy products. Phosphorus is also added to many processed foods. You need phosphorus to turn food into energy; however, too much can cause your bones to weaken.  - Water is in drinks and in foods such as fruits, vegetables, ice cream, gelatin, soup, and popsicles. Your body needs water; however, too much can cause fluid to build up in your body and make your heart work harder.  - Sodium is a part of salt. You can find sodium in many canned, packaged, and fast foods and in seasonings and meats. You need sodium to help control the amount of fluid in your body; however, too much can cause high blood pressure.  - Potassium is a mineral that helps your nerves and muscles work the right way. Potassium is found in fruits and vegetables such as oranges, bananas, tomatoes, and potatoes. You need potassium for healthy nerves and brain cells; however, too much can make your heartbeat irregular.  - Calories are found in all foods and are especially high in oils and sugary foods. You need calories for energy; however, too many can cause weight gain and high blood sugar.\n                \nTalk with your clinics renal dietitian to find a meal plan that works for you.

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: What to do for Facing the Challenges of Chronic Kidney Disease in Children?\n\n    Reference Answer: For children with CKD, learning about nutrition is vital because their diet can affect how well their kidneys work. Parents or guardians should always consult with their childs health care team before making any dietary changes. Staying healthy with CKD requires paying close attention to the following elements of a diet:\n                \n- Protein. Children with CKD should eat enough protein for growth while limiting high protein intake. Too much protein can put an extra burden on the kidneys and cause kidney function to decline faster. Protein needs increase when a child is on dialysis because the dialysis process removes protein from the childs blood. The health care team recommends the amount of protein needed for the child. Foods with protein include      - eggs    - milk    - cheese    - chicken    - fish    - red meats    - beans    - yogurt    - cottage cheese    - Sodium. The amount of sodium children need depends on the stage of their kidney disease, their age, and sometimes other factors. The health care team may recommend limiting or adding sodium and salt to the diet. Foods high in sodium include      - canned foods    - some frozen foods    - most processed foods    - some snack foods, such as chips and crackers    - Potassium. Potassium levels need to stay in the normal range for children with CKD, because too little or too much potassium can cause heart and muscle problems. Children may need to stay away from some fruits and vegetables or reduce the number of servings and portion sizes to make sure they do not take in too much potassium. The health care team recommends the amount of potassium a child needs. Low-potassium fruits and vegetables include      - apples    - cranberries    - strawberries    - blueberries    - raspberries    - pineapple    - cabbage    - boiled cauliflower    - mustard greens    - uncooked broccoli   High-potassium fruits and vegetables include      - oranges    - melons    - apricots    - bananas    - potatoes    - tomatoes    - sweet potatoes    - cooked spinach    - cooked broccoli    - Phosphorus. Children with CKD need to control the level of phosphorus in their blood because too much phosphorus pulls calcium from the bones, making them weaker and more likely to break. Too much phosphorus also can cause itchy skin and red eyes. As CKD progresses, a child may need to take a phosphate binder with meals to lower the concentration of phosphorus in the blood. Phosphorus is found in high-protein foods. Foods with low levels of phosphorus include      - liquid nondairy creamer    - green beans    - popcorn    - unprocessed meats from a butcher    - lemon-lime soda    - root beer    - powdered iced tea and lemonade mixes    - rice and corn cereals    - egg...\n\n    Generated Answer: Managing chronic kidney disease (CKD) in children can be challenging, but with the right approach, it's possible to help them lead a healthy and fulfilling life. Here are some steps to take:\n\n1. Follow the treatment plan: It's essential to follow the treatment plan prescribed by your child's healthcare provider, which may include medication, dietary restrictions, and fluid intake limits.\n2. Encourage a healthy lifestyle: Encourage your child to engage in regular physical activity, get enough rest, and avoid smoking and alcohol.\n3. Monitor blood pressure: High blood pressure is a common complication of CKD, so it's crucial to monitor your child's blood pressure regularly.\n4. Manage anemia: Anemia is also common in children with CKD, so it's essential to manage it with the right medication and diet.\n5. Monitor growth and development: Children with CKD may experience growth and development delays, so it's crucial to monitor their progress...\n\n    Scoring guide:\n    1.

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: What are the treatments for What I need to know about Hepatitis B?\n\n    Reference Answer: Hepatitis B is not usually treated unless it becomes chronic. Chronic hepatitis B is treated with medicines that slow or stop the virus from damaging the liver.\n                \nMedicines for Chronic Hepatitis B\n                \nYour doctor will choose medicines or a combination of medicines that are likely to work for you. The doctor will closely watch your symptoms and schedule regular blood tests to make sure treatment is working.\n                \nMedicines given by shots include\n                \n- interferon  - peginterferon\n                \nMedicines taken by mouth include\n                \n- adefovir  - entecavir  - lamivudine  - telbivudine  - tenofovir\n                \nThe length of treatment varies. Talk with your doctor before taking other prescription medicines and over-the-counter medicines.\n                \nLiver Transplant\n                \nA liver transplant may be necessary if chronic hepatitis B causes severe liver damage that leads to liver failure. Symptoms of severe liver damage include the symptoms of hepatitis B and\n                \n- generalized itching  - a longer than usual amount of time for bleeding to stop  - easy bruising  - swollen stomach or ankles  - spiderlike blood vessels, called spider angiomas, that develop on the skin\n                \nLiver transplant is surgery to remove a diseased or injured liver and replace it with a healthy one from another person, called a donor. If your doctors tell you that you need a transplant, you should talk with them about the long-term demands of living with a liver transplant.\n                \nA team of surgeonsdoctors who specialize in surgeryperforms a liver transplant in a hospital. You will learn how to take care of yourself after you go home and about the medicines youll need to take to protect your new liver. Medicines taken after liver transplant surgery can prevent hepatitis B from coming back.\n              ...\n\n    Generated Answer: Hepatitis B is a liver infection caused by the Hepatitis B virus (HBV). The goal of treatment is to suppress the virus and prevent it from causing liver damage.\n\nThere are several treatment options available for Hepatitis B:\n\n1. Antiviral medications: These drugs can help to slow down or stop the virus from replicating, reducing the risk of liver damage. Examples include tenofovir, entecavir, and lamivudine.\n2. Interferon: This is a type of medication that can boost the body's immune system and help it to fight off the virus. However, it can have significant side effects and is usually only used in severe cases.\n3. Liver transplant: In rare cases, where the liver has been severely damaged, a liver transplant may be necessary.\n\nIt is important to note that not everyone with Hepatitis B will require treatment, as some...\n\n    Scoring guide:\n    1.

            "raw_response": "Evaluate this medical answer based on the criteria below. Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: What are the symptoms of Alagille Syndrome?\n\n    Reference Answer: The signs and symptoms of Alagille syndrome and their severity vary, even among people in the same family sharing the same gene mutation.\n                \nLiver\n                \nIn some people, problems in the liver may be the first signs and symptoms of the disorder. These signs and symptoms can occur in children and adults with Alagille syndrome, and in infants as early as the first 3 months of life.\n                \nJaundice. Jaundicewhen the skin and whites of the eyes turn yellowis a result of the liver not removing bilirubin from the blood. Bilirubin is a reddish-yellow substance formed when hemoglobin breaks down. Hemoglobin is an iron-rich protein that gives blood its red color. Bilirubin is absorbed by the liver, processed, and released into bile. Blockage of the bile ducts forces bilirubin and other elements of bile to build up in the blood.\n                \nJaundice may be difficult for parents and even health care providers to detect. Many healthy newborns have mild jaundice during the first 1 to 2 weeks of life due to an immature liver. This normal type of jaundice disappears by the second or third week of life, whereas the jaundice of Alagille syndrome deepens. Newborns with jaundice after 2 weeks of life should be seen by a health care provider to check for a possible liver problem.\n                \nDark urine and gray or white stools. High levels of bilirubin in the blood that pass into the urine can make the urine darker, while stool lightens from a lack of bilirubin reaching the intestines. Gray or white bowel movements after 2 weeks of age are a reliable sign of a liver problem and should prompt a visit to a health care provider.\n                \nPruritus. The buildup of bilirubin in the blood may cause itching, also called pruritus. Pruritus usually starts after 3 months of age and can be severe.\n                \nXanthomas. Xanthomas are fatty deposits that appear as yellow bumps on the skin. They are caused by abnormally high cholesterol levels in the blood, common in people with liver disease. Xanthomas may appear anywhere on the body. However, xanthomas are usually found on the elbows, joints, tendons, knees, hands, feet, or buttocks.\n                \nOther Signs and Symptoms of Alagille Syndrome\n                \nCertain signs of Alagille syndrome are unique to the disorder, including those that affect the vertebrae and facial features.\n                \nFace. Many children with Alagille syndrome have deep-set eyes, a straight nose, a small and pointed chin, large ears, and a prominent, wide forehead. These features are not usually recognized until after infancy. By adulthood, the chin is more prominent.\n                \nEyes. Posterior embryotoxon is a condition in which an opaque ring is present in the cornea, the transparent covering of the eyeball. The abnormality is common in people with Alagille syndrome, though it usually does not affect vision.\n                \nSkeleton. The most common skeletal defect in a person with Alagille syndrome is when the shape of the vertebraebones of the spinegives the appearance of flying butterflies. This defect, known as \"butterfly\" vertebrae, rarely causes medical problems or requires treatment.\n                \nHeart and blood vessels. People with Alagille syndrome may have the following signs and symptoms having to do with the heart and blood vessels:\n                \n- heart murmuran extra or unusual sound heard during a heartbeat. A heart murmur is the most common sign of Alagille syndrome other than the general symptoms of liver disease.1 Most people with Alagille syndrome have a narrowing of the blood vessels that carry blood from the heart to the lungs.1 This narrowing causes a murmur that can be heard with a stethoscope. Heart murmurs usually do not cause problems.  - heart walls and valve problems. A small number of people with Alagille syndrome have serious problems with the walls or valves of the heart. These conditions may need treatment with medications or corrective surgery.  - blood vessel problems. People with Alagille syndrome may have abnormalities of the blood vessels in the head and neck....\n\n    Generated Answer: Alagille Syndrome is a genetic disorder that can affect multiple body systems, but it primarily impacts the liver and heart. The symptoms can vary widely, but common signs include:\n\n1. Liver problems: This can include a lack of bile ducts in the liver (biliary atresia), leading to jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes), liver scarring (cirrhosis), and liver failure.\n\n2. Heart conditions: This can include structural heart defects, such as pulmonary artery stenosis (narrowing of the blood vessel that carries blood from the heart to the lungs).\n\n3. Eye issues: Some individuals might experience eye problems like posterior embryotoxon, where there's an opaque ring in the cornea.\n\n4. Skeletal anomalies: Butterfly vertebrae, where the vertebrae resemble butterfly wings, is a characteristic feature.\n\n5. Facial characteristics: Deep-set eyes, a straight nose, a small and pointed chin, large ears, and a prominent forehead are typical facial features.\n\n6. Other potential complications: These can include kidney disease, pancreatitis, growth hormone deficiency, and certain types of cancer.\n\nThe severity and combination of these symptoms can vary significantly between affected individuals, even within the same family.",

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: What are the complications of Alagille Syndrome?\n\n    Reference Answer: The complications of Alagille syndrome include liver failure, portal hypertension, and growth problems. People with Alagille syndrome usually have a combination of complications, and may not have every complication listed below.\n                \nLiver failure. Over time, the decreased number of bile ducts may lead to chronic liver failure, also called end-stage liver disease. This condition progresses over months, years, or even decades. The liver can no longer perform important functions or effectively replace damaged cells. A person may need a liver transplant. A liver transplant is surgery to remove a diseased or an injured liver and replace it with a healthy whole liver or a segment of a liver from another person, called a donor.\n                \nPortal hypertension. The spleen is the organ that cleans blood and makes white blood cells. White blood cells attack bacteria and other foreign cells. Blood flow from the spleen drains directly into the liver. When a person with Alagille syndrome has advanced liver disease, the blood flow backs up into the spleen and other blood vessels. This condition is called portal hypertension. The spleen may become larger in the later stages of liver disease. A person with an enlarged spleen should avoid contact sports to protect the organ from injury. Advanced portal hypertension can lead to serious bleeding problems.\n                \nGrowth problems. Alagille syndrome can lead to poor growth in infants and children, as well as delayed puberty in older children. Liver disease can cause malabsorption, which can result in growth problems. Malabsorption is the inability of the small intestine to absorb nutrients from foods, which results in protein, calorie, and vitamin deficiencies. Serious heart problems, if present in Alagille syndrome, can also affect growth.\n                \nMalabsorption. People with Alagille syndrome may have diarrhealoose, watery stoolsdue to malabsorption. The condition occurs because bile is necessary for the digestion of food. Malabsorption can lead to bone fractures, eye problems, blood-clotting problems, and learning delays.\n                \nLong-term Outlook\n                \nThe long-term outlook for people with Alagille syndrome depends on several factors, including the severity of...\n\n    Generated Answer: Alagille Syndrome is a genetic disorder that can affect multiple body systems, including the liver, heart, and digestive system. Some potential complications of this condition include:\n\n* Liver problems: Many people with Alagille Syndrome have liver damage or bile duct blockages, which can lead to scarring of the liver (cirrhosis) and liver failure.\n* Heart problems: Alagille Syndrome can also affect the heart, causing narrowing of the aortic valve (valve that regulates blood flow from the heart to the rest of the body) or other heart defects.\n* Digestive problems: Alagille Syndrome can cause problems with the digestive system, such as poor absorption of nutrients (malabsorption), leading to vitamin deficiencies and difficulty gaining weight.\n* Growth problems: Children with Alagille Syndrome may be smaller than average and may have delays in reaching developmental milestones.\n* Kidney problems: Some people with Alagille Syndrome have kidney problems, such as kidney cysts or kidney stones.\n* Bone...\n\n    Scoring guide:\n    1.

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: How to diagnose Alagille Syndrome?\n\n    Reference Answer: A health care provider diagnoses Alagille syndrome by performing a thorough physical exam and ordering one or more of the following tests and exams:\n                \n- blood test  - urinalysis  - x ray  - abdominal ultrasound  - cardiology exam  - slit-lamp exam  - liver biopsy  - genetic testing\n                \nAlagille syndrome can be difficult to diagnose because the signs and symptoms vary and the syndrome is so rare.\n                \nFor a diagnosis of Alagille syndrome, three of the following symptoms typically should be present:\n                \n- liver symptoms, such as jaundice, pruritus, malabsorption, and xanthomas  - heart abnormalities or murmurs  - skeletal abnormalities  - posterior embryotoxon  - facial features typical of Alagille syndrome  - kidney disease  - blood vessel problems\n                \nA health care provider may perform a liver biopsy to diagnose Alagille syndrome; however, it is not necessary to make a diagnosis. A diagnosis can be made in a person who does not meet the clinical criteria of Alagille syndrome yet does have a gene mutation of JAG1. The health care provider may have a blood sample tested to look for the JAG1 gene mutation. The gene mutation can be identified in 94 percent of people with a diagnosis of Alagille syndrome.2\n                \nBlood test. A blood test involves drawing blood at a health care provider's office or a commercial facility and sending the sample to a lab for analysis. The blood test can show nutritional status and the presence of liver disease and kidney function.\n                \nUrinalysis. Urinalysis is the testing of a urine sample. The urine sample is collected in a special container in a health care provider's office or a commercial facility and can be tested in the same location or sent to a lab for analysis. Urinalysis can show many problems of the urinary tract and other body systems. The sample may be observed for color, cloudiness, or concentration; signs of drug use; chemical composition, including glucose; the presence of protein, blood cells, or bacteria; or other signs of disease.\n                \nX ray. An x ray is a picture created by using radiation and recorded on film or on a computer. The amount of radiation used is small. An x-ray technician performs the x ray at a hospital or an outpatient center, and a radiologista doctor who specializes in medical imaginginterprets the images. Anesthesia is not needed. The patient will lie on a table or stand during the x ray. The technician positions the x-ray machine over the spine area to look for \"butterfly\" vertebrae. The patient will hold his or her breath as the picture is taken so that the picture will not be blurry. The patient may be asked to change position for additional pictures.\n                \nAbdominal ultrasound. Ultrasound uses a device, called a transducer, that bounces safe, painless sound waves off organs to create an image of their structure. The transducer can be moved to different angles to make it possible to examine different organs. In abdominal ultrasound, the health care provider applies a gel to the patient's abdomen and moves a handheld transducer over the skin. The gel allows the transducer to glide easily, and it improves the transmission of the signals. A specially trained technician performs the procedure in a health care provider's office, an outpatient center, or a hospital, and a radiologist interprets the images; anesthesia is not needed. The images can show an enlarged liver or rule out other conditions.\n                \nCardiology exam. A cardiologista doctor who treats people who have heart problemsperforms a cardiology exam in a health care provider's office, an outpatient center, or a hospital. During a full exam, a cardiologist may inspect the patient's physical appearance, measure pulse rate and blood pressure, observe the jugular vein, check for rapid or skipped heartbeats, listen for variations in heart sounds, and listen to the lungs.\n                \nSlit-lamp exam. An ophthalmologista doctor who diagnoses and treats all eye diseases and eye disordersperforms a slit-lamp exam to diagnose posterior embryotoxon. The ophthalmologist examines the eye with a slit lamp, a microscope combined with a high-intensity light that shines a thin beam on the eye. While sitting in a chair, the patient will rest his or her head on the slit lamp. A yellow dye may be used to examine the cornea and tear layer. The dye is applied as a drop, or the specialist may touch a strip of paper stained with the dye to the white of the patient's eye. The specialist will also use drops in the patient's eye to dilate the pupil.\n                \nLiver biopsy. A liver biopsy is a procedure that involves taking a piece of liver tissue for examination with a microscope for signs of damage or disease. The health care provider may ask the patient to stop taking certain medications temporarily before the procedure. The patient may be sedated and should plan to stay in bed after the procedure. The patient may feel some discomfort after the procedure, and should avoid heavy lifting for several days. Liver biopsy is performed by a gastroenterologista doctor who specializes in digestive system disordersor a hepatologista doctor who specializes in liver diseasesin a hospital with fluoroscopy and ultrasound machines available. A specially trained nurse assists with about 30 minutes for the procedure. The patient lies on his or her back on an examining table. The health care provider cleans and numbs the skin on the upper right side of the abdomen with a local anesthetic. The health care provider then makes a tiny incision in the skin, inserts the biopsy needle into the liver, and removes the needle with the tissue sample. Generally, the patient does not need stitches to close the incision. The patient is monitored in the hospital for up to two hours after the procedure.\n                \nGenetic testing. Genetic testing involves analyzing DNA to look for a suspected genetic disorder. Genetic testing is usually performed on a sample of the patient's blood. The sample is sent to a laboratory where technicians look for signs of a genetic mutation. Results are usually ready in several weeks or months.\n                \nThe health care provider may recommend follow-up testing, additional testing, or specialty care if Alagille syndrome is diagnosed.",

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: What are the treatments for Alagille Syndrome?\n\n    Reference Answer: Treatment for Alagille syndrome includes medications and therapies that increase the flow of bile from the liver, promote growth and development in infants' and children's bodies, correct nutritional deficiencies, and reduce the person's discomfort. Ursodiol (Actigall, Urso) is a medication that increases bile flow. Other treatments address specific symptoms of the disorder.\n                \nLiver failure. People with Alagille syndrome who develop end-stage liver failure need a liver transplant with a whole liver from a deceased donor or a segment of a liver from a living donor. People with Alagille syndrome who also have heart problems may not be candidates for a transplant because they could be more likely to have complications during and after the procedure. A liver transplant surgical team performs the transplant in a hospital.\n                \nMore information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Liver Transplantation.\n                \nPruritus. Itching may decrease when the flow of bile from the liver is increased. Medications such as cholestyramine (Prevalite), rifampin (Rifadin, Rimactane), naltrexone (Vivitrol), or antihistamines may be prescribed to relieve pruritus. People should hydrate their skin with moisturizers and keep their fingernails trimmed to prevent skin damage from scratching. People with Alagille syndrome should avoid baths and take short showers to prevent the skin from drying out.\n                \nIf severe pruritus does not improve with medication, a procedure called partial external biliary diversion may provide relief from itching. The procedure involves surgery to connect one end of the small intestine to the gallbladder and the other end to an opening in the abdomencalled a stomathrough which bile leaves the body and is collected in a pouch. A surgeon performs partial external biliary diversion in a hospital. The patient will need general anesthesia.\n                \nMalabsorption and growth problems. Infants with Alagille syndrome are given a special formula that helps the small intestine absorb much-needed fat. Infants, children, and adults can benefit from a high-calorie diet, calcium, and vitamins A, D, E, and K. They may also need additional zinc. If someone with Alagille syndrome does not tolerate oral doses of vitamins, a health care provider may give the person injections for a period of time. A child may receive additional calories through a tiny tube that is passed through the nose into the stomach. If extra calories are needed for a long time, a health care provider may...\n\n    Generated Answer: Alagille Syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects multiple body systems, including the liver, heart, and digestive system. Treatment for Alagille Syndrome typically involves managing the symptoms and complications of the disease, as there is no cure.\n\nFor liver-related symptoms, such as jaundice, itching, and liver scarring (cirrhosis), treatment may include:\n\n1. Medications to relieve itching and reduce bile buildup in the body.\n2. Nutritional support, such as a high-calorie diet, vitamin supplements, and medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) oil to help with fat absorption.\n3. Endoscopic procedures to place stents or balloons in the bile ducts to improve bile flow.\n4. In severe cases, a liver transplant may be necessary.\n\nFor heart-related symptoms, such as heart murmurs and high blood pressure in the lungs (pulmonary hypertension), treatment may include:\n\n1. Medications to lower blood pressure and improve heart function.\n2. Surgery to repair or replace heart valves.\n3....\n\n    Scoring guide:\n    1.

Taking Steps to Lower Your Risk of Getting Diabetes?\n\n    Reference Answer: Yes. The results of the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) proved that weight loss through moderate diet changes and physical activity can delay or prevent type 2 diabetes. The DPP was a federally funded study of 3,234 people at high risk for diabetes. This study showed that a 5-to 7-percent weight loss, which for a 200-pound person would be 10 to 14 pounds, slowed development of type 2 diabetes.\n                \nPeople at High Risk for Diabetes\n                \nDPP study participants were overweight and had higher than normal levels of blood glucose, a condition called prediabetes. Many had family members with type 2 diabetes. Prediabetes, obesity, and a family history of diabetes are strong risk factors for type 2 diabetes. About half of the DPP participants were from minority groups with high rates of diabetes, including African Americans, Alaska Natives, American Indians, Asian Americans, Hispanics/Latinos, and Pacific Islander Americans.\n                \nDPP participants also included others at high risk for developing type 2 diabetes, such as women with a history of gestational diabetes and people age 60 and older.\n                \nApproaches to Preventing Diabetes\n                \nThe DPP tested three approaches to preventing diabetes:\n                \n- Making lifestyle changes. People in the lifestyle change group exercised, usually by walking 5 days a week for about 30 minutes a day, and lowered their intake of fat and calories.  - Taking the diabetes medicine metformin. Those who took metformin also received information about physical activity and diet.  - Receiving education about diabetes. The third group only received information about physical activity and diet and took a placeboa pill without medicine in it.\n                \nPeople in the lifestyle change group showed the best outcomes. But people who took metformin also benefited. The results showed that by losing an average of 15 pounds in the first year of the study, people in the lifestyle change group reduced their risk of developing type 2 diabetes by 58 percent over 3 years. Lifestyle change was even more effective in those age 60 and older. People in this group reduced their risk by 71 percent. But people in the metformin group also benefited, reducing their risk by 31 percent. More information about the DPP, funded under National Institutes of Health (NIH) clinical trial number NCT00004992, is available at www.bsc.gwu.edu/dpp.\n                \nLasting Results\n                \nThe Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study (DPPOS) has shown that the benefits of weight loss and metformin last for at least 10 years. The DPPOS has continued to follow most DPP participants since the DPP ended in 2001. The DPPOS showed that 10 years after enrolling in the DPP,\n                \n- people in the lifestyle change group reduced their risk for developing diabetes by 34 percent  - those in the lifestyle change group age 60 or older had even greater benefit, reducing their risk of developing diabetes by 49 percent  - participants in the lifestyle change group also had fewer heart and blood vessel disease risk factors, including lower blood pressure and triglyceride levels, even though they took fewer medicines to control their heart disease risk  - the metformin group reduced the risk of developing diabetes by 18 percent\n                \nEven though controlling your weight with lifestyle changes is challenging, it produces long-term health rewards by lowering your risk for type 2 diabetes, lowering your blood glucose levels, and reducing other heart disease risk factors. More information about the DPPOS, funded under NIH clinical trial number NCT00038727, can be found at www.bsc.gwu.edu/dpp.\n                \n\n                \nOther Types of Diabetes   In addition to type 2, the other main types of diabetes are type 1 diabetes and gestational diabetes.  Type 1 Diabetes   Type 1 diabetes, formerly called juvenile diabetes, is usually first diagnosed in children, teenagers, and young adults. In this type of diabetes, your pancreas can no longer make insulin because your bodys immune system has attacked and destroyed the cells that make it. Treatment for type 1 diabetes includes taking insulin shots or using an insulin pump, making wise food choices, being physically active on a regular basis, controlling blood pressure and cholesterol, and, for some, taking aspirin daily.  Gestational Diabetes   Gestational diabetes is a type of diabetes that develops only during pregnancy. Hormones produced by your placenta and other pregnancy-related factors contribute to insulin resistance, which occurs in all women during late pregnancy. Insulin resistance increases the amount of insulin needed to control blood glucose levels. If your pancreas cant produce enough insulin, gestational diabetes occurs.   As with type 2 diabetes, excess weight is linked to gestational diabetes. Overweight or obese women are at particularly high risk for developing gestational diabetes. Women who have had gestational diabetes before are at increased risk of developing it again in future pregnancies. Other risk factors include delivering a baby weighing more than 9 pounds, having polycystic ovary syndrome, having a family history of diabetes, and being age 35 or older.  LADA   LADA stands for latent autoimmune diabetes in adults. It shares characteristics of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Like type 1 diabetes, LADA is an autoimmune process in which your body gradually loses its ability to make insulin. However, like type 2 diabetes, LADA tends to appear in adults and progresses slowly. LADA patients often seek help when they notice symptoms of neuropathy, which is nerve damage caused by poor blood sugar control.  Maturity-Onset Diabetes of the Young (MODY)   MODY is a rare form of diabetes different from both type 1 and type 2. MODY is caused by genetic defects of the pancreatic beta-cell function, leading to impaired early insulin secretion.  Secondary Diabetes   Secondary diabetes is a form of diabetes that is similar to type 1 diabetes but is caused by certain medications or diseases that damage the pancreas.  Monogenic Diabetes   Monogenic diabetes is a rare form of diabetes caused by mutations in a single gene. These genes carry the instructions for chemical reactions that lead to proper insulin production.  Cystic Fibrosis-Related Diabetes (CFRD)   CFRD is a unique form of diabetes that occurs in some people with cystic fibrosis. It shares characteristics of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes.  Steroid-Induced Diabetes   Steroid-induced diabetes is a form of diabetes that occurs in some people who take steroids for asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, or lupus. Steroids can raise blood glucose levels by increasing insulin resistance and impairing insulin secretion.  Pancreatitis-Related Diabetes   Pancreatitis-related diabetes is a form of diabetes that occurs in some people who have chronic pancreatitis. Chronic pancreatitis is inflammation of the pancreas that does not heal and that alters its normal structure and functions.  Hemochromatosis-Related Diabetes   Hemochromatosis-related diabetes is a form of diabetes that occurs in some people who have hereditary hemochromatosis. Hereditary hemochromatosis is a genetic disorder causing the body to absorb too much iron from the gut, leading to iron overload. Excess iron stores can damage many organs, including",

Taking Steps to Lower Your Risk of Getting Diabetes?\n\n    Reference Answer: Your eating, diet, and nutrition choices play an important role in preventing or delaying diabetes. Follow the suggestions below to reach and maintain a reasonable weight and make wise food choices most of the time. Remember that it can take time to change your habits and be patient with yourself. You can also get help from a dietitian or join a weight-loss program to support you while you reach your goals.\n                \n\n                \nReach and Maintain a Reasonable Body Weight\n                \nYour weight affects your health in many ways. Being overweight can keep your body from making and using insulin properly. Excess body weight can also cause high blood pressure. Every pound you lose lowers your risk of getting diabetes.\n                \nIn addition to weight, the location of excess fat on the body can be important. A waist measurement of 40 inches or more for men and 35 inches or more for women is linked to insulin resistance and increases a persons risk for type 2 diabetes. This is true even if your BMI falls within the normal range.\n                \n\n                \nFind Your BMI\n                \nThe BMI is a measure of body weight relative to height. The BMI can help you find out whether you are normal weight, overweight, or obese. Use the table on pages 24 and 25 to find your BMI.\n                \n- Find your height in the left-hand column.  - Move across in the same row to the number closest to your weight.  - The number at the top of that column is your BMI. Check the word above your BMI to see whether you are normal weight, overweight, or obese.\n                \nThe BMI has certain limitations. The BMI may overestimate body fat in athletes and others who have a muscular build and underestimate body fat in older adults and others who have lost muscle.\n                \nThe BMI for children and teens must be determined based on age, height, weight, and sex. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has...\n\n    Generated Answer: To determine if you are at risk for type 2 diabetes, you can assess your lifestyle and family history. Risk factors include:\n\n1. Being overweight or obese\n2. Having a family history of diabetes\n3. Having high blood pressure or high cholesterol\n4. Having gestational diabetes or giving birth to a baby weighing over 9 pounds\n5. Being physically inactive\n6. Belonging to certain ethnic groups (including African Americans, Hispanic/Latino Americans, and Native Americans)\n\nTo lower your risk of getting type 2 diabetes, consider taking the following steps:\n\n1. Maintain a healthy weight by balancing caloric intake with physical activity.\n2. Engage in regular physical activity, such as brisk walking, for at least 30 minutes, five days a...\n\n    Scoring guide:\n    1. Scientific Consensus: 1=Aligned, 0=No consensus, -1=Opposed\n    2.

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: What are the treatments for What I need to know about Interstitial Cystitis/Painful Bladder Syndrome?\n\n    Reference Answer: No one treatment for IC/PBS has been found that works for everyone. Your doctor or nurse will work with you to find a treatment plan that meets your special needs. The plan may include diet and lifestyle changes, bladder retraining, activity and exercise, physical therapy, and various types of medicines. You should expect some treatment failures along the way, but, with time, you and your doctor or nurse should find a treatment that gives you some relief and helps you cope with your disease.\n                \nDiet and Lifestyle Changes\n                \nSome people with IC/PBS find that certain foods or drinks bring on their symptoms. Others find no link between symptoms and what they eat.\n                \nLearning what foods cause symptoms for you may require some trial and error. Keep a food diary and note the times you have bladder pain. The diary might reveal that your flare-ups always happen, for example, after you eat tomatoes or oranges.\n                \nSome doctors recommend taking an antacid medicine with meals. The medicine reduces the amount of acid that gets into the urine.\n                \nIf you make changes to your diet, remember to eat a variety of healthy foods.\n                \nBladder Retraining\n                \nBladder retraining is a way to help your bladder hold more urine. People with bladder pain often get in the habit of using the bathroom as soon as they feel pain or urgency. They then feel the need to go before the bladder is really full. The body may get used to frequent voiding. Bladder retraining helps your bladder hold more urine before signaling the urge to urinate.\n                \nKeep a bladder diary to track how you are doing. Start by noting the times when you void. Note how much time goes by between voids. For example, you may find that you return to the bathroom every 40 minutes.\n                \nTry to stretch out the time between voids. If you usually void every 40 minutes, try to wait at least 50 minutes before you go to the bathroom.\n                \nIf your bladder becomes painful, you may use the bathroom. But you may find that your first urge to use the bathroom goes away if you ignore it. Find ways to relax or distract yourself when the first urge strikes.\n                \nAfter a few days, you may be able to stretch the time out to 60 or 70 minutes, and you may find that the urge to urinate does not return as soon.\n                \nActivity\n                \nIf you have IC/PBS, you may feel the last thing you want to do is exercise. But many people feel that easy activities like walking or gentle stretching exercises help relieve symptoms.\n                \nPhysical Therapy\n                \nYour doctor or nurse may suggest pelvic exercises. The pelvic muscles hold the bladder in place and help control urination. The first step is to find the right muscle to squeeze. A doctor, nurse, or physical therapist can help you. One way to find the muscles is to imagine that you are trying to stop passing gas. Squeeze the muscles you would use. If you sense a \"pulling\" feeling, you have found the right muscles for pelvic exercises.\n                \nYou may need exercises to strengthen those muscles so that it's easier to hold in urine. Or you may need to learn to relax your pelvic muscles if tense muscles are part of your bladder pain.\n                \nSome physical therapists specialize in helping people with pelvic pain. Ask your doctor or nurse to help you find a professional trained in pelvic floor physical therapy.\n                \nReducing Stress\n                \nStress doesn't cause IC/PBS. But stress can trigger painful flare-ups in someone who has IC/PBS. Learning to reduce stress in your life by making time for relaxation every day may help control some symptoms of IC/PBS.\n                \nOral Medicines\n                \nPain pills like aspirin, ibuprofen, or acetominophen can help control mild bladder pain. Advil and Motrin are examples of ibuprofen. Tylenol is an example of acetominophen. Talk with your doctor if you feel you need a stronger pain medicine.\n                \nYour doctor may recommend a medication, pentosan polysulfate sodium, sold as Elmiron, which is approved for treating the pain of IC/PBS. You may need to take this medicine for up to 6 months before you notice improvement. Elmiron does not work for everyone, but some people with IC/PBS have found relief taking it. You need a doctor's order for Elmiron. If you don't notice improvement of your symptoms in 6 months, this medicine is not likely to work.\n                \nResearchers are also looking at other kinds of medicines. Medicines that treat heartburn might help bladder symptoms by reducing the amount of acid made in the body. Muscle relaxants can keep the bladder from squeezing at the wrong time. Keeping the bladder muscle relaxed helps ease the symptoms of IC/PBS.\n                \nBladder Stretching\n                \nThe doctor uses a cystoscope to look inside the bladder. Then the doctor fills the bladder with water through the scope. This stretches the bladder wall. Some people report relief from this procedure. It may need to be repeated.\n                \nOther Treatments\n                \nSome people with IC/PBS have tried alternative therapies such as acupuncture, herbal supplements, and biofeedback. These methods have not been scientifically proven to help IC/PBS. However, some people report relief from these methods.\n                \nSurgery\n                \nIn rare cases, surgery may be recommended to relieve severe pain or pressure in the bladder. Surgery may involve removing scar tissue or ulcers in the bladder, or cutting away inflamed areas of the bladder. In some cases, the surgeon may remove the bladder entirely. Removing the bladder requires creating a new way for urine to leave the body. This is called urinary diversion.\n                \nUrinary Diversion\n                \nUrinary diversion involves creating a hole in the abdomen (called a stoma) where urine comes out instead of coming out through the urethra. The urine collects in a bag attached to the outside of the body. Urinary diversion is considered only in very severe cases of IC/PBS.\n                \nTranscutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS)\n                \nTENS is a small device that sends electrical impulses to the nerves in the lower back. TENS has been shown to relieve pain in some people with IC/PBS.\n                \nCyclosporine A\n                \nCyclosporine A is a drug that suppresses the immune system. Researchers are studying whether cyclosporine A can help people with IC/PBS by suppressing the immune system's attack on the bladder.\n                \nBotox\n                \nBotulinum toxin type A, commonly known as Botox, is a drug made from the same bacteria that causes botulism. Botox temporarily paralyzes the muscle into which it is injected. Researchers are studying whether injecting Botox into the bladder muscle can help relieve the symptoms of IC/PBS.\n                \nDimethyl Sulfoxide (DMSO)\n                \nDMSO is a liquid inserted directly into the bladder through a catheter. DMSO has anti-inflammatory properties and has been shown to provide relief for some people with IC/PBS.\n                \nLidocaine\n                \nLidocaine is a local anesthetic that numbs the area where it is applied. Lidocaine has been shown to provide relief for some people with IC/PBS.\n                \nResiniferatoxin\n                \nResiniferatoxin",

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: How to diagnose Prostate Enlargement: Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia?\n\n    Reference Answer: A health care provider diagnoses benign prostatic hyperplasia based on\n                \n- a personal and family medical history  - a physical exam  - medical tests\n                \nPersonal and Family Medical History\n                \nTaking a personal and family medical history is one of the first things a health care provider may do to help diagnose benign prostatic hyperplasia. A health care provider may ask a man\n                \n- what symptoms are present  - when the symptoms began and how often they occur  - whether he has a history of recurrent UTIs  - what medications he takes, both prescription and over the counter  - how much liquid he typically drinks each day  - whether he consumes caffeine and alcohol  - about his general medical history, including any significant illnesses or surgeries\n                \nPhysical Exam\n                \nA physical exam may help diagnose benign prostatic hyperplasia. During a physical exam, a health care provider most often\n                \n- examines a patients body, which can include checking for      - discharge from the urethra    - enlarged or tender lymph nodes in the groin    - a swollen or tender scrotum    - taps on specific areas of the patients body  - performs a digital rectal exam\n                \nA digital rectal exam, or rectal exam, is a physical exam of the prostate. To perform the exam, the health care provider asks the man to bend over a table or lie on his side while holding his knees close to his chest. The health care provider slides a gloved, lubricated finger into the rectum and feels the part of the prostate that lies next to the rectum. The man may feel slight, brief discomfort during the rectal exam. A health care provider most often performs a rectal exam during an office visit, and men do not require anesthesia. The exam helps the health care provider see if the prostate is enlarged or tender or has any abnormalities that require more testing.\n                \nMany health care providers perform a rectal exam as part of a routine physical exam for men age 40 or older, whether or not they have urinary problems.\n                \nMedical Tests\n                \nA health care provider may refer men to a urologista doctor who specializes in urinary problems and the male reproductive systemthough the health care provider most often diagnoses benign prostatic hyperplasia on the basis of symptoms and a digital rectal exam. A urologist uses medical tests to help diagnose lower urinary tract problems related to benign prostatic hyperplasia and recommend treatment. Medical tests may include\n                \n- urinalysis  - a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood test  - urodynamic tests  - cystoscopy  - transrectal ultrasound  - biopsy\n                \nUrinalysis. Urinalysis involves testing a urine sample. The patient collects a urine sample in a special container in a health care providers office or a commercial facility. A health care provider tests the sample during an office visit or sends it to a lab for analysis. For the test, a nurse or technician places a strip of chemically treated paper, called a dipstick, into the urine. Patches on the dipstick change color to indicate signs of infection in urine.\n                \nPSA blood test. A health care provider may draw blood for a PSA test during an office visit or in a commercial facility and send the sample to a lab for analysis. Prostate cells create a protein called PSA. Men who have prostate cancer may have a higher amount of PSA in their blood. However, a high PSA level does not necessarily indicate prostate cancer. In fact, benign prostatic hyperplasia, prostate infections, inflammation, aging, and normal fluctuations often cause high PSA levels. Much remains unknown about how to interpret a PSA blood test, the tests ability to discriminate between cancer and prostate conditions such as benign prostatic hyperplasia, and the best course of action to take if the PSA level is high.\n                \nUrodynamic tests. Urodynamic tests include a variety of procedures that look at how well the bladder and urethra store and release urine. A health care provider performs urodynamic tests during an office visit or in an outpatient center or a hospital. Some urodynamic tests do not require anesthesia; others may require local anesthesia. Most urodynamic tests focus on the bladders ability to hold urine and empty steadily and completely and may include the following:\n                \n- uroflowmetry, which measures how rapidly the bladder releases urine  - postvoid residual measurement, which evaluates how much urine remains in the bladder after urination  - reduced urine flow or residual urine in the bladder, which often suggests urine blockage due to benign prostatic hyperplasia\n                \nMore information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Urodynamic Testing.\n                \nCystoscopy. Cystoscopy is a procedure that uses a tubelike instrument, called a cystoscope, to look inside the urethra and bladder. A urologist inserts the cystoscope through the opening of the urethra and slowly advances it into the bladder. A lighted lens on the cystoscope allows the urologist to see the lining of these organs and check for\n                \n- narrowing, blockages, or stones in the urethra  - tumors, ulcers, bleeding, or other abnormalities in the bladder\n                \nThe urologist may use cystoscopy to remove tissue samples or kidney stones from the bladder. The urologist may apply a local anesthetic spray, gel, or injection to numb the area before inserting the cystoscope. However, some people may need sedation and pain relief medication to reduce any discomfort during the procedure.\n                \nTransrectal ultrasound. Transrectal ultrasound uses a device inserted into the rectum to bounce sound waves off internal organs and tissues. The reflected sound waves create images of the prostate gland. A radiologist interprets the images and reports results to the urologist. The procedure is performed in a doctors office, an outpatient center, or a hospital by a specially trained technician. Anesthesia is not needed, but a man may experience mild discomfort during the procedure.\n                \nBiopsy. A biopsy is a procedure that involves taking a small piece of tissue from the prostate gland for examination with a microscope. A pathologist examines the tissue sample in a lab and looks for abnormal cell changes. A urologist may perform a biopsy in an office or an outpatient surgical setting. The urologist will give a local anesthetic to numb the area and may offer additional sedation to make the patient comfortable during the procedure. The urologist then inserts the biopsy needle into the rectum and advances it into the prostate gland. The urologist may use imaging techniques such as ultrasound or MRI to guide the placement of the biopsy needle. The entire procedure usually takes about 10 minutes and is generally painless. However, some people may experience pelvic discomfort or rectal pressure following the biopsy, which typically goes away within a few days.\n                \nTo confirm the diagnosis of benign prostatic hyperplasia, the urologist may perform a biopsy to rule out prostate cancer. If the biopsy indicates cancer, the urologist refers the patient to an oncologista doctor who specializes in treating cancersfor further evaluation and treatment.\n                \nIn summary, diagnosing benign prostatic hyperplasia requires a combination of\n                \n- a personal and family medical history  - a physical exam  - medical tests\n                \nA",

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: What are the treatments for Prostate Enlargement: Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia?\n\n    Reference Answer: Treatment options for benign prostatic hyperplasia may include\n                \n- lifestyle changes  - medications  - minimally invasive procedures  - surgery\n                \nA health care provider treats benign prostatic hyperplasia based on the severity of symptoms, how much the symptoms affect a mans daily life, and a mans preferences.\n                \nMen may not need treatment for a mildly enlarged prostate unless their symptoms are bothersome and affecting their quality of life. In these cases, instead of treatment, a urologist may recommend regular checkups. If benign prostatic hyperplasia symptoms become bothersome or present a health risk, a urologist most often recommends treatment.\n                \nLifestyle Changes\n                \nA health care provider may recommend lifestyle changes for men whose symptoms are mild or slightly bothersome. Lifestyle changes can include\n                \n- reducing intake of liquids, particularly before going out in public or before periods of sleep  - avoiding or reducing intake of caffeinated beverages and alcohol  - avoiding or monitoring the use of medications such as decongestants, antihistamines, antidepressants, and diuretics  - training the bladder to hold more urine for longer periods  - exercising pelvic floor muscles  - preventing or treating constipation\n                \nMedications\n                \nA health care provider or urologist may prescribe medications that stop the growth of or shrink the prostate or reduce symptoms associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia:\n                \n- alpha blockers  - phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors  - 5-alpha reductase inhibitors  - combination medications\n                \nAlpha blockers. These medications relax the smooth muscles of the prostate and bladder neck to improve urine flow and reduce bladder blockage:\n                \n- terazosin (Hytrin)  - doxazosin (Cardura)  - tamsulosin (Flomax)  - alfuzosin (Uroxatral)  - silodosin (Rapaflo)\n                \nPhosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors. Urologists prescribe these medications mainly for erectile dysfunction. Tadalafil (Cialis) belongs to this class of medications and can reduce lower urinary tract symptoms by relaxing smooth muscles in the lower urinary tract. Researchers are working to determine the role of erectile dysfunction drugs in the long-term treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia.\n                \n5-alpha reductase inhibitors. These medications block the production of DHT, which accumulates in the prostate and may cause prostate growth:\n                \n- finasteride (Proscar)  - dutasteride (Avodart)\n                \nThese medications can prevent progression of prostate growth or actually shrink the prostate in some men. Finasteride and dutasteride act more slowly than alpha blockers and are useful for only moderately enlarged prostates.\n                \nCombination medications. Several studies, such as the Medical Therapy of Prostatic Symptoms (MTOPS) study, have shown that combining two classes of medications, instead of using just one, can more effectively improve symptoms, urinary flow, and quality of life. The combinations include\n                \n- finasteride and doxazosin  - dutasteride and tamsulosin (Jalyn), a combination of both medications that is available in a single tablet  - alpha blockers and antimuscarinics\n                \nA urologist may prescribe a combination of alpha blockers and antimuscarinics for patients with overactive bladder symptoms. Overactive bladder is a condition in which the bladder muscles contract uncontrollably and cause urinary frequency, urinary urgency, and urinary incontinence. Antimuscarinics are a class of medications that relax the bladder muscles.\n                \nMinimally Invasive Procedures\n                \nResearchers have developed a number of minimally invasive procedures that relieve benign prostatic hyperplasia symptoms when medications prove ineffective. These procedures include\n                \n- transurethral needle ablation  - transurethral microwave thermotherapy  - high-intensity focused ultrasound  - transurethral electrovaporization  - water-induced thermotherapy  - prostatic stent insertion\n                \nMinimally invasive procedures can destroy enlarged prostate tissue or widen the urethra, which can help relieve blockage and urinary retention caused by benign prostatic hyperplasia.\n                \nUrologists perform minimally invasive procedures using the transurethral method, which involves inserting a cathetera thin, flexible tubeor cystoscope through the urethra to reach the prostate. These procedures may require local, regional, or general anesthesia. Although destroying troublesome prostate tissue relieves many benign prostatic hyperplasia symptoms, tissue destruction does not cure benign prostatic hyperplasia. A urologist will decide which procedure to perform based on the mans symptoms and overall health.\n                \nTransurethral needle ablation. This procedure uses heat generated by radiofrequency energy to destroy prostate tissue. A urologist inserts a cystoscope through the urethra into the prostate and then places needles through the scope into the prostate. Radiofrequency energy passes through the needles, creating heat that destroys prostate tissue.\n                \nTransurethral microwave thermotherapy. This procedure also uses heat generated by microwaves to destroy prostate tissue. A urologist inserts a special catheter through the urethra into the prostate and then applies microwaves to heat and destroy prostate tissue.\n                \nHigh-intensity focused ultrasound. This noninvasive procedure uses high-frequency sound waves to create heat that destroys prostate tissue. High-intensity focused ultrasound is performed under imaging guidance and requires no incisions.\n                \nTransurethral electrovaporization. This procedure uses electrical current to heat and vaporize prostate tissue. A urologist inserts an electrosurgical electrode through the urethra into the prostate and then applies electrical current to vaporize prostate tissue.\n                \nWater-induced thermotherapy. This procedure uses heated water to destroy prostate tissue. A urologist inserts a special catheter through the urethra into the prostate and then circulates heated water through the catheter to heat and destroy prostate tissue.\n                \nProstatic stent insertion. This procedure involves placing a spring-like device called a stent into the narrowed area of the urethra. Once in place, the stent expands like a spring to push back the obstructing prostate tissue and widen the urethra, allowing urine to flow freely. Stents are usually made of metal or plastic.\n                \nSurgery\n                \nIf medications and minimally invasive procedures fail to provide relief from benign prostatic hyperplasia symptoms, a urologist may recommend surgery. Surgery can remove the entire prostate or part of it. Surgical procedures include\n                \n- open prostatectomy  - laser surgery  - robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy  - transurethral resection of the prostate  - transurethral incision of the prostate\n                \nOpen prostatectomy. This major surgical procedure removes the entire prostate gland through an incision in the abdomen. Open prostatectomy is generally recommended for men who have a greatly enlarged prostate, urinary retention, or bladder damage.\n                \nLaser surgery. Laser surgery uses high-energy light beams to destroy prostate tissue. Laser surgery is less invasive than traditional surgery and has fewer side effects. Laser surgery is generally used to treat men with smaller prostates.\n                \nRobotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy. This minimally invasive surgical procedure uses a robot to assist the surgeon in removing",

            "raw_response": "Evaluate this medical answer based on the criteria below. Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: What are the treatments for What I need to know about Bladder Control for Women?\n\n    Reference Answer: Your doctor will likely offer several treatment choices. Some treatments are as simple as changing some daily habits. Other treatments require taking medicine or using a device. If nothing else seems to work, surgery may help a woman with stress incontinence regain her bladder control.\n                \nTalk with your doctor about which treatments might work best for you.\n                \nPelvic Muscle Strengthening\n                \nMany women prefer to try the simplest treatment choices first. Kegel exercises strengthen the pelvic muscles and don't require any equipment. Once you learn how to \"Kegel,\" you can Kegel anywhere. The trick is finding the right muscles to squeeze. Your doctor or nurse can help make sure you are squeezing the right muscles. Your doctor may refer you to a specially trained physical therapist who will teach you to find and strengthen the sphincter muscles. Learning when to squeeze these muscles can also help stop the bladder spasms that cause urge incontinence. After about 6 to 8 weeks, you should notice that you have fewer leaks and more bladder control. Use the pelvic muscle exercise log included with the Kegel Exercise Tips sheet (Item C) to keep track of your progress.\n                \nChanging Habits\n                \nTimed voiding. By keeping track of the times you leak urine, you may notice certain times of day when you are most likely to have an accident. You can use that information to make planned trips to the bathroom ahead of time to avoid the accident. Once you have established a safe pattern, you can build your bladder control by stretching out the time between trips to the bathroom. By forcing your pelvic muscles to hold on longer, you make those muscles stronger.\n                \nDiet changes. You may notice that certain foods and drinks cause you to urinate more often. You may find that avoiding caffeinated drinks like coffee, tea, or cola helps your bladder control. You can choose the decaf version of your favorite drink. Make sure you are not drinking too much fluid because that will cause you to make a large amount of urine. If you are bothered by nighttime urination, drink most of your fluids during the day and limit your drinking after dinner. You should not, however, avoid drinking fluids for fear of having an accident. Some foods may irritate your bladder and cause urgency. Talk with your doctor about diet changes that might affect your bladder.\n                \nWeight loss. Extra body weight puts extra pressure on your bladder. By losing weight, you may be able to relieve some of that pressure and regain your bladder control.\n                \nMedicines\n                \nNo medications are approved to treat stress urinary incontinence. But if you have an overactive bladder, your doctor may prescribe a medicine that can calm muscles and nerves. Medicines for overactive bladder come as pills, liquid, or a patch.\n                \nMedicines to treat overactive bladder can cause your eyes to become dry. These medicines can also cause dry mouth and constipation. If you take medicine to treat an overactive bladder, you may need to take steps to deal with the side effects.\n                \n- Use eye drops to keep your eyes moist.  - Chew gum or suck on hard candy if dry mouth bothers you. Make it sugarless gum or candy to avoid tooth decay.  - Take small sips of water throughout the day.\n                \nMedicines for other conditions also can affect the nerves and muscles of the urinary tract in different ways. Pills to treat swelling-edema-or high blood pressure may increase urine output and contribute to bladder control problems.\n                \nTalk with your doctor; you may find that taking a different medicine solves the problem without adding another prescription. The list of Medicines for Bladder Control (Item D) will give you more information about specific medicines.\n                \nPessaries\n                \nA pessary is a plastic ring, similar to a contraceptive diaphragm, that is worn in the vagina. It will help support the walls of the vagina, lifting the bladder and nearby urethra, leading to less stress leakage. A doctor or nurse can fit you with the best shape and size pessary for you and teach you how to care for it. Many women use a pessary only during exercise while others wear their pessary all day to reduce stress leakage. If you use a pessary, you should see your doctor regularly to check for small scrapes in the vagina that can result from using the device.\n                \nNerve Stimulation\n                \nElectrical stimulation of the nerves that control the bladder can improve symptoms of urgency, frequency, and urge incontinence, as well as bladder emptying problems, in some people. This treatment is usually offered to patients who cannot tolerate or do not benefit from medications. At first, your doctor will use a device outside your body to deliver stimulation through a wire implanted under your skin to see if the treatment relieves your symptoms. If the temporary treatment works, you may decide to have a permanent stimulator placed under your skin. The procedure is done in a hospital with local anesthesia. The stimulator sends electrical pulses to the sacral nerves, which run from the lower spine to the bladder, urethra, and anus. The goal is to improve bladder function and decrease symptoms.\n                \nSurgery\n                \nIf you have severe stress incontinence and want surgical treatment, there are several options. Ask your doctor about the risks and benefits of each, including recovery time, so that you can make an informed decision. Surgery to repair or support the urethra or bladder neck can correct both types of incontinence. In some cases, the surgeon will sew stitches in the tissue surrounding the urethra to firm up urethral closure and prevent leakage. Or the surgeon may insert a synthetic material-a sling-to support the urethra. Another type of surgery involves implanting an artificial urinary sphincter, an inflatable cuff that encircles the urethra. When the cuff is inflated, the urethra is closed. Urine collects in the bladder until you are ready to urinate. Then you deflate the cuff to allow urine to flow out. The cuff is controlled by a pump placed under the skin in the scrotum or labia.\n                \nThe National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) conducts and supports research into many kinds of diseases that affect public health. The NIDDK's Division of Kidney, Urologic, and Hematologic Diseases supports basic and clinical research into urologic disorders, including urinary incontinence in women. The goals of this research are to better understand the underlying causes of urinary incontinence and to discover new, effective treatments.\n                \nFor More Information\n                \nNational Kidney and Urologic Diseases Information Clearinghouse\n                \n3 Information Way\n                \nBethesda, MD 20892-3580\n                \nPhone: 1-800-891-5390\n                \nEmail: [nidduclearinghouse@info.niddk.nih.gov](mailto:nidduclearinghouse@info.niddk.nih.gov)\n                \nInternet: http://www.kidney.niddk.nih.gov\n                \nThis e-text is not copyrighted.

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: What causes Hemochromatosis?\n\n    Reference Answer: Primary Hemochromatosis\n                \nInherited genetic defects cause primary hemochromatosis, and mutations in the HFE gene are associated with up to 90 percent of cases.1 The HFE gene helps regulate the amount of iron absorbed from food. The two known mutations of HFE are C282Y and H63D. C282Y defects are the most common cause of primary hemochromatosis.\n                \nPeople inherit two copies of the HFE geneone copy from each parent. Most people who inherit two copies of the HFE gene with the C282Y defect will have higher-than-average iron absorption. However, not all of these people will develop health problems associated with hemochromatosis. One recent study found that 31 percent of people with two copies of the C282Y defect developed health problems by their early fifties.2 Men who develop health problems from HFE defects typically develop them after age 40.1 Women who develop health problems from HFE defects typically develop them after menopause.1\n                \nPeople who inherit two H63D defects or one C282Y and one H63D defect may have higher-than-average iron absorption.3 However, they are unlikely to develop iron overload and organ damage.\n                \nRare defects in other genes may also cause primary hemochromatosis. Mutations in the hemojuvelin or hepcidin genes cause juvenile hemochromatosis, a type of primary hemochromatosis. People with juvenile hemochromatosis typically develop severe iron overload and liver and heart damage between ages 15 and 30.\n                \nSecondary Hemochromatosis\n                \nHemochromatosis that is not inherited is called secondary hemochromatosis. The most common cause of secondary hemochromatosis is frequent blood transfusions in people with severe anemia. Anemia is a condition in which red blood cells are fewer or smaller than normal, which means they carry less oxygen to the bodys cells. Types of anemia that may require frequent blood transfusions include\n                \n- congenital, or inherited, anemias such as sickle cell disease, thalassemia, and Fanconis syndrome  - severe acquired anemias, which are not inherited, such as aplastic anemia and autoimmune hemolytic anemia\n                \nLiver diseasessuch as alcoholic liver disease, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, and chronic hepatitis C infectionmay cause mild iron overload. However, this iron overload causes much less liver damage than the underlying liver disease causes.\n                \nNeonatal Hemochromatosis\n                \nNeonatal hemochromatosis is a rare disease characterized by liver failure and death in fetuses and newborns. Researchers are studying the causes of neonatal hemochromatosis and believe more than one factor may lead to the disease.\n                \nExperts previously considered neonatal hemochromatosis a type of primary hemochromatosis. However, recent studies suggest genetic defects that increase iron absorption do not cause this disease. Instead, the mothers immune system may produce antibodiesproteins made by the immune system to protect the body from foreign substances such as bacteria or virusesthat damage the liver of the fetus. Women who have had one child with neonatal hemochromatosis are at risk for having more children with the...\n\n    Generated Answer: Hemochromatosis is a condition caused by too much absorption of iron from the diet, which can lead to iron overload in the body. There are two main types of hemochromatosis: hereditary and secondary.\n\nHereditary hemochromatosis is caused by inheriting mutations in genes that control how much iron the body absorbs. The most common type is caused by mutations in the HFE gene.\n\nSecondary...\n\n    Scoring guide:\n    1. Scientific Consensus: 1=Aligned, 0=No consensus, -1=Opposed\n    2.

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: How to diagnose Hemochromatosis?\n\n    Reference Answer: Health care providers use medical and family history, a physical exam, and routine blood tests to diagnose hemochromatosis or other conditions that could cause the same symptoms or complications.\n                \n- Medical and family history. Taking a medical and family history is one of the first things a health care provider may do to help diagnose hemochromatosis. The health care provider will look for clues that may indicate hemochromatosis, such as a family history of arthritis or unexplained liver disease.    - Physical exam. After taking a medical history, a health care provider will perform a physical exam, which may help diagnose hemochromatosis. During a physical exam, a health care provider usually      - examines a patients body    - uses a stethoscope to listen to bodily sounds    - taps on specific areas of the patients body      - Blood tests. A blood test involves drawing blood at a health care providers office or a commercial facility and sending the sample to a lab for analysis. Blood tests can determine whether the amount of iron stored in the body is higher than normal:1      - The transferrin saturation test shows how much iron is bound to the protein that carries iron in the blood. Transferrin saturation values above or equal to 45 percent are considered abnormal.    - The serum ferritin test detects the amount of ferritina protein that stores ironin the blood. Levels above 300 g/L in men and 200 g/L in women are considered abnormal. Levels above 1,000 g/L in men or women indicate a high chance of iron overload and organ damage.    If either test shows higher-than-average levels of iron in the body, health care providers can order a special blood test that can detect two copies of the C282Y mutation to confirm the diagnosis. If the mutation is not present, health care providers will look for other causes.    - Liver biopsy. Health care providers may perform a liver biopsy, a procedure that involves taking a piece of liver tissue for examination with a microscope for signs of damage or disease. The health care provider may ask the patient to temporarily stop taking certain medications before the liver biopsy. The health care provider may ask the patient to fast for 8 hours before the procedure.  During the procedure, the patient lies on a table, right hand resting above the head. The health care provider applies a local anesthetic to the area where he or she will insert the biopsy needle. If needed, a health care provider will also give sedatives and pain medication. The health care provider uses a needle to take a small piece of liver tissue. He or she may use ultrasound, computerized tomography scans, or other imaging techniques to guide the needle. After the biopsy, the patient must lie on the right side for up to 2 hours and is monitored an additional 2 to 4 hours before being sent home.  A health care provider performs a liver biopsy at a hospital or an outpatient center. The health care provider sends the liver sample to a pathology lab where the pathologista doctor who specializes in diagnosing diseaselooks at the tissue with a microscope and sends a report to the patients health care provider. The biopsy shows how much iron has accumulated in the liver and whether the patient has liver damage.\n                \nHemochromatosis is rare, and health care providers may not think to test for this disease. Thus, the disease is often not diagnosed or treated. The initial symptoms can be diverse, vague, and similar to the symptoms of many other diseases. Health care providers may focus on the symptoms and complications caused by hemochromatosis rather than on the underlying iron overload. However, if a health care provider diagnoses and treats the iron overload caused by hemochromatosis before organ damage has occurred, a person can live a normal, healthy life.\n                \n\n                \nWho should be tested for hemochromatosis?   Experts recommend testing for hemochromatosis in people who have symptoms, complications, or a family history of the disease.   Some researchers have suggested widespread screening for the C282Y mutation in the general population. However, screening is not cost-effective. Although the C282Y mutation occurs quite frequently, the disease caused by the mutation is rare, and many people with two copies of the mutation never develop iron overload or organ damage.   Researchers and public health officials suggest the following:   -...\n\n    Generated Answer: Hemochromatosis is typically diagnosed through a series of tests:\n\n1. Initial Blood Tests: These include a complete blood count (CBC) to check for anemia, and tests to measure the amount of iron in your blood (serum iron, ferritin, and transferrin saturation).\n\n2. Genetic Testing: If initial blood tests suggest hemochromatosis, genetic testing can confirm the diagnosis. This involves a blood test to look for mutations in the HFE gene, specifically the C282Y and H63D mutations.\n\n3. Liver Biopsy: In some cases, a liver biopsy might be recommended to assess the extent of liver damage.\n\n4. Imaging Studies: MRI or CT scans may be used to evaluate the degree of iron accumulation in organs like the liver.\n\n5. Family Screening: If you're diagnosed with hereditary hemochromatosis, it's recommended that your relatives undergo genetic testing to identify those who may also carry the mutated genes.\n\nEarly detection and treatment can prevent serious complications from developing.",

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: What causes Growth Failure in Children with Chronic Kidney Disease?\n\n    Reference Answer: Researchers have found that many factors cause growth failure in children with CKD. In addition to removing wastes and extra fluid from the blood, the kidneys perform important functions for a childs growth. Understanding normal kidney function and growth helps families understand what causes growth failure in children with CKD.\n                \nNormal kidney function helps maintain the\n                \n- balance of nutrients and minerals, such as calcium and phosphorus, in the blood. These minerals are essential for normal bone growth. The kidneys use a hormone called calcitriol, a form of vitamin D, to help bones absorb the right amount of calcium from the blood. The kidneys also remove extra phosphorus, helping balance phosphorus and calcium levels in the blood.  - bodys ability to use growth hormone. Growth hormone is necessary during childhood to help bones grow and stay healthy. The pituitary gland naturally produces growth hormone, which acts as a messenger to help the body grow. Growth hormone tells the liver to produce another hormone, called insulin-like growth factor, that travels to muscles, organs, and bones and tells them to grow.  - correct levels of erythropoietin in the body. Erythropoietin is a hormone that helps bone marrow make red blood cells.  - proper balance of sodium, also called salt; potassium; and acid-base levels in the blood. Acid-base balance refers to the amount of acid in the blood.\n                \nDamaged kidneys can slow a childs growth by\n                \n- causing mineral and bone disorder, which occurs when      - vitamin D is not turned into calcitriol, which starves the bones of calcium.    - phosphorus levels rise in the blood and draw calcium out of the bones and into the blood, causing the bones to weaken.    - creating an imbalance of sodium, potassium, and acid-base levels in the blood, also called acidosis. When blood is not balanced, the body slows growth to focus energy on restoring the balance.  - decreasing appetite. A child with CKD may not be hungry, or he or she may not have the energy to eat, which may lead to poor nutrition and slower growth.  - decreasing the production of erythropoietin. When erythropoietin levels are low, a child may develop anemiaa condition that develops when the blood does not have enough...\n\n    Generated Answer: Growth failure in children with chronic kidney disease (CKD) can be caused by several factors:\n\n1. Retention of waste products and toxins: As the kidneys fail to function properly, they cannot effectively remove waste products and toxins from the body. These toxins can interfere with growth hormone production and action, leading to growth failure.\n2. Nutritional deficiencies: Children with CKD may have reduced appetites, leading to inadequate calorie and nutrient intake, which can impair growth.\n3. Hormonal imbalances: CKD can lead to imbalances in growth hormone, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), and other hormones that are essential for growth.\n4. Chronic inflammation: CKD is often associated with chronic inflammation, which can negatively impact growth.\n5. Anemia: Many children with CKD develop anemia, which can further contribute to...\n\n    Scoring guide:\n    1. Scientific Consensus: 1=Aligned, 0=No consensus, -1=Opposed\n    2.

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: What to do for Growth Failure in Children with Chronic Kidney Disease?\n\n    Reference Answer: Children with CKD may lose their appetite or lack the energy to eat. To treat growth failure in children, a health care provider may recommend dietary changes, such as\n                \n- adding calcium. Children with CKD should get the recommended level of calcium for their age from their diet or from calcium supplements.  - monitoring liquids. Balancing the childs liquid intake based on his or her kidney disease is important. Some children will need to increase liquid intake, while other children will need to restrict liquid intake.  - limiting phosphorus. Children with CKD may need to limit phosphorus intake if they have mineral and bone disorder.  - monitoring protein. Children with CKD should eat enough protein for growth; however, they should avoid high protein intake, which can put an extra burden on the kidneys.  - monitoring sodium. The amount of sodium children with CKD need depends on the stage of their kidney disease, their age, and sometimes other factors. The health care provider may recommend either limiting or adding sodium, often from salt, to the childs diet.  - adding vitamin D. Children who do not get enough vitamin D through diet may need to take vitamin D supplements.\n                \nTo help ensure coordinated and safe care, parents and caregivers should discuss the use of complementary and alternative medical practices, including the use of dietary supplements, with the childs health care provider. Read more at www.nccam.nih.gov.\n                \nSome children will use a feeding tube to receive all their nutrition. A feeding tube is a small, soft plastic tube placed through the nose or mouth into the stomach. The child will receive supplements through the tube to provide a full supply of fluid and nutrients to help him or her grow and develop. Feeding tubes are most often used in infants; however, sometimes older children and adolescents benefit from them as well.\n                \nEncouraging children to develop healthy eating habits can help prevent poor nutrition and promote healthy growing. The health care team will work with parents or caretakers to develop a healthy diet tailored to meet the needs of their child.\n                \nMore information about diet and kidney disease is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Nutrition for Chronic Kidney Disease in Children.\n                \nMedications\n                \nA health care provider may prescribe medications that can help correct the underlying problems causing growth failure.\n                \n- A health care provider may prescribe phosphate binders when phosphorus levels in the blood rise and interfere with bone formation and normal growth. In the intestine, the medications bind, or attach, to some of the phosphorus found in food, causing the phosphorus to move through the intestine without being absorbed and exit the body in the stool. This process can decrease blood phosphorus levels and increase blood calcium levels. Phosphate binders come as chewable tablets, liquids, capsules, and pills.  - A health care provider may prescribe alkaline agents such as sodium bicarbonate to restore the acid-base balance in a child with acidosis.  - Synthetic erythropoietin is a man-made form of erythropoietin given by injection to treat anemia.\n                \nGrowth Hormone Therapy\n                \nWhen a health care...\n\n    Generated Answer: As a helpful and informative doctor, I would like to answer your question about growth failure in children with chronic kidney disease (CKD).\n\nGrowth failure is a common complication of CKD in children, and it can be caused by several factors, including malnutrition, hormonal imbalances, and accumulation of waste products in the body. To address growth failure in children with CKD, a comprehensive and individualized treatment plan should be implemented, which may include:\n\n1. Adequate nutrition: Children with CKD may require a high-protein, high-calorie diet to meet their nutritional needs and support growth.\n2. Hormonal therapy: Growth hormone and/or sex hormone therapy may be recommended to promote growth and development.\n3. Management of CKD: Aggressive management of CKD, including optimal control of blood pressure, anemia, and electrolyte imbalances, can help improve growth.\n4. Correction of metabolic acidosis: Metabolic acidosis, a condition characterized by an excess of acid in the body, can impair growth and should be treated with medications that neutralize acid.\n5....\n\n    Scoring guide:\n    1.

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: What are the treatments for IgA Nephropathy?\n\n    Reference Answer: Researchers have not yet found a specific cure for IgA nephropathy. Once the kidneys are scarred, they cannot be repaired. Therefore, the ultimate goal of IgA nephropathy treatment is to prevent or delay end-stage kidney disease. A health care provider may prescribe medications to\n                \n- control a persons blood pressure and slow the progression of kidney disease  - remove extra fluid from a persons blood  - control a persons immune system  - lower a persons blood cholesterol levels\n                \nControl Blood Pressure and Slow Progression of Kidney Disease\n                \nPeople with IgA nephropathy that is causing high blood pressure may need to take medications that lower blood pressure and can also significantly slow the progression of kidney disease. Two types of blood pressure-lowering medicationsangiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)have proven effective in slowing the progression of kidney disease. Many people require two or more medications to control their blood pressure. A person may also need beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and other blood pressure medications.\n                \nRemove Extra Fluid\n                \nA health care provider may prescribe a diuretic, a medication that helps the kidneys remove extra fluid from the blood. Removing the extra fluid can improve the control of blood pressure. Taking a diuretic along with an ACE inhibitor or an ARB often increases the effectiveness of these medications.\n                \nControl the Immune System\n                \nHealth care providers sometimes use medications to control a persons immune system. Since inflammation is the immune systems normal response, controlling the immune system can decrease inflammation. Health care providers may prescribe the following medications:\n           ...\n\n    Generated Answer: IgA Nephropathy, also known as Berger's disease, is a kidney disorder that can cause inflammation in the glomeruli, the tiny filtering units in the kidneys. Treatment for IgA Nephropathy typically aims to manage symptoms, slow the progression of the disease, and prevent complications. Here are some common treatments:\n\n1. Medications: Various medications may be prescribed to reduce inflammation, control blood pressure, and protect the kidneys. These can include corticosteroids, immunosuppressive drugs, blood pressure-lowering medications, and ACE inhibitors or ARBs to protect kidney function.\n2. Blood pressure control: Keeping blood pressure under control is essential for managing IgA Nephropathy, as high blood pressure can worsen kidney damage. Your doctor may recommend lifestyle changes, such as following a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and reducing sodium intake.\n3. Reducing protein in the urine: If you have protein in your urine, your doctor may recommend a low-protein diet to reduce the workload on your kidneys.\n4. Managing other health conditions: If you have other health conditions, such as diabetes or high cholesterol, managing these conditions can help protect your kidneys.\n5. Lifestyle changes: Adopting a healthy lifestyle can help manage IgA Nephropathy and prevent complications. This can include following a healthy diet, exercising regularly,...\n\n    Scoring guide:\n    1. Scientific Consensus: 1=Aligned, 0=No consensus, -1=Opposed\n    2.

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: How to prevent Kidney Disease of Diabetes?\n\n    Reference Answer: Blood Pressure Medicines\n                \nScientists have made great progress in developing methods that slow the onset and progression of kidney disease in people with diabetes. Drugs used to lower blood pressure can slow the progression of kidney disease significantly. Two types of drugs, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), have proven effective in slowing the progression of kidney disease. Many people require two or more drugs to control their blood pressure. In addition to an ACE inhibitor or an ARB, a diuretic can also be useful. Beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, and other blood pressure drugs may also be needed.\n                \nAn example of an effective ACE inhibitor is lisinopril (Prinivil, Zestril), which doctors commonly prescribe for treating kidney disease of diabetes. The benefits of lisinopril extend beyond its ability to lower blood pressure: it may directly protect the kidneys' glomeruli. ACE inhibitors have lowered proteinuria and slowed deterioration even in people with diabetes who did not have high blood pressure.\n                \nAn example of an effective ARB is losartan (Cozaar), which has also been shown to protect kidney function and lower the risk of cardiovascular events.\n                \nPatients with even mild hypertension or persistent microalbuminuria should consult a health care provider about the use of antihypertensive medicines.\n                \nModerate-protein Diets\n                \nIn people with diabetes, excessive consumption of protein may be harmful. Experts recommend that people with kidney disease of diabetes consume the recommended dietary allowance for protein, but avoid high-protein diets. For people with greatly reduced kidney function, a diet containing reduced amounts of protein may help delay the onset of kidney failure. Anyone following a reduced-protein diet should work with a dietitian to ensure adequate nutrition.\n                \nIntensive Management of Blood Glucose\n                \nAntihypertensive drugs and low-protein diets can slow CKD. A third treatment, known as intensive management of blood glucose or glycemic control, has shown great promise for people with diabetes, especially for those in the early stages of CKD.\n                \nThe human body normally converts food to glucose, the simple sugar that is the main source of energy for the body's cells. To enter cells, glucose needs the help of insulin, a hormone produced by the pancreas. When a person does not make enough insulin, or the body does not respond to the insulin that is present, the body cannot process glucose, and it builds up in the bloodstream. High levels of glucose in the blood lead to a diagnosis of diabetes.\n                \nIntensive management of blood glucose is a treatment regimen that aims to keep blood glucose levels close to normal. The regimen includes testing blood glucose frequently, administering insulin throughout the day on the basis of food intake and physical activity, following a diet and activity plan, and consulting a health care team regularly. Some people use an insulin pump to supply insulin throughout the day.\n                \nA number of studies have pointed to the beneficial effects of intensive management of blood glucose. In the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial supported by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), researchers found a 50 percent decrease in both development and progression of early diabetic kidney disease in participants who followed an intensive regimen for controlling blood glucose levels. The intensively managed patients had average blood glucose levels of 150 milligrams per deciliterabout 80 milligrams per...\n\n    Generated Answer: Preventing kidney disease of diabetes involves good control of your blood sugar levels and blood pressure.

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: What are the complications of Primary Biliary Cirrhosis?\n\n    Reference Answer: Most complications of primary biliary cirrhosis are related to cirrhosis and start after primary biliary cirrhosis progresses to cirrhosis. In some cases, portal hypertension and esophageal varices may develop before cirrhosis.\n                \nPortal hypertension. The portal vein carries blood from the stomach, intestines, spleen, gallbladder, and pancreas to the liver. In cirrhosis, scar tissue partially blocks the normal flow of blood, which increases the pressure in the portal vein. This condition is called portal hypertension. Portal hypertension is a common complication of cirrhosis. This condition may lead to other complications, such as\n                \n- edemaswelling due to a buildup of fluidin the feet, ankles, or legs, and ascitesa buildup of fluid in the abdomen  - enlarged blood vessels, called varices, in the esophagus, stomach, or both  - an enlarged spleen, called splenomegaly  - mental confusion due to a buildup of toxins that are ordinarily removed by the liver, a condition called hepatic encephalopathy\n                \nEdema and ascites. Liver failure causes fluid buildup that results in edema and ascites. Ascites can lead to spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, a serious infection that requires immediate medical attention.\n                \nVarices. Portal hypertension may cause enlarged blood vessels in the esophagus, stomach, or both. These enlarged blood vessels, called esophageal or gastric varices, cause the vessel walls to become thin and blood pressure to increase, making the blood vessels more likely to burst. If they burst, serious bleeding can occur in the esophagus or upper stomach, requiring immediate medical attention.\n                \nSplenomegaly. Portal hypertension may cause the spleen to enlarge and retain white blood cells and platelets, reducing the numbers of these cells and platelets in the blood. A low platelet count may be the first evidence that a person has developed cirrhosis.\n                \nHepatic encephalopathy. A failing liver cannot remove toxins from the blood, so they eventually accumulate in the brain. The buildup of toxins in the brain is called hepatic encephalopathy. This condition can decrease mental function and cause stupor and even coma. Stupor is an unconscious, sleeplike state from which a person can only be aroused briefly by a strong stimulus, such as a sharp pain. Coma is an unconscious, sleeplike state from which a person cannot be aroused. Signs of decreased mental function include\n                \n- confusion  - personality changes  - memory loss  - trouble concentrating  - a change in sleep habits\n                \nMetabolic bone diseases. Some people with cirrhosis develop a metabolic bone disease, which is a disorder of bone strength usually caused by abnormalities of vitamin D, bone mass, bone structure, or minerals, such as calcium and phosphorous. Osteopenia is a condition in which the bones become less dense, making them weaker. When bone loss becomes more severe, the condition is referred to as osteoporosis. People with these conditions are more likely to develop bone fractures.\n                \nGallstones and bile duct stones. If cirrhosis prevents bile from flowing freely to and from the gallbladder, the bile hardens into gallstones. Symptoms of gallstones include abdominal pain and recurrent bacterial cholangitisirritated or infected bile ducts. Stones may also form in and block the bile ducts, causing pain, jaundice, and bacterial cholangitis.\n                \nSteatorrhea. Steatorrhea is a condition in which the body cannot absorb fat, causing a buildup of fat in the stool and loose, greasy, and foul-smelling bowel movements. Steatorrhea may be caused by impairment of bile delivery to the small intestine or by the pancreas not producing enough...\n\n    Generated Answer: Primary Biliary Cirrhosis (PBC) is a chronic autoimmune disease that affects the liver. If left untreated or not managed properly, PBC can lead to several complications, including:\n\n1. Cirrhosis: PBC can cause scarring of the liver, leading to cirrhosis, a condition where the liver becomes hardened and unable to function properly.\n2. Liver failure: Advanced cirrhosis can lead to liver failure, which can be life-threatening and may require a liver transplant.\n3. Esophageal varices: Scarring of the liver can lead to increased pressure in the veins that supply the liver, causing them to widen and potentially bleed. This is known as esophageal varices.\n4. Portal hypertension: Increased pressure in the portal vein, which carries blood to the liver, can lead to various complications, including esophageal varices, ascites, and encephalopathy.\n5. Ascites: Fluid accumulation in the abdomen, known as ascites, can occur due to liver dysfunction and portal hypertension.\n6. Hepatic encephalopathy: Toxins can build up in the bloodstream and affect brain function, leading to symptoms like confusion, disorientation, and altered mental status.\n7. Metabolic bone disease: Abnormalities in vitamin D metabolism and bone density can lead to osteopenia or osteoporosis, increasing the risk of fractures.\n8. Gallstones and bile duct stones: Impaired bile flow can lead to the formation of gallstones or bile duct stones, causing abdominal pain, jaundice, and recurrent infections.\n9. Steatorrhea: Malabsorption of fats can occur due to impaired bile delivery to the small intestine or pancreatic insufficiency, leading to fatty stools and malnutrition.\n\nEarly diagnosis and management of PBC are crucial to prevent or delay the onset of these complications. Regular monitoring and follow-up care with a healthcare provider are essential for individuals with PBC.",

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: How to diagnose Primary Biliary Cirrhosis?\n\n    Reference Answer: A health care provider may use the following tests to diagnose primary biliary cirrhosis:\n                \n- a medical and family history  - a physical exam  - blood tests  - imaging tests  - a liver biopsy\n                \nA health care provider usually bases a diagnosis of primary biliary cirrhosis on two out of three of the following criteria:\n                \n- a blood test showing elevated liver enzymes  - a blood test showing the presence of anti-mitochondrial antibodies (AMA)  - a liver biopsy showing signs of the disease\n                \nHealth care providers may order additional tests to rule out other causes of symptoms. Health care providers diagnose the majority of people with primary biliary cirrhosis early in the course of the disease.\n                \nMedical and family history. Taking a medical and family history is one of the first things a health care provider may do to help diagnose primary biliary cirrhosis. He or she will ask a patient to provide a medical and family history.\n                \nPhysical exam. A physical exam may help diagnose primary biliary cirrhosis. During a physical exam, a health care provider usually\n                \n- examines a patients body  - uses a stethoscope to listen to sounds in the abdomen  - taps on specific areas of the patients body\n                \nThe health care provider will perform a physical exam to look for signs of the disease. For example, the liver may feel hard or ascites may cause the abdomen to enlarge.\n                \nBlood test. A blood test involves drawing blood at a health care providers office or a commercial facility and sending the sample to a lab for analysis. The blood test can show elevated levels of liver enzymes, such as alkaline phosphatase. A routine blood test may show high levels of the liver enzyme alkaline phosphatase in people who have primary biliary cirrhosis and are not yet showing symptoms.\n                \nThe health care provider will perform an AMA blood test to help confirm the diagnosis. A blood test will detect the presence of AMA in 90 to 95 percent of people with primary biliary cirrhosis.3\n                \nImaging tests. A health care provider may use the following imaging tests to examine the bile ducts. These tests can distinguish between primary biliary cirrhosis and other conditions that affect the bile ducts.\n                \n- Ultrasound uses a device, called a transducer, that bounces safe, painless sound waves off organs to create an image of their structure. A specially trained technician performs the procedure in a health care providers office, an outpatient center, or a hospital, and a radiologista doctor who specializes in medical imaging interprets the images. A patient does not need anesthesia. In addition to showing problems with the bile ducts, the images can show signs of advanced cirrhosis or complications.  - Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography uses magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to examine the bile ducts. MRI machines use radio waves and magnets to produce detailed pictures of the bodys internal organs and soft tissues without using x rays. A specially trained technician performs magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography in an outpatient center or a hospital, and a radiologist interprets the images. A patient does not need anesthesia, though a health care provider may use light sedation for patients with a fear of confined spaces. With most MRI machines, the patient lies on a table that slides into a tunnel-shaped device that may be open ended or closed at one end; some machines allow the patient to lie in a more open space.  - Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography uses an x ray to look at the bile ducts. A gastroenterologista doctor who specializes in digestive diseasesperforms the test at a hospital or an outpatient center. After lightly sedating the patient, the gastroenterologist inserts an endoscopea small, flexible tube with a light and a camera on the endthrough the mouth into the duodenum and bile ducts. The endoscope is connected to a computer and video monitor. The gastroenterologist injects a special dye, called contrast medium, through the tube into the bile ducts, which makes the ducts show up on the monitor. This test is more invasive than other imaging tests, and health care providers do not routinely need the test to make the diagnosis of primary biliary cirrhosis. A health care provider uses the test selectively when he or she is concerned that the blockage of the bile ducts has another cause, such as a gallstone or a narrowing of the large bile ducts due to inflammation or cancer. Patients may have pain, nausea, or vomiting after the test or may develop bacterial cholangitis or pancreatitisinflammation of the pancreas.\n                \nLiver biopsy. A liver biopsy is a procedure that involves taking a piece of liver tissue for examination with a microscope for signs of damage or disease. The health care provider may ask the patient to stop taking certain medications temporarily before performing the biopsy. The patient may receive local anesthesia so that he or she does not feel any discomfort during the procedure. The health care provider may use ultrasound or another type of imaging test to guide the insertion of the biopsy needle. Liver biopsy is considered minor surgery and carries risks of bleeding, infection, or injury to the lung or neighboring organs. However, these complications are rare. The health care provider sends the biopsy sample to a pathologista doctor who specializes in the diagnosis of diseases in bodily tissuesfor examination. The pathologist looks for signs of scarring, inflammation, or abnormal cells in the liver tissue. The pathologist also checks for evidence of bile duct destruction and scarring, which are typical features of primary biliary cirrhosis.\n                \nRuling out other causes. A health care provider may order additional tests to rule out other causes of symptoms, such as viral hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis, or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. The health care provider may also order tests to check for complications of primary biliary cirrhosis, such as osteoporosis or malabsorption of fat-soluble vitamins.\n                \nEarly detection. Health care providers diagnose the majority of people with primary biliary cirrhosis early in the course of the disease. Early detection allows for timely treatment and management of the disease, which can slow its progression and improve the patients quality of life.\n\n    Model Answer: To diagnose primary biliary cirrhosis, a healthcare provider may use a combination of the following tests:\n\n1. Medical and family history\n2. Physical exam\n3. Blood tests to check for elevated liver enzymes and anti-mitochondrial antibodies (AMA)\n4. Imaging tests such as ultrasound, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), or endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) to examine the bile ducts\n5. Liver biopsy to examine liver tissue for signs of damage or disease\n\nThe healthcare provider may also order additional tests to rule out other causes of symptoms and to check for complications of primary biliary cirrhosis. Early detection allows for timely treatment and management of the disease, which can slow its progression and improve the patient's quality of life.",

            "raw_response": "Evaluate this medical answer based on the criteria below. Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: What are the treatments for Primary Biliary Cirrhosis?\n\n    Reference Answer: Treatment for primary biliary cirrhosis depends on how early a health care provider diagnoses the disease and whether complications are present. In the early stages of primary biliary cirrhosis, treatment can slow the progression of liver damage to cirrhosis. In the early stages of cirrhosis, the goals of treatment are to slow the progression of tissue scarring in the liver and prevent complications. As cirrhosis progresses, a person may need additional treatments and hospitalization to manage complications.\n                \nMedications\n                \nHealth care providers prescribe ursodiol (Actigall, Urso) to treat primary biliary cirrhosis. Ursodiol is a nontoxic bile acid that people can take orally. Ursodiol replaces the bile acids that are normally produced by the liver, which are more toxic and can harm the liver. Treatment with ursodiol can reduce levels of bilirubin and liver enzymes in the blood. Early treatment with this medication reduces the likelihood of needing a liver transplant and improves survival.3 Early treatment provides the most benefit; however, ursodiol treatment late in the course of the disease can still slow the progression of liver damage. While ursodiol treatment improves the outcome of primary biliary cirrhosis, it does not cure the disease.\n                \nResearchers are studying the effects of several other medications on the progression of primary biliary cirrhosis. To date, none has shown the positive effects of ursodiol.\n                \nAvoiding Alcohol and Other Substances\n                \nPeople with cirrhosis should not drink any alcohol or take any illegal substances, as both will cause more liver damage. People with cirrhosis should avoid complementary and alternative medications, such as herbs. People with cirrhosis should be careful about starting new medications and should consult a health care provider before taking prescription medications, over-the-counter medications, or vitamins. Many vitamins and prescription and over-the-counter medications can affect liver function.\n                \nTreatment of Symptoms and Complications\n                \nHealth care providers treat symptoms and complications as follows:\n                \nItching. Antihistamines may help with mild itching. However, antihistamines often cause drowsiness, and a person should take antihistamines just before bedtime to help with nighttime itching. A health care provider will treat more problematic itching with cholestyramine (Locholest, Questran), which reduces cholesterol in the blood. Experts believe high levels of cholesterol let substances that cause itching build up in tissues.\n                \nDry eyes and mouth. Health care providers usually treat dry eyes and mouth with artificial tears and saliva substitutes, respectively. These products are available without a prescription. A health care provider may treat people whose symptoms do not improve with pilocarpine (Salagen) or cevimeline (Evoxac). People who have difficulty with dry eyes should see an ophthalmologista doctor who diagnoses and treats all eye diseases and eye disordersregularly. People with dry mouth should have regular dental exams.\n                \nPortal hypertension. A health care provider may prescribe a beta-blocker or nitrate to treat portal hypertension. Beta-blockers lower blood pressure by helping the heart beat slower and with less force, and nitrates relax and widen blood vessels to let more blood flow to the heart and reduce the hearts workload.\n                \nVarices. Beta-blockers can lower the pressure in varices and reduce the likelihood of bleeding. Bleeding in the stomach or esophagus requires an immediate upper endoscopy. This procedure involves using an endoscope to look for varices. The health care provider may use the endoscope to perform a band ligation, a procedure that involves placing a special rubber band around the varices that causes the tissue to die and fall off. A gastroenterologist performs the procedure at a hospital or an outpatient center. People who have had varices in the past may need to take medication to prevent future episodes.\n                \nEdema and ascites. Health care providers prescribe diureticsmedications that remove fluid from the bodyto treat edema and ascites. A health care provider may remove large amounts of ascitic fluid from the abdomen and check for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. A health care provider may prescribe bacteria-fighting medications called antibiotics to prevent infection. He or she may prescribe oral antibiotics; however, severe infection with ascites requires intravenous (IV) antibiotics.\n                \nHepatic encephalopathy. A health care provider will treat hepatic encephalopathy by cleansing the bowel with lactulose, a laxative given orally or as an enemaa liquid put into the rectum. A health care provider may also add antibiotics to the treatment. Hepatic encephalopathy may improve as other complications of cirrhosis are controlled.\n                \nOsteoporosis. A health care provider may prescribe bisphosphonate medications to improve bone density.\n                \nGallstones and bile duct stones. A health care provider may recommend surgery to remove gallstones or bile duct stones if they are causing pain or blocking the bile ducts.\n                \nLiver Transplant\n                \nIn advanced cases of cirrhosis, the liver loses its ability to function, leading to liver failure. Liver transplantation is a life-saving measure for people with liver failure. Liver transplantation is becoming increasingly common, and outcomes continue to improve due to advances in surgical techniques, immunosuppressive therapy, and posttransplantation care. Liver transplantation is generally reserved for people with advanced cirrhosis who have significant functional impairment or those who have developed serious complications such as jaundice, variceal hemorrhage, or refractory ascites.4\n                \nLiving Donor Liver Transplant\n                \nA living donor liver transplant is an option for some people. Living donors can donate part of their healthy liver to replace the damaged liver of a family member or friend. The donated portion of the liver regenerates in both the donor and recipient. The advantages of living donation include avoiding the long waiting time for a deceased donor organ and allowing the recipient to receive a transplant while he or she is still relatively healthy. However, living donation is a major operation that carries risks for the donor, including death. Potential donors must undergo thorough evaluation to ensure they are suitable candidates for donation.5\n\nThe best answer is not explicitly stated in the provided text snippet, but based on the information given, the following treatments are mentioned:\n\n1.

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: What causes Cirrhosis?\n\n    Reference Answer: Cirrhosis has various causes. Many people with cirrhosis have more than one cause of liver damage.\n                \nThe list below shows common causes of cirrhosis in the United States.2 While chronic hepatitis C and alcohol-related liver disease are the most common causes of cirrhosis, the incidence of cirrhosis caused by nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is rising due to increasing rates of obesity.\n                \nMost Common Causes of Cirrhosis\n                \nChronic hepatitis C. Hepatitis C is due to a viral infection that causes inflammation, or swelling, and damage to the liver. The hepatitis C virus spreads through contact with infected blood, such as from a needlestick accident, injection drug use, or receiving a blood transfusion before 1992. Less commonly, hepatitis C can be spread by sexual contact with an infected person or at the time of childbirth from an infected mother to her newborn.\n                \nHepatitis C often becomes chronic, with long-term persistence of the viral infection. Chronic hepatitis C causes damage to the liver that, over years or decades, can lead to cirrhosis. Advanced therapies for chronic hepatitis C now exist, and health care providers should treat people with chronic hepatitis C before they develop severe fibrosis or cirrhosis. Unfortunately, many people first realize they have chronic hepatitis C when they develop symptoms of cirrhosis. More information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, What I need to know about Hepatitis C.\n                \nAlcohol-related liver disease. Alcoholism is the second most common cause of cirrhosis in the United States. Most people who consume alcohol do not suffer damage to the liver. However, heavy alcohol use over several years makes a person more likely to develop alcohol-related liver disease. The amount of alcohol it takes to damage the liver varies from person to person. Research suggests that drinking two or fewer drinks a day for women and three or fewer drinks a day for men may not injure the liver.3 Drinking more than these amounts leads to fat and inflammation in the liver, which over 10 to 12 years can lead to alcoholic cirrhosis.4\n                \nNonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). In NAFLD, fat builds up in the liver; however, the fat buildup is not due to alcohol use. When the fat accompanies inflammation and liver cell damage, the condition is called nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH, with steato meaning fat, and hepatitis meaning inflammation of the liver. The inflammation and damage can cause fibrosis, which eventually can lead to cirrhosis.\n                \nExtra fat in the liver has many causes and is more common in people who\n                \n- are overweight or obese.  - have diabetesa condition characterized by high blood glucose, also called high blood sugar.  - have high blood cholesterol and triglycerides, called hyperlipidemia.  - have high blood pressure.  - have metabolic syndromea group of traits and medical conditions linked to being overweight and obese that makes people more likely to develop both cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. Metabolic syndrome is defined as the presence of any three of the following: large waist size, high triglycerides in the blood, abnormal levels of cholesterol in the blood, high blood pressure, and higher than normal blood glucose levels. NASH may represent the liver component of the metabolic syndrome.\n                \nNASH now ranks as the third most common cause of cirrhosis in the United States. More information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis.\n                \nChronic hepatitis B. Hepatitis B, like hepatitis C, is due to a viral infection that causes inflammation and damage to the liver. Chronic infection can lead to damage and inflammation, fibrosis, and cirrhosis. The hepatitis B virus spreads through contact with infected blood, such as by needlestick accident, injection drug use, or receiving a blood transfusion before the mid-1980s. Hepatitis B also spreads through sexual contact with an infected person and from an infected mother to child during childbirth.\n                \nIn the United States, hepatitis B is somewhat uncommon, affecting less than 1 percent of the population, or fewer than one in 100 people.5 In many areas of the world, however, hepatitis B is common. In some parts of Africa and in most of Asia and the Pacific Islands, about 5 to 7 percent of the population has chronic hepatitis B. In some parts of Africa, more than 8 percent of the population has chronic hepatitis B.6 For these reasons, hepatitis B is likely the major cause of cirrhosis worldwide. However, in the United States, hepatitis B ranks well behind hepatitis C, alcohol-related liver disease, and NASH.\n                \nTherapies for chronic hepatitis B now exist and health care providers should treat people with chronic hepatitis B before they develop severe fibrosis or cirrhosis. More information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, What I need to know about Hepatitis B.\n                \nAutoimmune hepatitis. Autoimmune hepatitis is a rare form of hepatitis in which the body produces antibodies against liver cells. This immune reaction results in liver inflammation and damage. Researchers believe genetic factors combined with environmental triggers contribute to the onset of autoimmune hepatitis. The condition is more common in females than males. Corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive drugs can slow disease progression and save lives.\n                \nGenetic disorders. Several inherited disorders affect the liver and increase the risk of developing cirrhosis. These include\n                \nWilson's disease, a disorder that disrupts copper metabolism in the liver\nAlpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, a disorder that affects the production of alpha-1 antitrypsin, a protein produced in the liver\nHemochromatosis, a disorder that disrupts iron metabolism in the liver\nGlycogen storage diseases, a group of disorders that affect glycogen synthesis or breakdown in the liver\nBiliary cirrhosis. Bile duct obstruction and destruction can lead to cirrhosis. The bile ducts carry bile from the liver to the gallbladder and then into the small intestine. Bile helps digest fats and absorbs fat-soluble vitamins. Blockage of the bile ducts is most commonly caused by\n                \nPrimary biliary cirrhosis, a disease of unknown cause in which the bile ducts become inflamed, scarred, and blocked\nPrimary sclerosing cholangitis, a disease of unknown cause in which the bile ducts become inflamed and scarred\nBlockage of the bile ducts by gallstones or tumors\nDrugs, toxins, and infections. Certain medications, toxins, and infections can cause liver damage and lead to cirrhosis. Examples include\n                \nCertain antibiotics, such as tetracycline and erythromycin\nCertain anti-seizure medications, such as valproate\nCertain cancer chemotherapy agents\nAmiodarone, a medication used to treat irregular heartbeats\nMethotrexate, a medication used to treat certain cancers, rheumatoid arthritis, and psoriasis\nToxins, such as arsenic, found in contaminated water\nViral infections, such as cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr virus\nParasitic infections, such as schistosomiasis\nCardiovascular diseases.

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: What are the complications of Cirrhosis?\n\n    Reference Answer: As the liver fails, complications may develop. In some people, complications may be the first signs of the disease. Complications of cirrhosis may include the following:\n                \nPortal hypertension. The portal vein carries blood from the stomach, intestines, spleen, gallbladder, and pancreas to the liver. In cirrhosis, scar tissue partially blocks the normal flow of blood, which increases the pressure in the portal vein. This condition is called portal hypertension. Portal hypertension is a common complication of cirrhosis. This condition may lead to other complications, such as\n                \n- fluid buildup leading to edema and ascites  - enlarged blood vessels, called varices, in the esophagus, stomach, or both  - an enlarged spleen, called splenomegaly  - mental confusion due to a buildup of toxins that are ordinarily removed by the liver, a condition called hepatic encephalopathy\n                \nEdema and ascites. Liver failure causes fluid buildup that results in edema and ascites. Ascites can lead to spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, a serious infection that requires immediate medical attention.\n                \nVarices. Portal hypertension may cause enlarged blood vessels in the esophagus, stomach, or both. These enlarged blood vessels, called esophageal or gastric varices, cause the vessel walls to become thin and blood pressure to increase, making the blood vessels more likely to burst. If they burst, serious bleeding can occur in the esophagus or upper stomach, requiring immediate medical attention.\n                \nSplenomegaly. Portal hypertension may cause the spleen to enlarge and retain white blood cells and platelets, reducing the numbers of these cells and platelets in the blood. A low platelet count may be the first evidence that a person has developed cirrhosis.\n                \nHepatic encephalopathy. A failing liver cannot remove toxins from the blood, so they eventually accumulate in the brain. The buildup of toxins in the brain is called hepatic encephalopathy. This condition can decrease mental function and cause stupor and even coma. Stupor is an unconscious, sleeplike state from which a person can only be aroused briefly by a strong stimulus, such as a sharp pain. Coma is an unconscious, sleeplike state from which a person cannot be aroused. Signs of decreased mental function include\n                \n- confusion  - personality changes  - memory loss  - trouble concentrating  - a change in sleep habits\n                \nMetabolic bone diseases. Some people with cirrhosis develop a metabolic bone disease, which is a disorder of bone strength usually caused by abnormalities of vitamin D, bone mass, bone structure, or minerals, such as calcium and phosphorous. Osteopenia is a condition in which the bones become less dense, making them weaker. When bone loss becomes more severe, the condition is referred to as osteoporosis. People with these conditions are more likely to develop bone fractures.\n                \nGallstones and bile duct stones. If cirrhosis prevents bile from flowing freely to and from the gallbladder, the bile hardens into gallstones. Symptoms of gallstones include abdominal pain and recurrent bacterial cholangitisirritated or infected bile ducts. Stones may also form in and block the bile ducts, causing pain, jaundice, and bacterial cholangitis.\n                \nBruising and bleeding. When the liver slows the production of or stops producing the proteins needed for blood clotting, a person will bruise or bleed easily.\n                \nSensitivity to medications. Cirrhosis slows the livers ability to filter medications from the blood. When this slowdown occurs, medications act longer than expected and build up in the body. For example, some pain medications may have a stronger effect or produce more side effects in people with cirrhosis than in people with a healthy liver.\n                \nInsulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Cirrhosis causes resistance to insulin. The pancreas tries to keep up with the demand for insulin by producing more; however, extra glucose builds up in the bloodstream, causing type 2 diabetes.\n                \nLiver cancer. Liver cancer is common in people with cirrhosis. Liver cancer has a high mortality rate. Current treatments are limited and only fully successful if a health care provider detects the cancer...\n\n    Generated Answer: Cirrhosis is a late stage of scarring (fibrosis) of the liver caused by many forms of liver diseases and conditions. Complications of cirrhosis can include:\n\n1. Portal hypertension: This occurs when the blood pressure in the portal vein (the large vein that brings blood to the liver) becomes elevated.\n2. Ascites: This is the accumulation of fluid in the abdominal cavity.\n3. Esophageal varices: These are enlarged veins in the esophagus that can...\n\n    Scoring guide:\n    1.

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: How to diagnose Cirrhosis?\n\n    Reference Answer: A health care provider usually diagnoses cirrhosis based on the presence of conditions that increase its likelihood, such as heavy alcohol use or obesity, and symptoms. A health care provider may test for cirrhosis based on the presence of these conditions alone because many people do not have symptoms in the early stages of the disease. A health care provider may confirm the diagnosis with\n                \n- a medical and family history  - a physical exam  - a blood test  - imaging tests  - a liver biopsy\n                \nMedical and family history. Taking a medical and family history is one of the first things a health care provider may do to help diagnose cirrhosis. He or she will ask the patient to provide a medical and family history.\n                \nPhysical exam. A physical exam may help diagnose cirrhosis. During a physical exam, a health care provider usually\n                \n- examines a patients body  - uses a stethoscope to listen to sounds in the abdomen  - taps on specific areas of the patients body\n                \nThe health care provider will perform a physical exam to look for signs of the disease. For example, the liver may feel hard or ascites may cause the abdomen to enlarge.\n                \nBlood test. A blood test involves drawing blood at a health care providers office or a commercial facility and sending the sample to a lab for analysis. Blood tests can show abnormal liver enzyme levels or abnormal numbers of blood cells or platelets.\n                \nBlood tests can help find the cause in people with diagnosed cirrhosis. For example, a health care provider may use blood tests to diagnose hepatitis B and C.\n                \nHealth care providers use three blood tests to measure the severity of cirrhosis:\n                \n- bilirubin, which tests the amount of bile pigment in the blood  - creatinine, which tests kidney function  - international normalized ratio, which tests the bloods ability to clot\n                \nThe results of these blood tests are used to calculate the Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) score. Experts developed the MELD score to predict the 90-day survival rate of people with end-stage liver disease. MELD scores usually range between 6 and 40, with a score of 6 indicating the best likelihood of 90-day survival. The MELD score is used to determine whether a person is eligible for liver transplantation.\n                \nImaging tests. Imaging tests can show signs of advanced cirrhosis, such as irregularities in the liver surface, gastric varices, and splenomegaly. These tests can also detect signs of complications, such as ascites and liver cancer.\n                \n- Ultrasound uses a device, called a transducer, that bounces safe, painless sound waves off organs to create an image of their structure. A specially trained technician performs the procedure in a health care providers office, an outpatient center, or a hospital, and a radiologista doctor who specializes in medical imaginginterprets the images. A patient does not need anesthesia.  - Computerized tomography (CT) scans use a combination of x rays and computer technology to create images. For a CT scan, a technician may give the patient a solution to drink and an injection of a special dye, called contrast medium. CT scans require the patient to lie on a table that slides into a tunnelshaped device where the technician takes the x rays. An x-ray technician performs the procedure in an outpatient center or a hospital, and a radiologist interprets the images. A patient does not need anesthesia.  - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machines use radio waves and magnets to produce detailed pictures of the bodys internal organs and soft tissues without using x rays. A specially trained technician performs the procedure in an outpatient center or a hospital, and a radiologist interprets the images. A patient does not need anesthesia, though a health care provider may use light sedation for patients with a fear of confined spaces. An MRI may include the injection of contrast medium. With most MRI machines, the patient lies on a table that slides into a tunnel-shaped device that may be open ended or closed at one end; some machines allow the patient to lie in a more open space.  - Elastography, also called liver stiffness measurement, uses either ultrasound or MRI to measure the stiffness of the liver. Scar tissue increases the stiffness of the liver. Elastography can show how much scarring is present with some reliability. Elastography is a relatively new test. However, this test promises to be helpful in showing how severe liver scarring is and whether the scarring is getting worse over time.\n                \nLiver biopsy. A liver biopsy is a procedure that involves taking a piece of liver tissue for examination with a microscope for signs of damage or disease. The health care provider may ask the patient to stop taking certain medications temporarily before the liver biopsy. The health care provider may ask the patient to fast for 8 hours before the procedure.\n                \nDuring the procedure, the patient lies on his or her back on an examining table. The health care provider applies a local anesthetic to numb the area, then inserts a thin needle into the upper abdomen and advances it under the rib cage into the liver. The patient may feel a pinch or mild discomfort when the needle is inserted. The health care provider uses ultrasound images to guide the needle to the correct place in the liver. Once the needle is in place, the patient holds still while the health care provider removes a small piece of liver tissue through the needle. The patient may feel pressure or a dull ache when the needle is removed from the liver. The entire procedure takes about 20 minutes. After the procedure, the patient rests on his or her right side for up to 2 hours and should avoid heavy lifting, bending, or straining for several days. A pathologista doctor who specializes in diagnosing diseasesthen examines the liver tissue in a laboratory.",

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: What are the treatments for Cirrhosis?\n\n    Reference Answer: Treatment for cirrhosis depends on the cause of the disease and whether complications are present. In the early stages of cirrhosis, the goals of treatment are to slow the progression of tissue scarring in the liver and prevent complications. As cirrhosis progresses, a person may need additional treatments and hospitalization to manage complications. Treatment may include the following:\n                \nAvoiding Alcohol and Illegal Substances\n                \nPeople with cirrhosis should not drink any alcohol or take any illegal substances, as both will cause more liver damage.\n                \nPreventing Problems with Medications\n                \nPeople with cirrhosis should be careful about starting new medications and should consult a health care provider before taking prescription medications, over-the-counter medications, or vitamins. People with cirrhosis should avoid complementary and alternative medications, such as herbs.\n                \nCirrhosis slows the livers ability to filter medications from the blood. When this slowdown occurs, medications act longer than expected and build up in the body. Some medications and vitamins may also affect liver function.\n                \nViral Hepatitis Vaccination and Screening\n                \nAll people with cirrhosis should consider vaccination against hepatitis A and B. An infection with one of these hepatitis viruses can cause cirrhosis to get worse. Vaccination can easily prevent both infections.\n                \nPeople with cirrhosis should also get a screening blood test for hepatitis C.\n                \nTreating Causes of Cirrhosis\n                \nHealth care providers can treat some causes of cirrhosis, for example, by prescribing antiviral medications for hepatitis B and C. In some instances, these medications cure the viral infection. Health care providers treat autoimmune hepatitis with corticosteroids and other medications that suppress the immune system. Health care providers can treat hemochromatosis and Wilson diseaseinherited forms of liver disease caused by the buildup of iron or copper in the liverif detected early. Health care providers usually treat liver diseases due to blockage or loss of bile ducts with ursodiol (Actigall, Urso). Ursodiol is a nontoxic bile acid that people can take orally. Ursodiol replaces the bile acids that are normally produced by the liver, which are toxic and build up in the liver when the bile ducts are blocked.\n                \nTreating Symptoms and Complications of Cirrhosis\n                \nItching and abdominal pain. A health care provider may give medications to treat various symptoms of cirrhosis, such as itching and abdominal pain.\n                \nPortal hypertension. A health care provider may prescribe a beta-blocker or nitrate to treat portal hypertension. Beta-blockers lower blood pressure by helping the heart beat slower and with less force, and nitrates relax and widen blood vessels to let more blood flow to the heart and reduce the hearts workload.\n                \nVarices. Beta-blockers can lower the pressure in varices and reduce the likelihood of bleeding. Bleeding in the stomach or esophagus requires an immediate upper endoscopy. This procedure involves using an endoscopea small, flexible tube with a lightto look for varices. The health care provider may use the endoscope to perform a band ligation, a procedure that involves placing a special rubber band around the varices that causes the tissue to die and fall off. A gastroenterologista doctor who specializes in digestive diseasesperforms the procedure at a hospital or an outpatient center. People who have had varices in the past may need to take medication to prevent future episodes.\n                \nEdema and ascites. Health care providers prescribe diureticsmedications that remove fluid from the bodyto treat edema and ascites. A health care provider may remove large amounts of ascitic fluid from the abdomen and check for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. A health care provider may prescribe bacteria-fighting medications called antibiotics to prevent infection. He or she may prescribe oral antibiotics; however, severe infection with ascites requires intravenous (IV) antibiotics.\n                \nHepatic encephalopathy. A health care provider treats hepatic encephalopathy by cleansing the bowel with lactulose, a laxative given orally or as an enemaa liquid put into the rectum. A health care provider may also add antibiotics to the treatment. Hepatic encephalopathy may improve as other complications of cirrhosis are controlled.\n                \nHepatorenal syndrome. Some people with cirrhosis who develop hepatorenal syndrome must undergo regular dialysis treatment, which filters wastes and extra fluid from the body by means other than the kidneys. People may also need medications to improve blood flow through the kidneys.\n                \nOsteoporosis. A health care provider may prescribe bisphosphonate medications to improve bone density.\n                \nGallstones and bile duct stones. A health care provider may use surgery to remove gallstones. He or she may use endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, which uses balloons and basketlike devices, to retrieve bile duct stones.\n                \nLiver Transplantation\n                \nIn advanced cases of cirrhosis, the only treatment option may be a liver transplant. Liver transplantation restores normal liver function and improves quality of life. However, it is a major operation that carries significant risks and substantial costs. People with cirrhosis who receive a liver transplant generally have a good chance of recovery if they follow posttransplant instructions carefully.\n\n\n    Model Answer: Treatment for cirrhosis includes avoiding alcohol and illegal substances, preventing problems with medications, getting vaccinated against hepatitis A and B, treating underlying causes of cirrhosis, and managing symptoms and complications such as itching, abdominal pain, portal hypertension, varices, edema, ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, hepatorenal syndrome, osteoporosis, gallstones, and bile duct stones. In advanced cases, liver transplantation may be necessary.",

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: How to prevent Diabetic Kidney Disease?\n\n    Reference Answer: People can prevent or slow the progression of diabetic kidney disease by\n                \n- taking medications to control high blood pressure  - managing blood glucose levels  - making changes in their eating, diet, and nutrition  - losing weight if they are overweight or obese  - getting regular physical activity\n                \nPeople with diabetes should see a health care provider who will help them learn to manage their diabetes and monitor their diabetes control. Most people with diabetes get care from primary care providers, including internists, family practice doctors, or pediatricians. However, having a team of health care providers can often improve diabetes care. In addition to a primary care provider, the team can include\n                \n- an endocrinologista doctor with special training in diabetes  - a nephrologista doctor who specializes in treating people who have kidney problems or related conditions  - diabetes educators such as a nurse or dietitian  - a podiatrista doctor who specializes in foot care  - an ophthalmologist or optometrist for eye care  - a pharmacist  - a dentist  - a mental health counselor for emotional support and access to community resources\n                \nThe team can also include other health care providers and specialists.\n                \nBlood Pressure Medications\n                \nMedications that lower blood pressure can also significantly slow the progression of kidney disease. Two types of blood pressure-lowering medications, angiotensinconverting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), have been shown to slow the progression of kidney disease. Many people require two or more medications to control their blood pressure. In addition to an ACE inhibitor or an ARB, a health care provider may prescribe a diuretica medication that helps the kidneys remove fluid from the blood. A person may also need beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and other blood pressure medications.\n                \nPeople should talk with their health care provider about their individual blood pressure goals and how often they should have their blood pressure checked.\n                \nManaging Blood Glucose Levels\n                \nPeople manage blood glucose levels by\n                \n- testing blood glucose throughout the day  - following a diet and physical activity plan  - taking insulin throughout the day based on food and liquid intake and physical activity\n                \nPeople with diabetes need to talk with their health care team regularly and follow their directions closely. The goal is to keep blood glucose levels within the normal range or within a range set by the persons health care team. More information about diabetes is provided in the NIDDK health topics:\n                \n- National Diabetes Statistics Report, 2014  - Diagnosis of Diabetes and Prediabetes\n                \nEating, Diet, and Nutrition\n                \nFollowing a healthy eating plan can help lower blood pressure and control blood sugar. A health care provider may recommend the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating plan. DASH focuses on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and other foods that are heart healthy and lower in sodium, which often comes from salt. The DASH eating plan\n                \n- is low in fat and cholesterol  - features fat-free or low-fat milk and dairy products, fish, poultry, and nuts  - suggests less red meat, and fewer sweets, added sugars, and sugarcontaining beverages  - is rich in nutrients, protein, and fiber\n                \nRead more about DASH at www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/dash.\n                \nPeople with diabetic kidney disease may need to limit sodium and salt intake to help reduce edema and lower blood pressure. A dietitian may also recommend a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol to help control high levels of lipids, or fats, in the blood.\n                \nHealth care providers may recommend that people with CKD eat moderate or reduced amounts of protein, though the benefits of reducing protein in a persons diet are still being researched. Proteins break down into waste products the kidneys must filter from the blood. Eating more protein than the body needs may burden the kidneys and cause kidney function to decline faster. However, protein intake that is too low may lead to malnutrition, a condition that occurs when the body does not get enough nutrients. More information about diabetes and diet is provided in the NIDDK health topics:\n                \n- What I need to know about Eating and Diabetes and What I need to know about Carbohydrate Counting and Diabetes  - Make the Kidney Connection: Food Tips and Healthy Eating Ideas and Eating Right for Kidney Health: Tips for People with Chronic Kidney Disease.\n                \nWeight Loss and Physical Activity\n                \nHealth care providers recommend that people who are overweight or obese lose weight to improve their bodies ability to use insulin properly and lower their risk for health problems related to high blood pressure. Overweight is defined as a body mass index (BMI)a measurement of weight in relation to heightof 25 to 29. A BMI of 30 or higher is considered obese. People should aim to keep their BMI lower than 25.4\n                \nExperts recommend physical activity as an important part of a weight loss program. People should aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity, or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity, or a combination of both, each week. Moderate-intensity aerobic exercise includes activities such as\n                \n- brisk walking  - swimming  - bicycling  - dancing\n                \nVigorous-intensity aerobic exercise includes activities such as\n                \n- running  - aerobics  - jumping rope  - boxing or kickboxing\n                \nIn addition, incorporating strengthtraining exercises into one's routine can help build muscle and boost metabolism. Strength-training exercises include\n                \n- lifting weights  - using resistance bands  - doing push-ups, squats, lunges, or leg lifts\n                \nPeople should talk with their health care provider before starting any new exercise program. More information about obesity and weight loss is provided in the NIDDK health topics:\n                \n- Changing Your Ways: Steps to a Healthier Approach to Weight Loss and Bariatric Surgery for Severe Obesity\n                \nSmoking Cessation\n                \nSmoking can damage blood vessels and increase the risk of many complications associated with diabetic kidney disease. Smoking cessation programs can help people quit smoking. More information about quitting smoking is available through the National Cancer Institute's Smoking Quitline at 1\u2013877\u201344U\u2013QUIT (1\u2013877\u2013448\u20137848).\n                \nMonitoring Kidney Function\n                \nPeople with diabetes should have their urine tested for albuminuria at least once a year. Albuminuria is a sign of kidney damage. If the test results show albuminuria, the health care provider may repeat the test to confirm the results. If the test results remain positive, the health care provider may recommend further testing to determine the extent of kidney damage. The health care provider may also recommend medications to slow the progression of kidney disease.\n                \nPeople with diabetes should also have their GFR measured at least once a year. The GFR measures how well the kidneys are filtering wastes from the blood. The GFR is calculated from the results of a serum creatinine blood test, age, sex, race, and other factors. An eGFR below 60 mL/min indicates kidney disease. More information about monitoring kidney function is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Monitoring Kidney Function.\n                \nKidney Transplant\n                \nA kidney transplant is surgery to replace a diseased kidney with a healthy one from a donor. A kidney transplant is usually performed when a person's kidney function has decreased to the point where dialysis or a transplant is needed",

            "raw_response": "Evaluate this medical answer based on the criteria below. Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: What are the treatments for What I need to know about Erectile Dysfunction?\n\n    Reference Answer: Your doctor can offer you a number of treatments for ED. For many men, the answer is as simple as taking a pill. Other men have to try two or three options before they find a treatment that works for them. Dont give up if the first treatment doesnt work. Finding the right treatment can take time. You may want to talk with your sexual partner about which treatment fits you best as a couple.\n                \nA doctor can treat ED by\n                \n- treating the cause of your ED:      - lifestyle changes    - changing the medicines you take to treat other health problems    - counseling    - prescribing medicines to treat your ED:      - medicine by mouth    - other forms of medicine    - prescribing a vacuum device  - performing surgery:      - implanted devices    - surgery to repair blood vessels\n                \nTreating the Cause of Your Erectile Dysfunction\n                \nThe first step is to treat any health problems that may be causing your ED. Untreated diabetes or high blood pressure may be part of the cause of your ED.\n                \nLifestyle changes. For some men, the following lifestyle changes help:\n                \n- quitting smoking  - drinking less alcohol  - increasing physical activity  - stopping illegal drug use\n                \nChanging medicines you take to treat other health problems. Talk with your doctor about all the medicines you are taking, including over-the-counter medicines. The doctor may find that a medicine you are taking is causing your ED. Your doctor may be able to give you another medicine that works in a different way, or your doctor may tell you to try a lower dose of your medicine.\n                \nCounseling. Counseling can help couples deal with the emotional effects of ED. Some couples find that counseling adds to the medical treatment by making their relationship stronger.\n                \nPrescribing Medicines to Treat Your Erectile Dysfunction\n                \nDepending on which medicine your doctor gives you, you may take it by mouth or by putting it directly into your penis.\n                \nMedicine by mouth. Your doctor may be able to prescribe a pill to treat ED. Common medicines include\n                \n- sildenafil (Viagra)  - vardenafil (Levitra, Staxyn)  - tadalafil (Cialis)  - avanafil (Stendra)\n                \nIf your health is generally good, your doctor may prescribe one of these medicines. You should not take any of these pills to treat ED if you take any nitrates, a type of heart medicine. All ED pills work by increasing blood flow to the penis. They do not cause automatic erections. Talk with your doctor about when to take the pill. You may need to experiment to find out how soon the pill takes effect.\n                \nOther forms of medicine. Taking a pill doesnt work for all men. You may need to use medicine that goes directly into your penis. You may use an injection into the shaft of your penis, or you may use medicine placed in your urethra, at the tip of your penis. The urethra is the tube that carries urine and semen outside of the body. Your doctor will teach you how to use the medicines. They most often cause an erection within minutes. These medicines can be successful, even if other treatments fail.\n                \nPrescribing a Vacuum Device\n                \nAnother way to create an erection is to use a device with a specially designed vacuum tube. You put your penis into the tube, which is connected to a pump. As air is pumped out of the tube, blood flows into your penis and makes it larger and firmer. You then move a specially designed elastic ring from the end of the tube to the base of your penis to keep the blood from flowing back into your body. You may find that using a vacuum device requires some practice.\n                \nPerforming Surgery\n                \nIf the other options fail, you may need surgery to treat ED.\n                \nImplanted devices. A urologist can place a device that fills with fluid or a device with bendable rods inside the penis to create an erection.\n                \nOne kind of implant uses two cylinders that fill with fluid like a balloon. Tubing connects the cylinders to a small ball that holds the fluid. You fill the cylinders by squeezing a small pump that the urologist places under the skin of the scrotum, in front of your testes. The pump causes fluid to flow into the two cylinders in your penis, making it hard. The fluid can make the penis slightly longer and wider. An implant that uses fluids instead of bendable rods leaves the penis in a more natural state when not in use.\n                \nImplants that bend most often have two rods that the urologist places side by side in your penis during surgery. You use your hands to adjust the position of the rods to make your penis straight. Your penis does not get larger. After sex, you bend the rods down.\n  ...\n\n    Generated Answer: Erectile dysfunction (ED) can be treated in several ways, depending on the underlying cause. Lifestyle changes such as quitting smoking, reducing alcohol consumption, increasing physical activity, and stopping illegal drug use can help. Changing medications that may be contributing to ED can also be effective. Counseling can help individuals and couples cope with the emotional aspects of ED. Oral medications like sildenafil (Viagra), vardenafil (Levitra, Staxyn), tadalafil (Cialis), and avanafil (Stendra) can increase blood flow to the penis. If oral medications are ineffective, injections or suppositories can be used. Vacuum devices can also be prescribed to create an erection. In severe cases where other treatments fail, surgical options such as penile implants may be considered. It's essential to consult a healthcare provider to determine the best course of treatment.",

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: What to do for What I need to know about Kidney Failure and How Its Treated?\n\n    Reference Answer: Eating healthy foods can help you keep up your energy and strength. All dialysis and transplant centers have a dietitian. The dietitian helps people with kidney failure learn about healthy food choices. You should talk with your centers dietitian to make a meal plan.\n                \nThe best diet for you will depend on which kidney failure treatment you choose after talking with your doctor.\n                \n- Hemodialysis      - Limit how much liquid and water you drink. Fluid can build up in your body between hemodialysis sessions. Also, many foods contain water. The extra fluid in your body can cause swelling and high blood pressure. Extra fluid in your body makes your heart work harder.\n                \n-      - Limit sodium, or salt. Watch out for sodium in frozen foods and prepared meals. You can also find sodium in canned foods, hot dogs, and fast food. Sodium makes you thirsty, which makes you drink more water and other liquids than you should.    - Read more in the National Kidney Disease Education Program (NKDEP) fact sheet Sodium.    - Limit potassium. Potassium is found in many fruits and vegetables such as potatoes, tomatoes, oranges, and bananas. Too much potassium can make your heart beat unevenly. Hemodialysis does not remove potassium from your body well.    - Read more in the NKDEP fact sheet Potassium.    - Eat protein-rich foods such as meat, fish, and eggs. Hemodialysis removes protein from your body.    - Read more in the NKDEP fact sheet Protein.    - Limit phosphorus. Phosphorus helps your bones, blood vessels, and muscles work.    - However, too much phosphorus can make your bones weak. Limiting phosphorus can be hard. Foods that contain phosphorus, such as meat and milk, also contain protein that you need. You should be careful to eat enough protein, yet not so much that you get too much phosphorus. You can avoid other foods that contain phosphorus, such as cola, tea, beans, and nuts.    - Read more in the NKDEP fact sheet Phosphorus.    - Find healthy ways to add calories to your diet. Calories are found in all foods and give your body energy. Many people on hemodialysis do not have a good appetite and do not get enough calories. Vegetable oils are good sources of calories. Vegetable oils include olive oil, canola oil, and safflower oil. Use them on breads, rice, and noodles. Hard candy, sugar, honey, jam, and jelly provide calories and energy. However, if you have diabetes, speak with your doctor or dietitian before eating extra sweets.    - More information about nutrition for people who are on hemodialysis is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Eat Right to Feel Right on Hemodialysis.    - Peritoneal dialysis      - Drink as much water and other liquids as you need. If you are holding too much fluid or too little fluid, your doctor needs to know.    - Limit sodium to control your thirst and help prevent heart problems. You can use spices other than salt to flavor your food.\n                \n-      - You may need to eat more potassium-rich foods. Peritoneal dialysis removes potassium from your body. Talk with your doctor or dietitian about the right amount of potassium for you.    - Eat protein-rich foods. Peritoneal dialysis removes even more protein from your body than hemodialysis.    - Limit phosphorus to keep your bones strong.    - You may need to limit your calorie intake. The salty water also contains some sugar. Your body absorbs the sugar, which can cause you to gain weight.    - Kidney transplant      - Limit sodium to help prevent heart problems.    - You should be able to eat...\n\n    Generated Answer: I understand you're looking for information about kidney failure and its treatment. Kidney failure, also known as renal failure, occurs when your kidneys lose their ability to effectively filter waste and excess fluid from your blood. This can lead to a buildup of toxins in your body and may cause serious health complications.\n\nThere are two main types of kidney failure: acute and chronic.\n\n1. Acute kidney failure: This is a sudden loss of kidney function that happens over a few hours or a few days. It can be caused by various factors such as infections, dehydration, severe injuries, or complications from surgeries. Acute kidney failure is often reversible with proper treatment.\n2. Chronic kidney disease (CKD): This is a gradual loss of kidney function that occurs over several months or years. The most common causes of CKD are diabetes and high blood pressure. Chronic kidney disease can progress to kidney failure if left untreated.\n\nTreatment for kidney failure depends on the underlying cause, the severity of the condition, and the presence of any complications. Here are some general guidelines:\n\n1. Dialysis: There are two types of dialysis: hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. Both methods aim to remove waste products and excess fluids from your blood when your kidneys are no longer able to perform these functions.\n\na. Hemodialysis: This involves using a machine to filter your blood outside your body. You'll typically undergo hemodialysis three times a week at a dialysis center or at home.\n\nb. Peritoneal dialysis: This method uses a special solution called dialysate that's infused into your abdominal cavity through a catheter. The dialysate absorbs waste products and excess fluids from your blood, which are then drained away.\n\n2. Kidney transplantation: In some cases, a kidney transplant may be recommended. This involves surgically implanting a healthy kidney from a donor into your body. A kidney transplant can offer a better quality of life compared to long-term dialysis.\n\nIn terms of dietary recommendations, it's essential to follow a balanced diet that's tailored to your specific needs. Generally, people with kidney failure should:\n\n* Limit sodium intake to reduce fluid retention and lower blood pressure\n* Restrict potassium intake, especially if you're undergoing hemodialysis, as excessive potassium can lead to cardiac arrhythmias\n* Consume adequate amounts of protein to maintain muscle mass and overall health\n* Limit phosphorus intake to prevent bone weakness and other complications\n\nIt's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional, preferably a nephrologist or a registered dietitian, to develop a personalized meal plan that addresses your unique nutritional requirements and health status.\n\nAdditionally, maintaining a healthy lifestyle, including regular exercise, stress management, and adherence to medication regimens, can significantly improve your overall well-being and slow the progression of kidney disease.\n\nI hope this information provides a comprehensive overview of kidney failure and its treatment options. Please feel free to ask further questions or seek clarification on any points that concern you.",

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: What causes Glomerular Diseases?\n\n    Reference Answer: A number of different diseases can result in glomerular disease. It may be the direct result of an infection or a drug toxic to the kidneys, or it may result from a disease that affects the entire body, like diabetes or lupus. Many different kinds of diseases can cause swelling or scarring of the nephron or glomerulus. Sometimes glomerular disease is idiopathic, meaning that it occurs without an apparent associated disease.\n                \nThe categories presented below can overlap: that is, a disease might belong to two or more of the categories. For example, diabetic nephropathy is a form of glomerular disease that can be placed in two categories: systemic diseases, since diabetes itself is a systemic disease, and sclerotic diseases, because the specific damage done to the kidneys is associated with scarring.\n                \nAutoimmune Diseases\n                \nWhen the body's immune system functions properly, it creates protein-like substances called antibodies and immunoglobulins to protect the body against invading organisms. In an autoimmune disease, the immune system creates autoantibodies, which are antibodies or immunoglobulins that attack the body itself. Autoimmune diseases may be systemic and affect many parts of the body, or they may affect only specific organs or regions.\n                \nSystemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) affects many parts of the body: primarily the skin and joints, but also the kidneys. Because women are more likely to develop SLE than men, some researchers believe that a sex-linked genetic factor may play a part in making a person susceptible, although viral infection has also been implicated as a triggering factor. Lupus nephritis is the name given to the kidney disease caused by SLE, and it occurs when autoantibodies form or are deposited in the glomeruli, causing inflammation. Ultimately, the inflammation may create scars that keep the kidneys from functioning properly. Conventional treatment for lupus nephritis includes a combination of two drugs, cyclophosphamide, a cytotoxic agent that suppresses the immune system, and prednisolone, a corticosteroid used to reduce inflammation. A newer immunosuppressant, mychophenolate mofetil (MMF), has been used instead of cyclophosphamide. Preliminary studies indicate that MMF may be as effective as cyclophosphamide and has milder side effects.\n                \nGoodpasture's Syndrome involves an autoantibody that specifically targets the kidneys and the lungs. Often, the first indication that patients have the autoantibody is when they cough up blood. But lung damage in Goodpasture's Syndrome is usually superficial compared with progressive and permanent damage to the kidneys. Goodpasture's Syndrome is a rare condition that affects mostly young men but also occurs in women, children, and older adults. Treatments include immunosuppressive drugs and a blood-cleaning therapy called plasmapheresis that removes the autoantibodies.\n                \nIgA nephropathy is a form of glomerular disease that results when immunoglobulin A (IgA) forms deposits in the glomeruli, where it creates inflammation. IgA nephropathy was not recognized as a cause of glomerular disease until the late 1960s, when sophisticated biopsy techniques were developed that could identify IgA deposits in kidney tissue.\n                \nThe most common symptom of IgA nephropathy is blood in the urine, but it is often a silent disease that may go undetected for many years. The silent nature of the disease makes it difficult to determine how many people are in the early stages of IgA nephropathy, when specific medical tests are the only way to detect it. This disease is estimated to be the most common cause of primary glomerulonephritisthat is, glomerular disease not caused by a systemic disease like lupus or diabetes mellitus. It appears to affect men more than women. Although IgA nephropathy is found in all age groups, young people rarely display signs of kidney failure because the disease usually takes several years to progress to the stage where it causes detectable complications.\n                \nNo treatment is recommended for early or mild cases of IgA nephropathy when the patient has normal blood pressure and less than 1 gram of protein in a 24-hour urine output. When proteinuria exceeds 1 gram/day, treatment is aimed at protecting kidney function by reducing proteinuria and controlling blood pressure. Blood pressure medicinesangiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)that block a hormone called angiotensin are most effective at achieving those two goals simultaneously.\n                \n\n                \nHereditary NephritisAlport Syndrome\n                \nThe primary indicator of Alport syndrome is a family history of chronic glomerular disease, although it may also involve hearing or vision impairment. This syndrome affects both men and women, but men are more severely affected than women. Men typically experience kidney failure between ages 20 and 40, while women generally do not experience kidney failure until later in life. Kidney transplantation is the only treatment option for end-stage renal disease due to Alport syndrome.\n                \nThin Basement Membrane Disease\n                \nThin basement membrane disease is characterized by thinning of the glomerular basement membrane, which is the layer of tissue that supports the capillaries within the glomerulus. This disease is usually inherited and is often detected during childhood. It is a relatively benign condition that does not lead to significant kidney damage or progression to kidney failure.\n                \nFocal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis (FSGS)\n                \nFocal segmental glomerulosclerosis is a type of glomerular disease in which scar tissue develops on the parts of some glomeruli. FSGS is one of the most common causes of nephrotic syndrome in both adults and children. It is more common among African Americans than Caucasians. FSGS is often associated with other conditions such as obesity, hypertension, and vesicoureteral reflux. The exact cause of FSGS is unknown, but it is believed to be related to a combination of genetic predisposition and environmental factors.\n                \nMembranous Nephropathy\n                \nMembranous nephropathy is a disease in which changes occur in the structure of the glomerular basement membrane. It is the second most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in adults. Membranous nephropathy is often associated with systemic diseases such as lupus, cancer, and infections. It is also associated with exposure to toxins such as heavy metals and certain medications. The exact cause of membranous nephropathy is unknown, but it is believed to be related to a combination of genetic predisposition and environmental factors.\n                \nRapidly Progressive Glomerulonephritis (RPGN)\n                \nRapidly progressive glomerulonephritis is a syndrome characterized by rapid loss of kidney function, often leading to kidney failure within weeks. RPN is often associated with crescent formation in most of the glomeruli and is frequently accompanied by severe oliguria (reduced urine production). The exact cause of RPGN is unknown, but it is believed to be related to a combination of genetic predisposition and environmental factors.\n                \nDiabetic Nephropathy\n                \nDiabetic nephropathy is a complication of diabetes mellitus that damages the kidneys' filters (glomeruli).",

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: How to diagnose High Blood Pressure and Kidney Disease?\n\n    Reference Answer: A health care provider diagnoses high blood pressure when multiple blood pressure testsoften repeated over several visits to a health care providers officeshow that a systolic blood pressure is consistently above 140 or a diastolic blood pressure is consistently above 90. Health care providers measure blood pressure with a blood pressure cuff. People can also buy blood pressure cuffs at discount chain stores and drugstores to monitor their blood pressure at home.\n                \nKidney disease is diagnosed with urine and blood tests.\n                \nUrine Tests\n                \nDipstick test for albumin. A dipstick test performed on a urine sample can detect the presence of albumin in the urine. Albumin is a protein in the blood that can pass into the urine when the kidneys are damaged. A patient collects the urine sample in a special container in a health care providers office or a commercial facility. The office or facility tests the sample onsite or sends it to a lab for analysis. For the test, a nurse or technician places a strip of chemically treated paper, called a dipstick, into the urine. Patches on the dipstick change color when blood or protein is present in urine.\n                \nUrine albumin-to-creatinine ratio. A health care provider uses the albumin and creatinine measurement to determine the ratio between the albumin and creatinine in the urine. Creatinine is a waste product in the blood that is filtered in the kidneys and excreted in the urine. A urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio above 30 mg/g may be a sign of kidney disease.\n                \nBlood Test\n                \nA blood test involves having blood drawn at a health care providers office or a commercial facility and sending the sample to a lab for analysis. A health care provider may order a blood test to estimate how much blood the kidneys filter each minute, called the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). The results of the test indicate the following:\n                \n- eGFR of 60 or above is in the normal range  - eGFR below 60 may indicate kidney damage  - eGFR...\n\n    Generated Answer: High blood pressure and kidney disease are commonly related conditions, and diagnosing them involves several steps.\n\nFor high blood pressure, a doctor will typically take multiple blood pressure readings on different occasions. If the readings are consistently high (130/80 mmHg or above), then the patient may be diagnosed with high blood pressure. The doctor may also order additional tests to check for organ damage or other health issues that may be contributing to the high blood pressure.\n\nTo diagnose kidney disease, a doctor will typically start by evaluating the patient's medical history, symptoms, and laboratory test results. They may order urine tests to check for protein and blood in the urine, which can be signs of kidney damage. Blood tests may also be ordered to measure the levels of creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), which are...\n\n    Scoring guide:\n    1.

Only return a JSON object.\n\n    Question: What to do for High Blood Pressure and Kidney Disease?\n\n    Reference Answer: Following a healthy eating plan can help lower blood pressure. A health care provider may recommend the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating plan. DASH focuses on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and other foods that are heart healthy and lower in sodium, which often comes from salt. The DASH eating plan\n                \n- is low in fat and cholesterol  - features fat-free or low-fat milk and dairy products, fish, poultry, and nuts  - suggests less red meat, sweets, added sugars, and sugar-containing beverages  - is rich in nutrients, protein, and fiber\n                \nRead more about DASH at www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/resources/heart/hbp-dash-index.htm.\n                \nA dietitian may also recommend this type of diet for people who have already developed kidney disease. A diet low in sodium and liquid intake can help reduce edema and lower blood pressure. Reducing saturated fat and cholesterol can help control high levels of lipids, or fats, in the blood.\n                \nHealth care providers may recommend that people with kidney disease eat moderate or reduced amounts of protein, though the benefits of reducing protein in a persons diet is still being researched. Proteins break down into waste products that the kidneys filter from the blood. Eating more protein than the body needs may burden the kidneys and cause kidney function to decline faster. However, protein intake that is too low may lead to malnutrition, a condition that occurs when the body does not get enough nutrients. People with kidney disease who are on a restricted protein diet should be monitored with blood tests that can show low nutrient levels.\n                \nIn addition, consuming too much alcohol raises blood pressure, so people should limit alcoholic drinkstwo per day for men and one per day for women.\n                \nA health care provider can help people change their diet to meet their individual needs.\n                \nPhysical Activity\n                \nRegular physical activity can lower blood pressure and reduce the chances of other health problems. A health care provider can provide information about how much and what kinds of activity are safe. Most people should try to get at least 30 to 60 minutes of activity most or all days of the week. A person can do all physical activity at once or break up activities into shorter periods of at least 10 minutes each. Moderate activities include brisk walking, dancing, bowling, riding a bike, working in a garden, and cleaning the house.\n                \nBody Weight\n                \nPeople who are overweight or obese should aim to reduce their weight by 7 to 10 percent during the first year of treatment for high blood pressure. This amount of weight loss can lower the chance of health problems related to high blood pressure. Overweight is defined as a body mass index (BMI)a measurement of weight in relation to heightof 25 to 29. A BMI of 30 or higher is considered obese. A BMI lower than 25 is the goal for keeping blood pressure under control.5\n                \nSmoking\n                \nPeople who smoke should quit. Smoking can damage blood vessels, raise the chance of high blood pressure, and worsen health problems related...\n\n    Generated Answer: If you have both high blood pressure and kidney disease, it's important to manage your blood pressure closely. A target of less than 130/80 mmHg is often recommended, but your doctor may suggest a different goal for you.\n\nLifestyle changes can help lower your blood pressure and protect your kidneys:\n\n1. Healthy diet: Follow a diet that is low in sodium (less than 2,000 mg per day), saturated fats, and cholesterol. Aim for plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat dairy products.\n2. Weight loss: If you're overweight, losing as little as 5-10% of your body weight can make a big difference in managing your blood pressure.\n3. Exercise: Regular physical activity, such as brisk walking, for at least 30 minutes a day on most days of the week can help lower your blood pressure.\n4. Limit alcohol: Drinking alcohol in moderation, if at all, is important. For most adults, that means up to one drink a day for women and up to two drinks a day for men.\n5. Quit smoking: Smoking can increase your risk of kidney disease and heart disease. Quitting smoking can help...\n\n    Scoring guide:\n    1.
